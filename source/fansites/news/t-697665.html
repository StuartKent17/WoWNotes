Anniversary Interviews: Players' Perspective<br />
In our continuing expansion of the World of Warcraft five-year anniversary site, we now bring to you an ongoing series of player interviews. We begin today with an intimate look at a unique role-play guild, Shadowclan, which has carved its own niche within the Warcraft universe. Read how World of Warcraft has shaped this guild's gameplay experience in different ways over the years on our anniversary page.<br />

3.3.3 World Event Bosses and Dungeon Finder<br />
Just to clarify some misconceptions about this new functionality, the summoning of holiday bosses is going away. Players can queue for these bosses via the Dungeon Finder or special holiday NPCs found in the world. Once the party is finalized, the group will be ported directly to the area where the holiday boss resides. Players can kill the holiday bosses as often as they want for standard loot (epic rings, trinkets, etc.), however, they will only drop one holiday-themed loot trove per player per day. These loot troves will have a chance of containing rare holiday items such as The Horseman's Reins.<br />
<br />
Why? I have nothing more to add except to ask the question because there has to be some good reason for this. Otherwise it should just be dropped because it's unnecessary... <br />
The way players were grandfathering in alt characters, scamming others by not having a summon available, and continually soft-resetting dungeons -- creating a major load on instance capacity -- was never intended.<br />
<br />
The change has some positive and some negative consequences, however, we feel it's the best way to make this a better system and more in-line with our original plans for World Event bosses. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23329143450-please-clarify-333-world-event-bosses.html))<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Item Changes<br />
We're working on a large forum post to go step by step with how some of the existing gear will be changing.<br />
<br />
Overall, we want everyone's damage, healing and tanking to stay about the same, but given that talent trees are changing at the same time as gear, it's going to take some adjustment. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23393139633-armor-pen-in-cataclysm.html))<br />
<br />
Separating the new Plushies from the In-Game Pets (They are now available on the Blizzard Store (http://us.blizzard.com/store/) by the way)<br />
There are no plans to separate the two at this time. It's funny because there were a number of complaints when the first two pets came out that felt it would make more sense if it came with something tangible.<br />
<br />
As far as the quality of the physical pets, they are very well made and our previous ones (like the Lurky) got a lot of good reviews from people I talked to so they will be along those lines as well. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23393069206-plush-petsreally-blizzard.html))<br />

Intent of Immolate change<br />
The intent of the Immolate buff was to buff Destro. This is one of those situations where you can't just say that Immolate is used by Demo so it buffs Demo too. It does. But it buffs Destro a lot more because Destro gets so much more benefit from Fire spells.<br />
<br />
If you think this is not the case, please provide us some evidence using math, simulations, target dummy parses or whatever. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23393069540-intent-of-immolate-change.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since 3.2, &quot;heroic&quot; means hard mode as the word implies, not 25man, where the only increased difficulty consists of finding 15 more people that know their class. It was always a misleading nomenclature, and only used because they already had the normal and heroic difficulties, and needed something to distinguish between the 10man and 25man versions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you didn't intend people to grandfather in masses of alts to try and kill holiday bosses over and over and over and over and over again, then raise the damn droprate of things like the Horseman's Reins. Specially if you consider that a lot of us have been trying to get this stupid thing for a few years in a row now, attacking the damn knight more than twenty times per day, and still not seeing them drop.<br />
This 'fun' solution will surely lower your server stress, but I suppose we'll all have to go gnash our teeth and shake fist at the RNG awarding the mounts and pets to the same person four nights in a row through a non-tradable holiday cache.<br />

#1- 00/56/15 = 13139 DPS<br />
#2- 56/00/15 = 13064 DPS<br />
#3- 55/00/16 = 12955 DPS<br />
#4= 00/13/58 Immolate = 12572 DPS<br />
#5= 00/13/58 Imp = 12519 DPS <br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler asking for an evidence of what the guy Sdfey is argueing about is right. Those numbers came from where? Actually I think the changes will be the buff for Destro and for Demo. Blues have already said that they want to buff Demo too. So they did together with buffing Destro. Even if those numbers are true, and I bet they are not, the difference between all these spec are minimal. Also Destro is the easiest spec to play with the best damage burst, meanwhile Affli and Demonology requires much more focus on what you do and additional utility.</div></div><hr />

tldr version: QQ, yes. But it's a stupid solution.<br />
<br />
So your solution to make people less prone to farming the event mounts is the let everyone have them? They're intended to be very rare. If they wanted dedicated people to be guaranteed them, they would just add a few harder/time-consuming achievements for the world event and let you get 'em like that.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather they have a system that lets them balance drop-rates better, this lets them do that because they don't have to worry about people getting 20+ chances a day -- or even more if they &quot;buy&quot; people's summoning.</div></div><hr />

yeah attempts are added difficulty the only thing wrong with that is that lag and DCs can get in the way. You have to play perfectly in order to have all the attempts left on all bosses</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crusoe</div><div class="date">2010-02-24, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am glad they cleared up the holiday mount thing a bit. I assume that it will be like the Oculus cashe that everyone can loot which also has a small chance to get a mount from. Good news is I will only have to kill the boss once per group, instead of five times per group, saving time and sanity. For me that means I only need to kill him five times a day instead of 25 times a day (I have 5 max level toons).<br />
<br />
It is interesting that &quot;grandfathering&quot;, or subing alts in so you can have more control over which toon will be riding your mount, is concidered a 'cleaver use of game mechanics', and is frowned upon. <br />

I guess my hope is that while the bag might be soulbound, the loot inside is not. So that if someone loots a big love rocket, or a headless horsemens mount, I can bribe them with 80,000g to trade it to me. I have nothing else to spend gold on, might as well spend it on vanity items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you didn't intend people to grandfather in masses of alts to try and kill holiday bosses over and over and over and over and over again, then raise the damn droprate of things like the Horseman's Reins. Specially if you consider that a lot of us have been trying to get this stupid thing for a few years in a row now, attacking the damn knight more than twenty times per day, and still not seeing them drop.<br />
This 'fun' solution will surely lower your server stress, but I suppose we'll all have to go gnash our teeth and shake fist at the RNG awarding the mounts and pets to the same person four nights in a row through a non-tradable holiday cache.<br />
<br />
Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
tldr version: QQ, yes. But it's a stupid solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So your solution to make people less prone to farming the event mounts is the let everyone have them? They're intended to be very rare. If they wanted dedicated people to be guaranteed them, they would just add a few harder/time-consuming achievements for the world event and let you get 'em like that.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather they have a system that lets them balance drop-rates better, this lets them do that because they don't have to worry about people getting 20+ chances a day -- or even more if they &quot;buy&quot; people's summoning.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was just going to answer with that, but saw that it was already written.<br />
Up the droprate of special mounts? You want everyone to run around with them? Stupid solution imo.</div></div><hr />

Yeah... that makes me sad. I just hope that they at least really consider implementing the &quot;go to the dungeon by yourself once to enable teleporting&quot; for cata, at least the &quot;release-run back&quot; won't have thousands of players asking &quot;omg, I don't know where to go! I just teleported!&quot;.<br />

Maybe instead of only an achievement for clearing the instance, you also get the teleport to it enabled on dungeon finder since the place changes from &quot;new!&quot; to &quot;farm status&quot; after the 1st clear.</div></div><hr />

No, its fine for the car dealer (they are all shady u know) to sell only 50% good cars. We call them heroic modes.<br />
<br />
9/12 first week for most guilds means the instance is too easy. If paragon killed LK first week and nobody else could do 5/12 for 4 weeks more thats fine, its not about weather things get killed fast or not, its about how many can kill shit instantly. LK normal is harder than all heroics except possibly deathwhisper and sindragosa/putricide.<br />
<br />

Yeah, because Putricide 25 &amp; co (hc) are so easy, that everyone and their mother can kill it with alts to go practice LK with two raids. Right? Your argument about the 10-mans stands, though, but the fact that you're making it reveals that you don't really know a lot about the encounter in hard mode.</div></div><hr />

You make no sense, with access to porting to the instances you can go out and about in the world and not have to rely on LFG or trade chat to get groups. You can go farming or questing, you can hide out in your favourite place, you don't need to be in dalaran all the time or even northrend at all to be close to the instance you are interested in going to. I've seen more people in Darnassus nowadays than ever before because people don't have to be in the main capital of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

I mean... Have you ever done gunship heroic? I dont think its even possible to wipe that even in naxx gear...<br />
<br />
<br />
Wait, what? Right now (three weeks in) 73 guilds on wowprogress.com show 9/12 complete. The first week it was something like 8 or 12 (I can't remember, but they all fit on the first page). How is that even *close* to &quot;most guilds&quot;. Wowprogress tracks *tens of thousands of guilds* and 73 of them have kill 9/12. That's a fraction of a percent. Three weeks in. You people live in some sort of fantasy world I swear. <br />
<br />
Edit: In a fit of &quot;very bored at work&quot; I just clicked &quot;next&quot; about 1250 times on wowprogress, and got as far as the 25,000th rated guild in 25 man. They had cleared 4/12 normal mode ICC, so every one of those 25,000 guilds is actively raiding to one extent or another, or has been within the last month or so. It would be really cool if they had a &quot;last&quot; button on the page, so I could see what the lowest rated guild is, but 25,000 will do for a start. If we assume that wowprogress tracks 25,000 guilds (It's way, way more, but I'm tired of hitting &quot;next&quot;), then the 73 that have completed 9/12 represent 0.3% of the total guilds tracked. By the way, only 435 guilds have any heroic mode kills at all. So a solid 1.7% of guilds (again assuming only 25,000) have killed *any&quot; heroic mode bosses. You're right, most guilds got 9/12 in the first week. What was I thinking?</div></div><hr />

On the contrary, limited attempts stop hardcore guilds from &quot;bashing their heads&quot; on encounters over and over again. No longer are they able to just run in and brute force their first few attempts, now they've got to seriously think and focus even moreso when taking on each encounter. Sure they have alt groups and effectively double or triple their attempts, but they still approach the encounter slightly differently to what they used to back in Ulduar/TBC days.</div></div><hr />

But destro needs to be fixed and the way to do it was to increase the glyph on inc i mean really just make our main nuke do more dmg. Idk who glyphs for inc in pvp i dont think many and a fix to this glyph would make things much better and not cause any unforeseen problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You seem to overrate the benefits of alt raids by a mile. <br />
<br />
What you need to realize is that there's a *huge* gear gap between the main and alt group(s). Alts can let you know there are two slimes on Putricide, or that backlash is aoe on Sindragosa, and let you kill them with mains using a strategy based on that. If the bosses are tuned properly, alt groups simply can't kill them and progress to what's behind. This is the case with Putricide at the very least - good luck getting him down with alts before they get some more gear. At that point it'll hardly matter anyway.<br />
<br />
The simple fact is that at least in ICC, having more than one alt raid is pointless. Those alts don't even need good gear, you just have to be able to reach the limit bosses on normal mode. Then you just see what they do on hard and wipe. <br />
<br />
If you wanted to get rid of alt raids altogether, you could either have an early gear check encounter and make the progression linear, or remove limited attempts; the issue stems from both of those. The limited attempt bosses are the gear check cockblocks in ICC, so LK remains, and will do so for some time, untouched by alts.<br />
<br />
Personally I think that 10-man scouting has a much larger impact, anyway.</div></div><hr />

Ensidia's. Paragon's. Yeah, there might be a bit of a gear gap because they probably didn't start working on alts until midway through ToC, but their alts are still rockin' 258/264 gear.<br />
<br />
One would think I know my own guild's alts' gear level, but thanks for the suggestion! <br />
<br />
There's a huge difference between 25 people sporting ~258 gear and 25 people sporting full 264 gear and best trinkets/weapons in the game. Then there's also the fact that they're, you know, alts; people don't play them at the same level as their mains. Off the top of my hat, the dps difference could be somewhere around 5-10%. <br />
<br />
That's the difference between continuously wiping at 5% to Putricide and killing him. I don't know what you call that, but I call it huge. If you can afford to drop 10% of your dps and still kill the boss, it's so easy that your alts wouldn't have needed the gear anyway to scout it.</div></div><hr />

So now we get to spend 25$ on a digital pet. I mean come on blizzard.. its ok to make money but do you have to be so harsh about it? The mark up on the plush is probably in the range of 80-90% (Yes thats pulled from my butt) and the cost to pay some one to make a graphic for a mini pet.. .. <br />
<br />
25 frikin dollars.. insane.Assuming that the split is $10 for the pet and $15 for the plushie (a fair split IMO, given the price on Lil' K.T. and the Pandaren Monk), $15 for a 9&quot; plushie, especially as well-constructed as Blizzard's are (I bought the Lurky plushie for a friend and she loves it, it's very well made), is entirely reasonable.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I think they should sell a $10 pet-only option, but you're seriously deluding yourself if you think these plushies are marked up dramatically.<br />
<br />
(That said, I'd buy a $25 Pet-and-Plushie version of Lil' K.T. in a heartbeat, and I already have Lil' K.T.)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobiasX</div><div class="date">2010-02-24, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the contrary, limited attempts stop hardcore guilds from &quot;bashing their heads&quot; on encounters over and over again. <br />
How does this make the encounter itself more difficult? It doesn't. It may make it last longer but that's nothing to do with the mechanics of the encounter itself, only the restriction placed outside of the encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
No longer are they able to just run in and brute force their first few attempts, now they've got to seriously think and focus even moreso when taking on each encounter.<br />
Some people learn most effectively by doing the fight, other people learn best by reading tactics and thinking about the fight outside of combat. There is no justification in screwing over the people who learn best from doing the fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure they have alt groups and effectively double or triple their attempts, but they still approach the encounter slightly differently to what they used to back in Ulduar/TBC days.<br />
That isn't necessarily a good thing. Being someone who started raiding in TBC I found it much more enjoyable when the raid leader started a strategy with &quot;Right, lets give this a go...&quot;.<br />
<br />
All limited attempts do is:<br />
* put people who learn more effectively from doing the fight than discussing tactics outside of the fight at a severe disadvantage<br />
* attempt to make a boss last longer when it isn't difficult enough an encounter to justify lasting that long<br />
* restricts the flexibility of tactics (unless all top-100 guild raiders gear up large numbers of alts) because they no longer have the option of trying something 'new' or 'interesting' just to see if it works any better; thus they are forced to spend time outside of the raid working out what the most effective tactic is instead of being in the raid, trying the tactics.<br />
<br />
@People who have trouble understanding the view that the encounters are not difficult enough:<br />
This was originally intended as the final raid dungeon of the Wrath of the Lich King expansion. It was supposed to be difficult not just for the average player but it was also hoped to be difficult for the amazing players as well. I'm a fan of the race for the final kill (in this case: Lich King 25-man Heroic) and so far ICC has disappointed in that.<br />
<br />
From a personal perspective I've got 3 major disappointments with ICC so far (with regard to The Race):<br />
<br />
1: Not all content was released at the start of the race.<br />
Blizzard artificially made the encounter last longer. This means that the encounters were not difficult enough to make the race interesting by themselves. If blizzard had truly believed that the encounters were difficult enough to last longer they would've (probably) released them sooner. Either way, blizzard chose to make content last longer than it should have.<br />
<br />
2: Lich King was killed, on 25-man, within the first week of him being available.<br />
Even on normal mode, this boss should have obliterated top-100 guilds for the first week of release and not needed limited attempts in order to do so. With or without bugs this boss should have crushed them, and it didn't.<br />
<br />
3: End-Of-Wing Heroic Mode 25-man bosses, were killed without within the first week of them being available.<br />
Again, these bosses should have obliterated top-100 guilds for the first week of being fightable, and without limited attempts.<br />
<br />
After the race was over Blizzard could have tuned the bosses down, as they always do, but for the first week Lich King normal, Lana heroic, Putricide heroic and Sindragosa heroic should have had a clean sweep with no guilds being able to take them down (even those with 10+ raids going in to give maximum experience to the players). All of these bosses are meant to be the pinacle of this expansion and while the average (and many far above average) guilds have been stumped by them the focus of the race is always going to be on the top-50 to 100 guilds that are competing for that coverted World First.<br />
<br />
So far it looks like only the Lich King is surviving as long as he should be, and I wonder how much of that is down to blizzard artificially restricting the number of attempts players had on him.<br />
<br />
Before sarcastically replying that I'm being elitist, unrealistic or just unfair to blizzard, answer the following questions:<br />
<br />
How long was Alone in the Darkness (Yogg+0) available to players before it was defeated? <br />
What restrictions were placed on players to prevent them attempting Alone in the Darkness as many times as they wanted to?<br />
<br />
To me, Ulduar is an example of how raid instances should be done (without the Algalon restrictions). Yogg+0 was hard enough to make guilds take a hell of a long time to kill him to the point where many guilds were in a state of shock when Stars finally took him down. This is how end-of-raid bosses should be and, without a doubt, definitely how end-of-expansion bosses should be.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shamslam</div><div class="date">2010-02-24, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait, what? Right now (three weeks in) 73 guilds on wowprogress.com show 9/12 complete. The first week it was something like 8 or 12 (I can't remember, but they all fit on the first page). How is that even *close* to &quot;most guilds&quot;. Wowprogress tracks *tens of thousands of guilds* and 73 of them have kill 9/12. That's a fraction of a percent. Three weeks in. You people live in some sort of fantasy world I swear. <br />
<br />
Edit: In a fit of &quot;very bored at work&quot; I just clicked &quot;next&quot; about 1250 times on wowprogress, and got as far as the 25,000th rated guild in 25 man. They had cleared 4/12 normal mode ICC, so every one of those 25,000 guilds is actively raiding to one extent or another, or has been within the last month or so. It would be really cool if they had a &quot;last&quot; button on the page, so I could see what the lowest rated guild is, but 25,000 will do for a start. If we assume that wowprogress tracks 25,000 guilds (It's way, way more, but I'm tired of hitting &quot;next&quot;), then the 73 that have completed 9/12 represent 0.3% of the total guilds tracked. By the way, only 435 guilds have any heroic mode kills at all. So a solid 1.7% of guilds (again assuming only 25,000) have killed *any&quot; heroic mode bosses. You're right, most guilds got 9/12 in the first week. What was I thinking?<br />
<br />
<br />
This, a hundred thousand times over. That thing that drove me away from WoW more than anything was all the wannabe elitist pricks that can't raid but look at the top 20 guilds and go &quot;LAWLAWLALWL WOW TOO EZ GOSH BLIZZERDDD!&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean hell, my old server has 2 guilds at 11/12 normal ICC25, and only 1 guild has done hard modes in ICC10. Even if the top 500 guilds in the world found WoW too easy, there are thousands upon thousands of guilds who will think normal LK25 will be a cockblock for many weeks.</div></div><hr />

&quot;most guilds&quot; can matter after the race is over, when blizzard nerfs everything, as they always do, to the extent that normal players can kill it.<br />
<br />
Also: If step 1 (everything being released at the start) had happened then this wouldn't be an issue to most guilds as they'd still be working on Saurfang or end-of-wing normal mode bosses (hopefully).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think everyone should have to wait for 4.0 to kill LK. To me, the first race was for 25-man LK normal just as it was for 25-man Yogg+4. It was the first part of the race, and it should've lasted a hell of a lot longer than it did (unlike Yogg+4).</div></div><hr />

I didn't raid in vanilla, because I wasn't playing the game then.<br />
Btw, Taunt (at least Dark Command) is still on spell hit and generates no threat. I've been melee hit capped for a long time and Taunts can still miss. Taunts have never generated threat, they simply 'set' your threat equal to the personal currently highest on the threat table at the moment of the spell's resolution.<br />
<br />
Bosses should still last longer than they are, without gear cockblocks, without bugs, and without stupid mechanics (oh look, limited time to fight the boss..).<br />
<br />
<br />
Who gives a flying shit about &quot;the race&quot;? <br />
A lot more people than you seem to be aware of.<br />
<br />
<br />
Putricide is doing a damn good job of kicking people's asses, and less than 200 guilds have Deathwhisper 25-H down. Why do you care so much?<br />
Because this is supposed to be the final raid of Wrath of the Lich King. It is supposed to be difficult, it is supposed to be challenging and it is supposed to be damn hard for everybody, including people who play this game to what most people would consider an excessive degree.<br />
<br />
It isn't.<br />
<br />
Evidence:<br />
* Lich King (25-man) Normal Mode: Dead in first week he could be attempted<br />
* Lana'thel (25-man) Heroic Mode: Dead in first week she could be attempted<br />
* Professor Putricide (25-man) Heroic Mode: Dead in first week he could be attempted<br />
* Sindragosa (25-man) Heroic Mode: Dead in first week she could be attempted<br />
<br />
For those who are curious about the contribution of The Lich King to the Warcraft universe:<br />
* Warcraft 3: 2 of the 4 single-player campaigns tell his story, 1 of the 4 races is his army<br />
* Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne: at least 1 of the single-player campaigns furthers his story<br />
* World of Warcraft (vanilla): 2 entire zones are dedicated to his influence on the world, the final raid before TBC was also focussed on one of his disciples (KT)<br />
* World of Warcraft (WotLK): an entire expansion focussed on the character, a class created Based On His Character is added (the first class ever added to WoW), etc, etc...<br />
End result: Dead within how many hours of being available despite not having been on the PTR...<br />

<br />
Stars might have been at it for rather long, since their strategy pretty much relied (no pun intended) on all the stars aligning. I doubt the rest of the guilds were on him for that long - I know we weren't. I recall it taking several nights of non-serious practice and then a few nights of grinding after realizing it's doable. The encounter did have a rather steep gear requirement, so it couldn't have been defeated at the start, but generally I think people give it a bit too much credit. It's rather pointless to compare other encounters to the kill dates of Yogg +4 and Yogg +0.<br />
<br />
On the matter of ICC, while the ten first heroic bosses are somewhat too easy, I feel Putricide was pretty okay. He wouldn't have survived so well if not for limited attempts though. BQL and Sindragosa should definitely have been harder. And while in normal mode he isn't all that mighty, Lich King heroic is a seriously hard encounter which doesn't disappoint.</div></div><hr />

Just seems really boring.<br />
<br />
A congratulations seems to be in order, though!<br />
<br />
For the most part, at least in 10-man, the fights are extremely close to what they were in non-heroic.<br />
<br />
Lord Marrowgar:<br />
Bone spikes while doing bone storm.<br />
Bone storm hits harder.<br />
Flames last longer, go out faster, and hit harder.<br />
<br />
Lady Deathwhisper:<br />
Mind controls.<br />
Has one add come down the stairs in 10-man.<br />
Immune to taunt.<br />
<br />
Gunship:<br />
Rockets knock back.<br />
Damage amped up across the board.<br />
<br />
Saurfang:<br />
Blood beasts have an ability that lasts 10 seconds and increases the damage the blood beast does by 300% and snares everyone on the platform by 80%.<br />
Generates blood power faster.<br />
<br />
Festergut:<br />
Putricide throws malleable goo from the platform above. The goo can target anybody in the room, including melee and tanks.<br />
<br />
Rotface:<br />
Putricide casts vile gas on random people. The vile gas debuff causes you to stop moving entirely.<br />
The slime pools now cause a stacking debuff that lower your movement speed by 10%, stacks 10 times.<br />
<br />
Putricide:<br />
Casts a debuff on people called &quot;unbound plague&quot;. Unbound plague lasts 1 minute total, deals damage every second, but the damage ramps up every second. It is passed to another player by getting close to them. Unbound plague keeps its timer even after being traded away. (I.E. Waiting until there's 50 seconds left then trading it to player B will give player B unbound plague with 50 seconds left)<br />
After trading away the unbound plague debuff, you get another debuff that increases damage taken from unbound plague by 250%. This debuff lasts 1 minute and can stack to 20.<br />
Instead of tear gas transitions, he now summons one of each type of goo. There isn't a stun on the players in this phase.<br />
<br />
Blood Princes:<br />
Have a debuff called &quot;shadow prison&quot;. Every time you move, shadow prison gets an additional stack. Shadow prison deals damage per stack WHILE MOVING. I.E. If you get to a 38 stack and stop moving and just stand still, you will take no damage from it. If you start moving again, you reset the timer and take damage every second you're moving, and 38 stacks will blow you apart.<br />
<br />
Blood Queen:<br />
More damage. Probably easier than Blood Princes on heroic.<br />
<br />
Valithria:<br />
The buff from the portals now deal 300 damage per stack to the person who has it.<br />
Valithria takes constant damage from any orb left up inside the portal.<br />
The frostbolt volley is also a mini mana burn.<br />
<br />

Excuse me, What?<br />
<br />
You also have to keep in mind that if it weren't for Arthas we would be playing a different game. There are far more than 2 zones that are different thanks to him, not to mention allegiances, people dead, and the basic mentality of the world as a whole. He has about as much to do with things as Medivh, if not more.<br />
Yes, it's extremely disappointing. The least they could have done was make the fight real neat like fighting Illidan or Archimonde. Instead you may as well just fight Saurfang again.</div></div><hr />

I've been melee hit capped for a long time and Taunts can still miss. Taunts have never generated threat, they simply 'set' your threat equal to the personal currently highest on the threat table at the moment of the spell's resolution.<br />
<br />
True it is still spell hit but that's why they have glyphs so you can guarantee your taunt will always work if it is something important to you. What the person was referring to about taunts generating threat is that until the original Naxx was released all Taunt did was temporarily make the mob focus on you for 5 seconds. It would not set your threat equal to the person who had aggro. That's what he meant about it being an annoying mechanic. Taunt was changed to the way it works currently with the release of Naxx so that you could have a tank swap during the 4 horseman fight.<br />
<br />
Oh and technically the Pally single target taunt does generate threat as it does roughly 2000 Holy damage in addition to taunting the target.</div></div><hr />

Paragon attempted Yogg +0 for 5 days. We couldn't start doing it before because we simply didn't have players/classes for it.

A lot more people can run a 4.2 40 than have killed the Lich King.<br />

The problem is the lack of &quot;medium&quot; modes. Back in vanilla and TBC, there was separation from the top 100 guilds to the top 1000 to the top 10000, etc. Nowadays, unless you're in one of those uber guilds, there is little that separates you from the faceroll guilds. The difficulty essentially jumps from faceroll to nightmare without any intervening steps. An 11/12 guild looks almost exactly the same as all the 4/12 guilds running around and people can easily PuG their way to 4/12. <br />
<br />
And I believe Blizzard recently buffed heroic Arthas because they haven't put in the quest rewards into the game just yet.</div></div><hr />

exactly if normal LK was that hard...which he is!!!!! only 1 guild beat him so far on my server! ally guild.<br />
<br />
If normal 25 LK was that hard for the top 100 guilds who get paid to play wow then HARD MODE would be sooooo rediculous ***LISTEN HERE*** --&gt; that the gear drops from 25man would NOT NOT NOT NOT be enough for them to even attempt Hard mode on marrowgar. <br />

gear makes downing things easier. Its all progression. If your in full 264 with a 6k GS then Hardmode marrow will be possible.</div></div><hr />

do you &quot;omg-wtf-bliz-icc-iz-ez-mode&quot; nerd rage whiners still find these numbers that HUGE as you're trying to prove they are?<br />
<br />
<br />
Those numbers don't mean anything if you are taking percentages based on the entire WoW population. Any useful statistic for heroic mode should be taken with only hardcore guilds in mind. I'll ask you this: do you think Blizzard balances these encounters based on data from the hardcore guilds or the casual guilds? I'm sure you know the answer and that is why I stand by what I said.<br />
<br />
Fact is only a few amount of guilds, the hardcore guilds, actually care about and attempt heroic. Casual guilds certainly do not possess the time investment or skill dedication to compete with these guilds on Heroic encounters therefore they shouldn't be included.<br />
<br />
Sindragosa, Putricide, and Lich King are the hardest bosses in ICC. I'll admit some of the others are somewhat challenging in the fact that 1 buffoon making a single mistake can wipe you entirely. If your guild has that 1 player that makes a mistake every attempt; well that's too bad.<br />
<br />
To the naysayers that refuse to believe some of the heroic encounters are easy. Well sorry to burst your bubble but some of them actually are easy. Marrowgar, Gunship, and Rotface come to mind. I guess I should clarify. They are easy for the guilds that have defeated Lich King already. Those are the guilds these encounters were made for and they are the ones who can judge the difficulty of these encounters accurately.</div></div><hr />

Dear Phasmy. Go back to school. While there, learn to read. After you learn to read, you can learn a little bit about statistics, how to interpret them, and how to ask questions of statistics in a meaningful manner.<br />
<br />
Until then, don't shoot off your mouth, because those of us who actually paid attention in our stats classes (many, many, many. more than 1) think you are an idiot.</div></div><hr />

Umm, the medium mode is killing the later bosses in normal difficulty ...<br />
<br />
You are just making stuff up. If you had looked at the progression you will see it is remarkably fine grained. At almost everypoint about 50-80% as many guilds can proceed to the next boss. According to guildprogress.com only 7.8% of guilds that are 4/12 can also do 11/12. Only about 50% of guilds that do 4/12 can make the jump to 5/12. From then on the progression is almost a perfect 80% of guilds progressing to each additional boss. From then on it proceeds like that almost all the way up to sindragosa, with 50-80% of guilds making it to each additional boss. <br />
<br />
In fact (if you ignore gunship battle) there are only three data points in the entire progression from Saurfang normal through to sindragosa heroic where the rate of progression from one boss to the next is outside the 50-80% range. The first is Festergut to Rotface with over 90% of guilds able to do one doing the other and the other two are Valithra-&gt;Sindragosa normal and Sindragosa-&gt;Arthas normal with only 20-30% of guilds who can reach one step able to make the next one. This is incredibly fine grained progression, the exact kind of logarithmic procression you are crying that the game should have.<br />
<br />
There isn't a single point in the data where a guild that can do one boss can just faceroll the next two or three. You are just making that up because, having obviously not looked at the data at all you somehow suspect that to be true. You need to learn to differentiate between stuff you imagine (your post) and reality (what the numbers bear out) and stop posting the former as if it is the latter.<br />
<br />
Yours must be the kind of post that is absolutely heartbreaking for the encounter designers at Blizzard. They create a fantastically balanced instance with an almost perfect difficulty gradient from boss to boss and yet you turn around and berate them as if they had failed to do so.</div></div><hr />

What restrictions were placed on players to prevent them attempting Alone in the Darkness as many times as they wanted to?<br />
<br />
To me, Ulduar is an example of how raid instances should be done (without the Algalon restrictions). Yogg+0 was hard enough to make guilds take a hell of a long time to kill him to the point where many guilds were in a state of shock when Stars finally took him down. This is how end-of-raid bosses should be and, without a doubt, definitely how end-of-expansion bosses should be.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're a fucking moron if you can't tell the difference between NORMAL MODE bosses and HARD MODE END OF TIER bosses.<br />
<br />
How long did it take people to down Yogg+4? How long did it take the best of the best to down Gruul/Magtheridon/Prince/Kael'Thas/Illidan/Archimonde/KJ? Oh yea, no time at all. Why aren't you complaining that Yogg+4 should have destroyed top 100 guilds without needing limited attempts to do so?<br />
<br />
LK normal mode is supposed to be doable by a wide range of guilds, and that's awesome, because that means every server has a chance to kill him.<br />
<br />
My server hasn't downed LK yet, and only 1 guild has downed Sindragosa. I highly doubt you're even that progressed, you just like to bitch and blame the people around you for your personal failures.<br />
<br />
If only 1% of 1% of 1% of all serious raiding guilds out there can clear an easy-mode raid, how do you expect the game to survive?</div></div><hr />

I'd like to point out that the Holy Grail of most of these whiners, Black Temple/Mount Hyjal, had the exact opposite layout.<br />
<br />
Because of the mechanics of &quot;Attunements,&quot; it was Blizz's philosophy to reward guilds that could manage to kill Vashj/Kael (back when the previous tier wasn't immediately forgotten when the next tier came out) with easy as fuck bosses up until most of the way through the instance.<br />
<br />
The first 4 bosses of BT were 1 or 2 shots for us, and getting 5/9 was just a manner of finding out that we should go kill the easy boss instead of choosing to go to the harder one first.<br />
<br />
The first 2 bosses in Hyjal (especially the first) were laughable, and 4/5 happened the 2nd week, almost as soon as we got the trash down.<br />
<br />
The rest of the bosses were actually bosses, but most of them were absolute loot bags, simple rewards for killing the end bosses of the last tier. It was the same way with Loot Reaver and most of the rest of TK (besides Kael'Thas, before his setbacks). After meeting the resist requirements for Hydross, most of the rest of SSC falls into place as well (we beat him the right way barely before they nerfed him, and stomped the next 3 bosses, reaching Vashj fairly quickly after that).</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the way, the next day after they released the video 3 other guilds killed him. Coincidence? But seriously, I'm really glad hes that hard (only 8 guilds downed him) and I'm super glad that LK is still standing.</div></div><hr />

Even on normal mode, this boss should have obliterated top-100 guilds for the first week of release and not needed limited attempts in order to do so. With or without bugs this boss should have crushed them, and it didn't.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I assume you understand that the best guilds in the world are not just a little bit better than 'the rest of us' , but many hundreds of times better?<br />
<br />
They're really good. The only way to have any boss 'obliterate' them for long is to have him be literally impossible, and I'm not sure I see how that makes for a particularly interesting Race.</div></div><hr />
