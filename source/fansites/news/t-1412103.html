Patch 5.4 Hotfixes - December 2<br />
Creatures<br />
<br />
The Celestials (Chi-Ji, Niuzao, Xuen, and Yu'lon) have their health reduced to 25% of original health. If more than 10 players from the same faction are engaged with the Celestial, their health will scale up. The health increase will cap at 100% of their original health with 40 players.<br />

CC in Warlords of Draenor<br />
We are planning to take a strong look at CC in Warlords with the intent of dialing things back a little. We do think it's important that players are rewarded for using CC intelligently (by coordinating usage, being mindful of diminishing returns, etc), but we think we can approach things in a way that allows us to tone down CC overall while still providing that gameplay. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/282735-will-warlords-reduce-the-amount-of-cc/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10717442112?page=4#62))<br />
<br />
Daze Effect<br />
Oh man! Remember when it was based on Defense so tanks could essentially run anywhere and never get dazed but us cloth wearers would be in dazed-city? Crazy. Although they had to pay more repairs back then too. XD<br />
<br />
Don't hear too much about it these days though, kind of a fun discussion to have again! In-general the world should be dangerous, and when you can ride through it unaffected, or have guaranteed escapes, it loses some of that danger. It's a lot of the same reasoning for non-flying in new content. Sure, you can still escape many situations, and there are still some get-out-of-jail-free cards, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea to remove all of the situations which cause you to be cautious, plan travel routes, and have to play your character in this Roleplaying Game. We think the daze mechanic still serves its useful purpose.

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png Connected Realms Update<br />
As previously announced, we’ve been working toward connecting realms to increase the number of players on low-population realms, and since then have completed several connections. <br />
<br />
Future Connections<br />
We do not have a date for the following realm connections, but will update this blog post when we do.<br />
<br />
Next ​​Batch<br />
<br />
Andorhal and Ursin<br />
Crushridge and Anub'arak/Chromaggus/Garithos/Nathrezim/Smolderthorn<br />
Icecrown and Malygos<br />
Quel'dorei and Sen'jin<br />
<br />
<br />
​Plans for these connections may change at any time, but we’ll provide additional updates on specific dates for future connections here as we can. Please note that as a part of the connection process realm times may change to match each other.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Professions<br />
Also if sockets that uncommon do you have plans to rebalance profession perks or just ignore for another expansion?<br />
I'd like to cut them TBH. Not sure we can pull that off. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405463712347078656))<br />
<br />
I can't remember...were professions discussed with the instant 90s?<br />
We likely need some solution, but aren't crazy about just &quot;choose which prof you want at max.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403952590204833792))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Why are there no female Warlords of Draenor? You couldn't have come up with a single one?<br />
Their identities already established in the lore. We could have replaced one, but that might have felt transparent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401046106152251392))<br />
<br />
&quot;Gameplay trumps lore.&quot; &quot;We want to let you play with friends.&quot; So when can my gnome play with my RealID friend's blood elf?<br />
Having two factions also produces good gameplay. It was a conscious decision not dictated by lore. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401043121384853504))<br />
<br />
so we got suspended from Heroes to Soldiers again. Feels wrong! Do you think about Lore when you make such Decisions?<br />
We are crafting the story so hopefully you feel like heroes. That is why you are asked to return to the dark portal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402535736651419648))<br />
That is why you command the garrison. If being heroic meant you could not be threatened, the game would be boring. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402535832772280320))<br />
<br />
UI / Addons<br />
This is NOT a full group finder system. These are some moderate updates to the current system that people may find useful.<br />
Takes our crappy old raid browser and enables some cross realm functionality. Still doing a new Group Finder for 6.0. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403632954120736768))<br />
To be fair, it needs to be a LFM and not LFG thus the need for oqueue. Hopefully blizzard realizes this<br />
Random matchmaking and pug forming are two different and valuable features with different audiences. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403952859902799873))<br />

Poll: Profession Perks<br />
Taking a look at one of the more interesting tweets we saw today, Ghostcrawler suggested the removal of profession perks. What would you like to see change (if anything) with profession perks in Warlords? Share your thoughts and suggest more poll options or new profession perks in the comments.<br />
<br />
Yesterday we revisited a poll (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3398-SoO-Progression-Heroic-Norushen-Changes-Blue-Tweets-Poll-PvE-Content-Fan-Art) about the best world PvE content after many people suggested that the allure of Timeless Isle would wear off in a month or two, but it looks like the results are almost the same (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3608-Armory-Stats-Player-Raid-Completion-Blue-Tweets-Poll-World-PvE-Content-Fan-Art) yet again. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bladeface</div><div class="date">2013-12-03, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO they should replace profession perks with ones that give no direct combat benefit, but perhaps make things a little easier on them? Like for alchemy you would get a bottomless flask that gives same stats as the current crafted ones or maybe you can choose between that and a bottomless potion of your choice(some how make them mutually exclusive so you can't have both endless flask and potion or endless of multiple potions). For enchanters maybe make enchants used on yourself use less materials or have more options(say instead of only hste or mastery for gloves you could also choose crit or intellect as a caster). I only have those 2 professions on characters that I actually play so I don't know what would be good for the other ones but maybe something along the lines of the crafted gear from bc that you could only wear if you are that profession(say, a version of the boe gear you get recipes for from raids thats very cheap to make but can't be disenchanted or sold)</div></div><hr />

...be more coherent. Maybe then people know what you're on about.<br />
<br />
Also, WoW isn't dying. Bosses have been solo'ed since Vanilla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BUT, I'd like to see them disabled (sockets don't confer gem bonuses, racial powers don't activate, ring enchants disabled, etc) in BGs and Arenas. Let the PvP folks play on a field solely determined by their class and gear rather than also their profession and race.</div></div><hr />

My Priest has always been a Tailor/Enchanter. I burn through tons of Eternium thread changing my cloak from Lightweave to Darkweave (even when I heal all night it's worth changing for some bosses). It's part of her identity and a fun way to change up regen/throughput on a perboss basis without having a lot of gear swaps. We're already losing Reforging, now this too? They are taking away customization instead of adding it :( RPG?</div></div><hr />

Any time you can line up a short burst of stats with a major CD, that perk is going to pull ahead. Static perks are fine, and easy to balance.

<br />
Doom Lord Kazzak and Doomwalker haven't been spawning for a long long time. I feel bad that those world bosses don't spawn as often as the ones in MoP and next expansion. Could we expect to see their spawn timer reduced so we can just have fun and improvise? (By the way, the Dungeon Journal for pre-cata isn't in yet, but when they add them in, they should have those world bosses in there to be kept more lively like the rest.) It's a suggestion that came up. Also, awesome solo vid.</div></div><hr />

I mean, I dont mind losing my synapse springs, but I refuse to lose my glider and rocket boots. Or Jeeves. Or the mailbox. Or my loot-a-rang. Or wormhole generators. <br />
<br />
You know, take away the glove enchant and professions should have the same style of perks as Engineering.</div></div><hr />

Remove any combat related buff from proffs and racials or make them completely equal.<br />

<br />
The hardest thing in this is dealing with the smaller golems quickly, then nuking down Animus before the enrage. Due to soloing as a melee you completely ignore most of the mechanics (Jolt - can't be interupted so you just take moderate damage, Font - no other players to damage, Matter Transfer - no other players to switch with, plus no Massive Golems are active, Crimson Wake - no Large Golems are active).<br />
<br />
Thus all you need to do once all the active Small Golems are down (the hardest part) all you need to do is soak the Jolt damage, Mark DoT and heavy melee swings from the Animus itself while stepping out of the Ring whenever it spawns. Toward the end you might have to deal with Full Power, taking reasonably heavy hits (which can mostly be soaked with AMS and other cooldowns).<br />
<br />
Mostly its a DPS race. Once the small adds are down. Which is literally the hardest thing. Still good, but not as complex as some other solo fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually think MoP quests did a decent job of referring to you as a Hero. Possibly Cata and to a lesser extent Wotlk too, but can't remember that clearly. But when NPCs refered to you they often seemed aware of the campaigns you'd (probably) have been involved in. It didn't change the actual gameplay, but was at least some recognition of what you'd done. Of course, if you'd have to read the quest text to see that...<br />
<br />
I'd be glad to see Proffession quests go. I'm quite lazy, I only level the damn things for the bonuses.</div></div><hr />

What? He killed one of the small golems which already had his anima and that anima jumped into another small golem which had no anima yet. That's why boss never reached 100 anima and his soft enrage mechanic. That has to be done in a split second. GO ahead and try yourself ain't no easy job, mon.</div></div><hr />

I like how they talk about danger in the same context as daze. Sure, this would be true if the mobs were actually dangerous...<br />
They removed virtually all elite camps or elite patrols in the world a long time ago. Mobs die from the press of a couple of buttons except maybe at day 1 and if they outlevel you. Even if you're close to dying, escaping them is so easy that the only thing that will ever kill you is your own laziness.<br />
<br />
I don't mind daze at all, but they should friggin stop using the word dangerous together with it. It's pathetic.</div></div><hr />

Make them use hard to get materials, difficult combinations (high failure rate when combining stuff), maybe a daily cooldown on some components, drops from challenging solo content (mobs, quests, 'wave 30 proving grounds'), etc., but make my profession useful to ME! It's nice that you can get rich with certain professions, but I don't care about that, I want it to mean something to ME.<br />

And for the love of all that is holy, stop putting endgame recipes in raids! Professions are a solo endeavour, don't make me raid just to compete. I'd rather have a 0,1% drop in the world then a 100% drop in a raid.</div></div><hr />

Never said it was easy. I'm just saying that most of the mechanics are completely ignored. Which you're not denying.<br />

Its like the time he claimed Rotface was easy and thus ICC was a joke. Despite, you know, not getting anywhere near to beating the enrage and having literally zero mechanics other then 'melee swing' to deal with. Its just not all that impressive compared to Sarth 3D or Lich King.</div></div><hr />

Imo professions should be a way to make gold AND mitigate some RNG in drops at the cost of some gold (fight the gold sellers not the game itself). Everything a profession does should be able to be traded, but some stuf would make items souldbound (in person trading)<br />
<br />
Professions like Tailoring, Leatherworking and Blacksmithing should be able to craft awesome gear again, even some BiS with a bit of luck (random tertiary stats and sokets ala diablo style) and reward the crafter with a ton of gold that one time he was lucky enough.<br />
Enchanting should be the main provider of wands in the game (yes I miss wands... A LOT)<br />
Jewelcrafting and inscription should provide off hands.<br />
<br />
Big powerfull weapons should need a Blacksmith to craft the main weapon, then you should have to take it to an Incriptioner to make it better, then to a Jewelcrafter, and finaly to an enchanter just to finish the weapon!<br />

Yup, I too had to switch from my trusty enchanting to engineer on my warlock for the same reason. It's stupid, but at the same time, if they touch my engineering perks (glider, and so on), I'd be sad. :( Would be nice if all professions had something nice like that.<br />

Imo they should have always just been improve your skill to make stuff, maybe give additional properties to items, make the cast time faster when queuing multiple items or as was said earlier, kept the specializations and make really cool specific stuff. <br />
<br />
The world firsts and server firsts and what not have always been skewed, cuz everyone just picks the best profession combo and race with the best perks to your class, and if you don't then you pretty much are at a disadvantage.<br />
<br />
If they remove the perks we have now, i'd be ok with that. However I'd like them to add new perks that are more in tune to the professions, and new ways to approach the issue, then just strip them all, making professions even more boring and plain. Pretty soon it will get to get to the point just remove professions all together, or strip them down to only make a few items of worth each patch/expansion, rest can be discarded and gutted, its sad that 98% of every profession is worthless old content, even when leveling in a new expansion.<br />
<br />
If anything, for a profession thing give us a choice on what bonus we want, would it be so hard to make some cool bonuses, but then say you choose leatherworking, you then can choose what bonus you want to use (again with no combat advantage) then you could take any profession that you want, not dictated by a certain perk, and everyone wins!<br />

Yeah, its pretty damn simple actually, you get the option to craft your own gear to use or sale, and that's all you need from having a profession. Combat stat perks came after TBC when they axed the tiered crafting system (which was much better btw, save for the reliance on raids to finish the best versions). Don't really see the point of your pathetic whinging honestly, unless you actually hate having improved crafting systems that would come at the cost of the boring stat perks.</div></div><hr />

Make them more powerful, but disable them in BGs/Raids (maybe not unrated BGs). This way you can have your fun with your perk without having to worry so much about mix/maxing (If you are min/maxing outside instance stuff, you probably have 2 gathering professions).<br />

<br />
As regards to instant 90 professions, I guess if they rework the professions to be easy to level up to that point anyway like mining, herb, arc and cooking in MoP, I think it would be fine to have them instant level to 600, but if they kept them as they are, I think they should maybe only jump up to 450 or 500. - In reality, as long as one profession isn't giving a massive edge over others, therefore everyone going for it on an instant 90 alt, it actually really doesn't matter if they get to choose two profs to jump to 600.<br />
<br />
Balance is everything really.<br />
<br />
The could also rework to them to give a actual profession bonus, but professions need reworked for that, they need to be more indepth and offer much more, it's a very very basic system with only a few real avenues to explore at max level, adding mounts to various professions was a good step, and adding plans in 5.4, but they need to go further.</div></div><hr />

The end of this statement is as much disappointing as its beginning was appealing. Why can't we have CC oriented PvE content? What's wrong with the instances as they were in TBC, WotLK and Cata? Don't care if you remove totally CC in PvP, but keep them in PvE, please.<br />

I agree, they're removing the game's depth little by little. They've ditched the RPG part and are turning it into a 3rd person action game, they just don't have the balls to come out and say so. Basically catering to the CoD fanbase's demand for instant gratification. RPGs are about building up your character over time, experimenting with and mastering a wide range of different abilities. It seems Blizz is almost shooting for an FPS approach- create an account, log in and queue for a match and you're ready to go! Don't want to fine-tune abilites, refine your character, master a playstyle or learn a class? Don't worry, it's not necessary, just log in and learn your three attacks and you're good to go! They've pretty much wrecked their own genre. I have a character that's 7 years old, and I have zero reasons to log in and play him over one that I made 3 weeks ago. It's not like I've been able to use that time to master the class; it plays completely differently than when I rolled it.<br />
<br />
I've said it before: people like quick and easy, but they don't respect it, and if Blizzard keeps this up there'll be very little personal player &quot;investment&quot; in its game or characters. Easy come, easy go.</div></div><hr />

My Priest has always been a Tailor/Enchanter. I burn through tons of Eternium thread changing my cloak from Lightweave to Darkweave (even when I heal all night it's worth changing for some bosses). It's part of her identity and a fun way to change up regen/throughput on a perboss basis without having a lot of gear swaps. We're already losing Reforging, now this too? They are taking away customization instead of adding it :( RPG?<br />
<br />
I don't care what people say, I want to play a RPG, not log on and pick a person with the same gear and everything else as everyone else has. I have worked years to develop my character, little by little things are being simplified to the point that she is becoming the same as all other characters. I worked for ever to getting skilled in all weapons, taken away, animals that were rare and hard to get, to set you apart have been made avalible for anyone to get, each spec plays so similar why bother, nerfing the time for noobs to leave makes it to were they do not know there toon and suck playing it too. Re-balance maybe, but leave some depth to this game. If you don't want to work hard on your character and make it your own, if you just want to log on and pick then go... I think you should go play some other game not RPG, then you don't have to work hard. I just want to play the game I love not some simplified, like every other game. LEAVE DEPTH<br />

I also really like the mounts you can make. I wouldn't mind Blizzard giving us more cosmetic, fun perks, or making the existing ones stronger. I think if they completely removed them they'd be taking the easy way out. If there are no cosmetic improvements, if there are no PvE incentives, why even bother with professions? <br />
<br />
In my opinion, professions add an extra depth and uniqueness to a character too - because you can pick and choose which perks you want - which is what I thought Blizzard was going for.</div></div><hr />

I find it odd that Blizzard goes out of their way to make this game nothing but combat oriented. They wonder why they are losing so many subs it is because there is nothing to do but fight. Sometimes people want meaningful gameplay that isn't all about killing someone. No Blizzard, pet battles turned out to be a joke since you know, there is no point to them.</div></div><hr />

Oh man! Remember when it was based on Defense so tanks could essentially run anywhere and never get dazed but us cloth wearers would be in dazed-city? Crazy. Although they had to pay more repairs back then too. XD<br />
<br />
Don't hear too much about it these days though, kind of a fun discussion to have again! In-general the world should be dangerous, and when you can ride through it unaffected, or have guaranteed escapes, it loses some of that danger. It's a lot of the same reasoning for non-flying in new content. Sure, you can still escape many situations, and there are still some get-out-of-jail-free cards, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea to remove all of the situations which cause you to be cautious, plan travel routes, and have to play your character in this Roleplaying Game. We think the daze mechanic still serves its useful purpose.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, man! Hey! You guys remember that awesome time a few days ago when we were all running across Timeless Isle on our epic Triceratops mounts to race to a rare spawn and we each got repeatedly dazed off and nearly one shot by some Tauren and tigers?!?! Was that not awesome or what? Am I right, or am I right?????<br />
<br />
Look, I'm not saying take it out of the game.. but there is no reason why I should be getting dazed by nearly every mob at level 90 and either getting ambushed or having to miss out on an event because I had no choice but to take a beating and hope I lived long enough to walk away from the fight, or stay and actually fight wasting time. Some of those creatures will repeatedly daze you and not let you go. <br />
<br />
Such tedious crap! I hope Warlords of Draenor tones that down a little bit. Especially if they plan on making a similar event style leveling process. Having to fight 10 boars on your way to and from a giant orc fort isn't exactly screaming legendary!<br />
<br />
No flying, still not a fan. But dazing as bad as it is right now, at least in some areas, for 10 levels worth of content.... just not gonna cut it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point of professions sans perks is to enjoy the profession you want to have, rather than leveling one to try and min/max your character and feeling obligated to. Maybe as a raider I enjoy mining on my main since I'm out in the world traveling more on him than alts, and thus see more mining nodes? But because of the profession perks I couldn't raid and not be expected to drop it for something else. Or, as an engineer I can level it because I like the idea of having the various gadgets and gizmos. They're actively making it less of a pain in the ass to keep up with modifying an item after you get it, so it makes sense that you wouldn't have to add another socket, or socket another serpent's eye, or put a new embroidery on your cloak, etc. etc. etc. What you consider as being &quot;worse&quot; is benefiting the majority of players by removing the barrier of expectations from other players.<br />
<br />
<br />
After additional reading, it would also seem that players don't understand in what context Blizzard refers to perks: These are the character-only item modifications that all tend to equal out very closely regardless of your class. Cloak Embroideries for Tailoring, Extra socket from Blacksmithing, Additional bracer enchant from Leatherworking, the additional effect from Alchemy elixirs etc., Super shoulder enchants from Inscription, the super gems from Jewelcrafting, etc.</div></div><hr />

- Engineering retains 'gadgets and gizmos' for out in the world, but loses major 'rocket boot' advantage which is toned down. Can still craft the original rocket boots with terrible stats for the 'fun speed boost'.

That would be far too much work for them especially with Dk's, they already nerfed self healing in pvp why does it matter if this enables some classes to solo old content as long as it's balanced at current level content.

I sure hope the new expansion won't aim to get boring from the start, although it looks that way with the removal of reforging and the oversimplification of stats probably killing theorycrafting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People will just not bother doing anything with there professions <br />

Blizzard are to bust catering for players that don't give a shit and cant really be bothered to play the game (removing hit caps etc, reforging less gems and enchants on gear and no meta gems)<br />

HAHAHAHAHA. No, no it doesn't. There are other mmo's who allow factions to play with each other.

Both factions are constantly teaming up to take out some big bad. It's pathetic this limitation is still in the game.<br />

Then go play those games. I know Rift made that choice, but because they were losing subs, not because it was a good choice.<br />

Except, &quot;the majority&quot; of players don't raid, and don't min/max and aren't in a progression guild.... so I think you're wrong. 20% of people didn't even raid Sha right? Only 1% of players supposedly raid, right? So min/maxxing with profs isn't something a majority of people do. You don't need to do it for LFR.</div></div><hr />

I think the perks from professions should be taken a good look at, because this whole idea of having to feel obligated to level a profession for bonus stats (i.e., ring enchant perks from enchanting) is an unnecessary, not-so-fun feature. <br />
<br />
Back in vanilla and TBC, before profession perks were added, I remember grabbing mining and engineering because I liked their synergy. Today, I feel obligated to drop my mining (+480 stam, really?) for enchanting because of that darn ring enchant perk. I say remove perks entirely or rework the feature.</div></div><hr />
