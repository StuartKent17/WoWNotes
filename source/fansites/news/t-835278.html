Lady Sinestra 25 Heroic World First Kill by Paragon 
That's it, Paragon defeated Lady Sinestra, the heroic-only boss of the Bastion of Twilight a few seconds ago. Only Al'akir remains undefeated but it could be pretty fast now that the Sinestra first kill is out of the picture.

<br />
Statement from Paragon (http://www.paragon-wow.com/)<br />
We have just managed to kill Sinestra 25-man in heroic mode. We reached the boss as the second guild in the world. <br />
<br />
The encounter itself was quite unfinished, especially on the first few days. There were some absolutely massive bugs that were obvious from the first pull; Shadow Orbs sweeping the whole room and killing everyone in the raid. The Dark Simulacrum (and other reflects) &amp; Wrack was probably the biggest one. You could literally hit the boss for 1 billion damage with a single GCD - it was pretty damn scary watching Sinestra almost die to it by accident. Blizzard however fixed this within an hour or two after receiving the report.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/january/Simulacrum.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/january/Simulacrum.jpg)<br />
Luckily this was hotfixed right away by Blizzard<br />
<br />
There were still a bunch of hotfixes even between attempts; a tactic that could be used to handle a part of the fight wouldn’t just simply work at all on the next and just left us scratching our head. At these points, we often took theorycrafting breaks even up to an hour before figuring out what exactly we’re supposed to do next. Some people got pretty upset after the first sub-10% attempt, finding out that the tactic we used was unintended and hotfixed right afterwards.<br />
<br />
Overall just a very weird raiding experience. Some good stuff, some bad stuff, some unfinished/buggy stuff, but definitely very stressful. Personally I’m not sure what to think of it quite yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
All in all, this tier of raiding in my opinion has been the hardest tier of raiding overall. There haven’t been many pushover bosses on Heroic difficulty, there hasn’t been any gating, there haven’t been any attunements and such - it has just been one big absolutely brutal grind.<br />
<br />
Probably the biggest difference between this tier and the previous ones have been the various bugs and exploits, sadly enough. There are also a lot of completely baseless rumours going around of us exploiting various bosses. Even some top guilds have made some pretty sad and misinformed comments based on nothing but hearsay and quotes from forum trolls, who have absolutely no first-hand knowledge at all.<br />
<br />
We didn’t use any exploits/bugs whatsoever on Cho’gall. We didn’t use them on Nefarian. We didn’t use them on Sinestra. I’m not sure what all bosses there are even rumours about anymore, it’s hard to keep track of with the amount of trolls absolutely exploding everywhere.<br />
<br />
It will all be completely obvious once we have time to get the videos done.<br />

<br />
yes its situational<br />
but wen you happen to be in the right situation........ its total win<br />
<br />
and before you say it, there are huge dmg opportunities for it outside specific raid situations<br />
you just have to be a lil bit devious and think about it for a bit<br />
then not go and tell the whole world how its done, otherwise it gets hotfixed, comprende<br />
<br />
less qq, more pewpew<br />
<br />
From DK forums. Just sayin', might have been fixed in the hotfixes to Sinestra though.</div></div><hr />

Paragons just so false but so many wont see trough their cover... sad thing<br />
no gz at all<br />
<br />
this is total bullshit, and shows how short you have been playing.<br />
if its possible in game and works is shouldnt be called cheating/bugg abuse. <br />
<br />
the fact that ppl and even blizz now a days tells/shows one tactic doesnt mean it the right one the fastest one or even the best or most effecient one.<br />
<br />
remember when mmo-c was non excisting and wowhead was called thottbot... there wernt many guides (thank god, guides kill wow and make bad players look good)... and you found out your guild tactics by endless whipping, there was no right or wrong tactic there was looting or wiping. if (because no one knows) they used some sort of trick, its clever use of mechanics and game understanding and lack of blizz for not closing it off if they didnt want it to happen.<br />
<br />
dont hate the player hate the game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noogie</div><div class="date">2011-01-20, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paid to play...<br />
<br />
They may get kickback but not much and certainly not enough to stay jobless. How often do they mention their sponsors in their world first kills? Cause a real sponsor that pays for everything would REQUIRE it. Sponsorship really just means they get free peripherals and airfare to events are taken care of, perhaps the officer core get a little more but nothing like what people assume.<br />
<br />
Do ignorant people believe that the sponsors pay full time salaries for (just a number here) 70 raiders in Paragon? That anyone who joins the guild immediately is on the payroll and doesn't have to have a job? That's absurd. Having had sponsorship in FPS games years ago, it just doesn't work like that. MMO games barely have events (in raiding) that can really benefit a sponsor and website banners don't really make enough money to warrant giving a lot of money to people who have little to no public exposure. <br />
<br />
If they make money, which i doubt 95% of Paragon do (if that), it's certainly not something to be impressed by. You probably make more then they do on a day to day basis. The assertion that playing competitively is so easy and care free that you get paid to play is stupid. They devote far much more time then you think they do and they pay the dime on it and sacrifice a lot of stuff in their lives to do so. The only caveat here is that they only do it for a month or so every 6 months and then they go back to normality whilst they farm that content.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love what Paragon does and I enjoy watching their progression. Though to discount what they did because they 'get paid to do it' is just ignorant and short sighted.</div></div><hr />

(Am I reading this right on wowprogress? only 6 heroic kills for the top 10-man raids?)<br />
10's are not in any way tuned to reflect the smaller roster size of the usual guild performing theses raids thus it is nearly impossible for them to keep the same pace as 25 man raid guilds.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, but it's fine - me and Mancheese both tried it. To be honest it was pretty damn scary to watch the boss almost die.<br />

<br />
Oh please. I can safely assume you're not even close to Sinestra. What Paragon does isn't a reflection of what the average guild will do. They are on the top of their game and are sponsored for this stuff, this is entry level content and they obviously did have the luxury to stack the raid in whatever configuration they need (which 99% of guilds do not have the ability to do). There's no need to pretend like the world is ending because the best guild in the world killed it fast.<br />
<br />
Grats to Paragon.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zoma</div><div class="date">2011-01-20, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So apparently the 'exploit' was Dark Simulacrum, an ability that is intended to copy an enemies cast. Some abilities are immune to this. Blizzard chose not to make Sinestra's spell(s) immune, therefore, it must be legal.<br />
<br />
Then I guess they exploited it by class stacking again... except they only had 2 Death Knights, the users of Dark Simulacrum.<br />
<br />
I didn't have a problem with them using 11 ferals to stack big numbers, but are those of you whining trying to tell me that having 2 of a class in a 25 man raid is exploiting, too?<br />

People just throwing about accusations like that on the comments on the front page just looks bad, Paragon have already come on the site once to defend themselves and now it's happening again. They're obviously trolls and aren't in any way contributing to the thread/post/whatever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could not agree more. I've been reading all the posts and im not one to throw stones but please guys, look back on other world firsts like Lich King with the frag bomb exploit and such. Blizzard was so proud to talk big about this fight and then it drops dead this fast.... I mean even KJ took longer in TBC. Something is wrong here and that's all i will speculate on right now.<br />

<br />
Either way, first kill is a first kill unless Blizzard steps in and squashes it. Until they do, huge congrats to Paragon and best of luck on Al'Akir! <br />
<br />
I have to say... this expansions opening race for World Firsts may have been &quot;quick&quot; in the grand scheme of things, but compared to WotLK and Naxx v2.0, it's been far less disappointing. <br />
<br />
Again, congrats to all involved on the kill.</div></div><hr />

So GG for beating the encounter before Blizz had a change to tune it correctly, u can haz a cookie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If i was a raid leader and one class/spec was doing more dps on an enconter i would stack that class/spec and bring 1 of the others to buff them. We talking about world first. If ranged classes had an easy go on a fight i would say fuck melles this wek lets get world first bring more ranged.</div></div><hr />

I don't know the fight myself but I'm guessing its prolly a mixture of well known mechanics merged together in a way that may be difficult at first but after numerous tries im sure they figured it out. <br />
<br />
This is probably true for most top guilds out there and unless a boss is super overtuned (which most people expectan end-game raiding boss should be) as to the point you need to be decked in bis in order to kill even if they execute perfectly(aka gear cockblock), the boss will go down relatively quick.</div></div><hr />

Any comments from For the Horde ?<br />
Is it okay if Boub posts this world first or would you like him to wait until you kill her too, sometime next year ?<br />

@ Kassieds lol warriors look how many shamans they took of any spec..... 0 without hero being shaman only (i do like this change so no flaming) shamans have become a worthless class because they cant out dps most of those classes and healing they may be able to match that healing but, i would rather have a oally healer then a shaman, a pally can heal three at the same time with one heal. + they have good aoe heals now</div></div><hr />

Quote for Truth!!!!<br />
<br />
And Blizzard are haggling whether Retribution DPS &quot;could be too low&quot;. The balance, or lack of, as shown by what has to be some of the best players on the planet here is sickening. Granted, I know shit about the fight, but I doubt the Retri is playing cleanse bot.<br />

I personally fail to see why the world needs to hear that Paragon did this. To them and their peers, followers, and friends, this is an achievement, but to showcase it to the world as news shows MMO-Champion is desperate for a &quot;story&quot;, and is also totally unnecessary.<br />
<br />
The fuck are you talking about?<br />
<br />
A lot of people care about this, as you can already tell. It's entertaining, and amusing. Plus, MMO has always been showing world first kills. Hell, I remember Hydross years and years ago.</div></div><hr />

Paragon killed it fast, that doesn't mean YOU could.</div></div><hr />

This makes me sad :(<br />
<br />
Yeah umm didn't you hear? shaman's bring nothing to the table anymore so why bring them obviously. <br />
<br />
Joking aside and before you can spew bring the player not the class, it's pretty damn obvious which &quot;players&quot; are required for optimum raid comp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give it up! One guild has killed Sinestra. One single guild. Al'akir heroic is still up. We're a month and a half into the expansion and we're just now seeing the first kills on the last raid bosses. Some of which people were able to practice during beta.<br />
<br />
If I recall correctly, the entire first tier of WotLK raiding was cleared within the first weekend after launch.</div></div><hr />

We're all just disappointed LD went down so fast coupled with the Nef kill by Paragon which left a bad taste already it's logical to assume ppl will be cynical bout this. Just saying. You ppl just come over as fanboys just cuz someone says something you don't like. Hopefully ala'kir will prove much more a hassle.</div></div><hr />

News is what people decide. Judging by the huge number of replies to this &quot;news&quot; in such a short time, I think it not your place to dispute this piece as newsworthy or not, lest you ignore what the demographic that look at your site are interested in.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what can be considered more newsworthy than a &quot;world first&quot; to be honest, I mean, if you look at news in a more serious and dedicated environment, you'll see that a lot of it is about firsts and breakthroughs and general achievements.</div></div><hr />

Woah bro, rage more why don't you. I never said that no one cared, literacy is nice to have. What I DID say is that I fail to see why this is front page news. Honorable mention or something, fine, maybe a simple link to Paragons website along with a news post, but to dedicate a whole post? That's all I was saying.<br />
<br />
Seriously man, I didn't write THAT much, did I really need to TL;DR it for you?<br />
<br />
EDIT: @ Nisala: Again. I'm not debating this isn't news, but I am saying I find it silly this needs a whole post. This is a video game. I care more about improving my own play, than hearing about somebody elses, but that's just me. That's why I look at Paragon, give a slight nod and smile, and move on. I'm just stating an opinion, not fact. So why do you assume I'm taking it as the latter? Is this not a forum?</div></div><hr />

I gave you the reason, idiot.<br />
<br />
Reason 1: A lot of people care.<br />
Reason 2: They find it entertaining.<br />
Reason 3: They also find it amusing<br />
Reason 4: It's always been a standard here.<br />
<br />
What were you saying about literacy?<br />
<br />
And lul, that wasn't raging. One curse word, HOLY SHIT</div></div><hr />

For a lot of people this is big news, worthy of a front page mention. Maybe not to you, but opinions are like assholes...</div></div><hr />
