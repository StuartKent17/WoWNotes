​This week will see some changes coming to the Elegon encounter in Heroic mode Mogu’shan Vaults. The Discharge (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/118299) effect that occurs whenever an Energy Charge (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/60913) is defeated was not dealing damage in Heroic mode, which had the effect of making a portion of the fight easier than it should be. Since a few guilds had already beaten Heroic mode Elegon before we were able to apply a hotfix to the issue, we chose to hold off on resolving this issue until now to keep the field even during the first week of Heroic progression. In addition to the fix to Discharge, Elegon’s health will also be reduced to offset the loss of Draw Power (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/124967) stacks resulting from the Discharge resolution. <br />
<br />
The following fixes will be in place when raids reset this week in each region:<br />
Discharge (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/118299) now properly deals damage in Heroic difficulty. Elegon’s health has been reduced by approximately 12.5% on Heroic difficulty.​</div></div><hr />

Leat, did you even have time to read the patch notes before commenting?<br />
<br />
Personally, this is a great fix!<br />
I know that this was troubling a lot of guilds!</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but guilds are going to get upwards of 4-6 less stacks of the buff total. Which means the last phase is gonna get 20-30% less damage done. So really, the HP nerf is absolutely necessary since even before this buff/nerf guilds were hitting the Enrage.<br />
<br />
Blizzard went about fixing this mechanic the best they possibly could have. Buff one part of the fight, nerf another to keep the difficulty on par with what it was.</div></div><hr />

Overall, I think Blizz probably made the right moves with this, although you have to wonder how a bug this significant makes it live =(</div></div><hr />

Dude Cloud serpent isnt even that hard. i completed that crap last sunday with just dailies and 2-3 eggs a day (EASY to find in 2-3 trips round the area.)<br />
<br />
Bring on the challange. My guild wont need some cheezy cheat strategy or bugged encounter to complete this.<br />
<br />
(on another note: people cry when things are bug fixed and become harder... they cry when things are made easier.... is there seriously something the wow community wont cry about? honestly? im pretty sure if they said &quot;here, here's a free month of playtime for everyone. someone would be crying about it.)<br />

To be honest, they could've left the health and just added in discharge.<br />
<br />
Adding in discharge will literally give my group another 1-2 wave clears.</div></div><hr />

What about the onyx eggs? Your just doing it wrong. I was getting plenty at night after the &quot;nerf&quot; that they supposedly made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this new mechanic called vengeance. It allows tanks to more than quadruple their dps when they take damage, ie the sparks. Comparing our tank damage on normal to heroic, a single dragon cry on normal was more damage than 6 waves combined on heroic. Our dk tank found the same thing. <br />
<br />
For my guild it was a double nerf</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guilds who kill heroic Elegon are miles ahead of the enrage anyway (like at least 20-30 seconds on 25m, and like a minute or two on 10m).<br />
<br />
I guess you can now bring 8/25 or 4/10 healers for this fight? /shrug.</div></div><hr />

Tanks included - even healers, if they had some mana-free dps talents. It might not be a big loss for everyone, but it's still there and it adds up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having 3 seconds of DPS time between spark waves is by no means comparable to pushing an additional 2 waves.<br />
<br />
Sparks explode for a tiny bit more damage than normal mode, and our healers didn't even come close to struggling in normal mode to keep up the sparks.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the sparks have more health in heroic, so they have more time to heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They want to keep the field clear and at the same difficulty from here on out. They don't want to make the fight harder then it was last week and have the ones who have already cleared it before the hotfix have it killed when other guilds that are still working on it get to face the harder version. They just realized a mechanic in the fight was bugged, so they fixed it, but instead of fixing it and making the fight harder for everyone (especially those who haven't killed it yet) they nerfed a different part of the fight to keep it the same difficulty.</div></div><hr />
