Since we broke down the six phases of content that we’ll be rolling out for Classic, we’ve heard the increase in requests for PvP details so we wanted to get you up to speed on our plans there.<br />
<br />
As was the case when World of Warcraft originally launched in 2004, there won’t be a formal PvP system in WoW Classic at the outset. You’ll still be able to PvP, of course, and there will be no Dishonorable Kills, so you’ll be free to repeatedly hunt down every player and NPC in, say, Stranglethorn Vale to your stealthy heart’s content.<br />
<br />
That’ll change once phase 2 rolls around and we add the Honor System, which will introduce Honorable Kills, Dishonorable Kills, and PvP Rank Rewards. The items you earn from the PvP Rank Rewards will be the versions from patch 1.12. Keep in mind though, just as it did originally, it will require a substantial time investment to rank up through the Honor System. For those interested in the Rank Rewards, earning epic gear will require consistent dedication over a long period of time as a top contributor on your realm. We don’t expect to see many people running around with these items early on, but we’re certain Hillsbrad Foothills will still see its fair share of action!<br />
<br />
In the third phase, we’ll introduce the first Battlegrounds: Alterac Valley (version 1.12 (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/alterac-valley-in-classic/128908)) and Warsong Gulch, alongside with their associated vendors. One thing to note is that there were a couple of updates to these vendors over the course of the original patch releases, so some items won’t be available right away. For example, the Spell Penetration trinkets available from the Warsong Gulch vendor weren’t introduced until Patch 1.9, so we’re currently thinking that we’ll add these in phase 5.<br />
<br />
The Arathi Basin Battleground will follow in phase 4, along with its specific vendor. It’ll be interesting to see how many people stay behind to guard the flag. <br />
<br />
Finally, in phase 6, we’ll have the world PvP objectives in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands, which will come out at the same time as Naxxramas.<br />
<br />
Here’s what the PvP content looks like mapped to the phases we recently posted about:<br />
<br />
Phase 1 (WoW Classic Launch)<br />
<br />
You can PvP one another in the world, but there is no tracking, and no formal rewards for doing so.<br />
<br />
Phase 2<br />
<br />
Honor System (including Dishonorable Kills)<br />
PvP Rank Rewards<br />
<br />
Phase 3<br />
<br />
Alterac Valley (version 1.12)<br />
Warsong Gulch<br />
<br />
Phase 4<br />
<br />
Arathi Basin<br />
<br />
Phase 6<br />
<br />
World PvP objectives in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands<br />
<br />
<br />
As we mentioned before, we haven’t yet determined exactly when each of the content phases (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346/1) will occur but we’ll keep you updated as they draw closer.<br />
We’re here reading what you have to say, so we wanted to thank all of you for your feedback and discussions about Classic. Keep it going!</div></div><hr />

I agree with using the 1.12 AV. I imagine the battles will still last a while since I'm pretty sure the resources weren't introduced till TBC.<br />

1.12 AV went 2 ways, a semi long fight(couple hours and horde would usually win this) but no multi day battles or Alliance rushed for frostwolf GY with a portion of the raid(warlock death ran it, i know I did this numerous times) while the rest raid was killing the mini-boss and taking the first 2 towers(not necessary). Once FW GY and the 2 towers in the horde base burned. The lock would summon the majority of the raid to the keep, you would split pull the warmasters out from drek and kill them and then go kill drek. Took 15 minutes to complete.</div></div><hr />

They can do what DBG are doing with EQ progression servers: roll out new servers every once in a while, maybe experiment with content speed or apply some other special rules.</div></div><hr />

Whatever happens I hope there's a final phase at some point with no more updates... I honestly wouldn't mind getting bis gear for every class at that point.<br />
<br />
Like if they decide to do TBC, I hope its a whole new server and just leave classic servers alone.</div></div><hr />

At some point you run out of things to do, you kind of need to have content patches. They can't let it stay there forever, eventually people will just quit. I don't think it'll work out for them to never end Vanilla.</div></div><hr />

It's a bold choice for sure, but to be fair HWL and GM require FAR more time and effort than raiding for gear given how easy pre-Naxx raids are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one is complaining that BfA isn't released with all its content at launch.<br />
<br />
The &quot;time gating&quot; in Classic is set to recreate a timeline similar to the release of the complete, non time gated patches back then. It's made with the purpose of recreating the experience and providing a better gameplay experience (by giving people time to experience things that actually required time, and that while not becoming obsolete with new patches, become more trivial).<br />
<br />
Time gating a patch's story questline that you can play through in not much more than an hour through multiple weeks (and other similar examples of time gating in recent times) is not in any way equivalent, and has zero purpose behind it other than attempting to strong-arm players into coming back. It doesn't offer any benefit in any way to any player or their gameplay.</div></div><hr />

14 weeks of timegating (HAI BROKEN SHORE) isn't the same as this.<br />

Errr .. They've communicated maybe a handful of times since they announced Classic. Communication isn't great. Meanwhile retail has had several Q&amp;As since BfA launched. <br />

<br />

Just give it until Classic is out and watch the forums fill with complaints about how bad Classic is and it's all Blizzard's fault. That's how every Blizzard release in history has been, can't imagine Classic will be any different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see a reason to worry about the honor system with no BGs only because in a more informed age a lot more people will understand max honor per hour will be to slaughter 48s as a 60. But it is also true to how vanilla was so its hard to fault them.</div></div><hr />

It’s exactly this. Quit splitting hairs because you feel jaded at the game right now. You preach non stop about how terrible time gating is and how everything needs to release all at once, but when Classic does it then it’s the right move. <br />
Please quit posting if all you can do is contradict yourself.<br />

It’s exactly this. Quit splitting hairs because you feel jaded at the game right now. You preach non stop about how terrible time gating is and how everything needs to release all at once, but when Classic does it then it’s the right move. <br />
Please quit posting if all you can do is contradict yourself.<br />

<br />
So you admit Vanilla was time gated thru release of content, then go on to say having time gating in BfA is terrible.<br />
<br />
There is no time gating, patches are being released like they used to. The last 4 bosses in MC will be available at the same day as the first 4. You're having a hard time there with your comphreension buddy</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can easily disable the PvP aspect of silithus and leave the questing.<br />
<br />
To solve the problem of people not being able to experience it as it is rolled out they can reset it every 2 years or so.</div></div><hr />

I wondered that at first, but I think it's just a typo. It is mentioned in the main post - <br />
<br />
&quot;For example, the Spell Penetration trinkets available from the Warsong Gulch vendor weren’t introduced until Patch 1.9, so we’re currently thinking that we’ll add these in phase 5.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
agreed. 1.12 basically killed AV.<br />
<br />
its also not like they can bring both versions up.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">feellucky</div><div class="date">2019-04-08, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, interesting. I'm glad they are bringing out the PVP gear rewards early on so that off-specs actually have something to work with... although it is a bit odd to include the epic gear here. Effectively this means some people will be T2.5 equivalent geared (Marshal/Warlord) before T2.0 even releases.<br />
<br />
This is my issue with the project. This isn't the original experience at all, they are copying the private server experience, which having been through both up to naxx is quite different on a private server and not in a good way. Having this pvp gear available will further trivialize the early raids, throw on the 1.12 talents and its hardly even the same game.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it will be terrible, it will still be fun but even if they released a perfect copying of classic patch by patch today it would be much easier than it was then because players are better and information is everywhere. Making things even easier will only make the problem worse. <br />
<br />
If it was up to me, I would follow the patch schedule for talents, items, and content and just keep the bug fixes from 1.12. Private servers couldn't do this for obvious financial reasons but it wouldn't cost that much and if we're paying a subscription to play it would be a minuscule fraction of that to make a near perfect copy of the original experience. I might even consider upping the difficulty to compensate for today's playerbase. I think this would make a far superior product that more people would enjoy for longer.</div></div><hr />

Well there was real delay between patches back then, and that wasn't time-gated because the content had to be developed and wasn't ready. Retail content is ready and then artificially time-gated. Phase 1 (patch x) existed because Phase 2 (patch y) wasn't developed etc. that's the difference between Classic WoW and current WoW. It is NOW available but it makes no sense to release all phases at once simply because that's not truthful to the experience that used to be.</div></div><hr />

okay most normal people with healthy lives outside of WoW won't be doing that (IE most of the server you'd be playing on) so gl with that</div></div><hr />

They can do what DBG are doing with EQ progression servers: roll out new servers every once in a while, maybe experiment with content speed or apply some other special rules.<br />
<br />
I'm glad you noticed this because this is exactly what I think they should do. I'm currently playing on Selos EQ progression server and it's actually a ton of fun. <br />
<br />
Can you imagine how cool it would be to have a progression server that goes to wrath and then time locks in that era? Or having a progression server that goes from classic to current content over a year or two? It would add a new flavor to the game and allow you to continue to play the same game but in a different way. And I really don't see this detracting from live wow in any way. <br />
<br />
I think DBG stated that about 1/3 of their total revenue comes from progression servers such as these so they could potentially inject a ton of money into wow again which would be good for everyone.</div></div><hr />

I have been playing a decade or more. Current community suggest that they are not really thinking things well and through. They just scapegoat devs and cry how nostalgic is better while it's just WoW in the end.</div></div><hr />

that is a lie, back on classic there was time gate, and stuff game behind enless grind.<br />
<br />
Naxx was a example of time gate, and the same for Silithus event. Grind and time game exite on wow since vanilla. The only diference you can say is that the ending was bigger that some of time game now.<br />
Ppl prize alot of the bullshit blizzard did on vanilla bc nostalgia. Helll ppl still prize the talent tree for some reason i will never undestand, saying that allow you to be unique, when anyone doing pvp or pve have the same build, just to be competitive. <br />
<br />
ppl are all the time imagine scenarios. Or complain how terrible isnt not having fly on the new zone bc running to ever place take to long, vanilla zone are 10 bigger with 10 time less content and u spend alot of time running, hell i till rememeber how much i hate Blastland back then or Desolace.</div></div><hr />

Vanilla didn't though to be fair.<br />
<br />
BGs weren't until 1.5<br />
<br />
I guess just allowing World PvP at the start means they can stay true to the content release a bit and try and create that authentic experience of Tarren Mill v Southshore and getting ganked like mad in STV. :)</div></div><hr />
