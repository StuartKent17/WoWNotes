Horde lost all the flying pterrordax recolors - there were 3 more colors (as Alliance had 3 different gorgeous gryphons). Now we only have the blue one. I play both factions and I'm really sad they removed all the extra options just because of recolor complaints. I was really looking forward to the gryphons.<br />

Probably the same situation as when Chris Metzen was sorted into the Alliance team during the Azeroth chopper event when people are not motivated to work on something you get well this, maybe I am wrong I hope I am but I find it really sad they could not come up with something better than horses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't you guys see that those mounts are tailored to suit each faction's visual style? Have you seen the new Alliance armor sets? They are GORGEOUS while their Horde counterpart are &quot;more of the same&quot; to say the least. I didn't see any Alliance players talking about them but I'm certain that you would have voiced your discontent if Horde's armors were better than the Alliance's.<br />
<br />
<br />
And Miniron's Head holders are going to be pissed about this Engy Mount....Mecha-Mogul Mk2.<br />

On that we agree. I don't even have Mirmiron's Head and I'm pissed about this new mount. Blizzard just killed my will to farm it.</div></div><hr />

Alli gets 3 ugly horses and Horde gets 3 different types on mounts.<br />
2 of the Horde mounts have rare drop recolours that Alliance have access to....Same can't be said of the Alliance mounts being made available to Horde. Heck even the Warfront mounts have more Horde mounts that the Alliance can get...two raptors and all we get is a Horse Recolour and another with a flag. Alliance also get a new Mount model with the Vicious War Riverbeast, while Horde get a clefthoof model already in game.<br />
<br />
so<br />
Alliance get:<br />
Plain Raptor<br />
Swift Rapter<br />
Hyena<br />
Bloodfeaster<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Horde get...<br />
A Palamino Horse<br />
and a<br />
Horse with a Horde flag....the Horde mounts don't come with flags for the Alliance.(I'm not a fan of the flags)<br />
<br />
And I am fairly sure this expac isn't the only one containing more Alliance bias for mounts...They also can get Hawkstriders...via Boss drop and now Velfs. They can already get a Raptors. Moose mounts, Kodo, Pterodaxx, Undead Horse, Wolf, etc I count at least 11 Horde mount models the Alliance have access to, yet I can only count 4 the Horde get. Not to mention that even tho the Horde WON the motorcycle contest, the Alliance one is not only still available...the fact it was put into the game in the first place meant that winning was meaningless(that players cant even get now...DESPITE WINNING)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyram</div><div class="date">2018-08-13, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 of the Horde mounts have rare drop recolours that Alliance have access to....Same can't be said of the Alliance mounts being made available to Horde. Heck even the Warfront mounts have more Horde mounts that the Alliance can get...two raptors and all we get is a Horse Recolour and another with a flag. Alliance also get a new Mount model with the Vicious War Riverbeast, while Horde get a clefthoof model already in game.<br />
<br />
so<br />
Alliance get:<br />
Plain Raptor<br />
Swift Rapter<br />
Hyena<br />
Bloodfeaster<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Horde get...<br />
A Palamino Horse<br />
and a<br />
Horse with a Horde flag....the Horde mounts don't come with flags for the Alliance.(I'm not a fan of the flags)<br />
<br />
And I am fairly sure this expac isn't the only one containing more Alliance bias for mounts...They also can get Hawkstriders...via Boss drop and now Velfs. They can already get a Raptors. Moose mounts, Kodo, Pterodaxx, Undead Horse, Wolf, etc I count at least 11 Horde mount models the Alliance have access to, yet I can only count 4 the Horde get. Not to mention that even tho the Horde WON the motorcycle contest, the Alliance one is not only still available...the fact it was put into the game in the first place meant that winning was meaningless(that players cant even get now...DESPITE WINNING)<br />
<br />
This. So much this. The Alliance has always found a way to get the Horde mount models (at least a recolor of them) - hell, even with Legion they've gotten Sylvanas' mount (the Forsaken mount) from Karazhan.<br />
They get to farm raptors, kodos, hawkstriders, wolves (even the Korkron wolf was available for like 14 months). The Horde's only way to get a horse up until the honor unicorns (which are unicorns, not horses but still could kinda count) was to farm that PSX shitty Argent horse.<br />
... yet people still complain about mounts being &quot;Horde-biased&quot;. Don't worry, you'll be able to get them in a nice recolor now or in a patch or two, while we just look at your Alliance-only models that will never be shared with the other faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Miniron's Head holders are going to be pissed about this Engy Mount....Mecha-Mogul Mk2.<br />
<br />
Mimirons Head holder here. Not pissed at all.<br />
<br />
But yeah will admit they could have mixed it up a little. Maybe thrown an Elekk, Ram or Nightsaber in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Proudmoore Reputation originally rewards a white reskin of the MoP Armored Grand Gryphon mount that looked amazing. Why was it replaced? Given that horde's Zandalari Empire get a pterrodax (flying mount, unique to Horde on top of that) I don't get this.<br />
<br />
2) Horde get a bonus mount in the form of a series of daily quests for another pterrodax by raising it from daily quests. WTF? Where's the Alliance version of this?<br />
<br />
I strongly feel like this should be remedied, and the simplest way to do so is to give the Alliance their own set of mount-raising dailies... for the reskinned armored grand gryphon mount I was talking about. This seems fair.</div></div><hr />

Don't all alliance reps reward gryphons AND horses?</div></div><hr />

I'm not really calling Horde bias here about the horse mounts but WTF? Are you seriously whining that it's unfair that Alliance get some bland horse model colors that you don't get access to, while still getting access to the horse model from drops, and by far getting more interesting and diverse reputation mounts that -- by the way, Alliance DO NOT get access to?<br />
<br />
Wow... :rolleyes::rolleyes::rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I'd say that I am amazed, but given what I've seen lately with the insanity of the Sylvanas fan club, I'd be lying.<br />

Nope. Not as far as I saw. If they did, I'd be cool with it all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caaethil</div><div class="date">2018-08-13, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Horde lost all the flying pterrordax recolors - there were 3 more colors (as Alliance had 3 different gorgeous gryphons). Now we only have the blue one. I play both factions and I'm really sad they removed all the extra options just because of recolor complaints. I was really looking forward to the gryphons.<br />
<br />
Some of us actually liked the mounts, Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Even if they're recolours and people don't like them, having mounts people don't like is still better than not having mounts at all. Seems a bit silly. Nobody prefers this.</div></div><hr />
