Character Copy is Disabled<br />
Please note that Character Copy is currently disabled in Beta builds. The button is currently not grayed out, but trying to copy account data will fail.<br />
<br />
We'll announce when Character Copy is enabled. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/411717-character-copy-is-disabled/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743706206?page=1#1))<br />
<br />
Premade Characters in Legion Beta<br />
Right now the initial focus of the Beta test will be on stress testing the Legion starting experience, as well as collecting feedback regarding the levelling experience as a whole, so there will no level 110 premades to begin with. That is to say, a very real part of this test is how our content and servers handle this surge of people in a few locations. Even if there are issues, know that highlighting those issues now is very important and useful to Legion's development! <br />
<br />
So if you crash the servers or break content in new and unique ways please take pride in that and we'll fix the issues as fast as we can.<br />
<br />
Once the scope of testing shifts to other aspects of the expansion, then additional types of premades might be introduced to allow further focused testing. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/411621-110-premade-characters-legion-beta/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17611293156?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
PvP Realm and Beta<br />
I like this a lot. Consider forcing 3s too when skirms come about, I think 2v2 double dps battles give a bad impression of the pacing and excluded a lot of specs from real testing (games are almost always over right after or during offensive &amp; defensive CDs).<br />
This is simply due to the number of healers queuing. If there were enough healers, the matches would be all 3s. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/411393-pvp-realm-and-beta-launch/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743795107?page=1#7))<br />

Lots of players gave Overwatch a try during the open beta, with almost 10 million signing up to play 37 million matches over 81 million hours.<br />
Blizzard Entertainment today announced that more than 9.7 million players around the world played its upcoming team-based shooter Overwatch® during the Open Beta for PlayStation®4 computer entertainment system, Xbox One, and Windows® PC, making it Blizzard’s biggest open beta ever. By the time the Open Beta came to a close on May 10, participants had joined forces for more than 4.9 billion minutes (over 81 million hours) across more than 37 million matches of intense competitive action, incredible teamwork, and all-out fun. <br />
<br />
“We're thrilled that such an incredible number of players from around the globe got a chance to check out Overwatch during the Open Beta,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “Our mission was to make sure as many console and PC gamers as possible could experience the full game ahead of its launch—the response was overwhelming, and we hope that everyone had a blast.”<br />
<br />
In Overwatch, players choose from a diverse cast of 21 heroes—each with their own unique arsenal of extraordinary weapons and incredible abilities—and team up to complete objectives on battlefields set in locations around the globe. Blizzard’s first-person shooter will arrive in stores on Windows PC, PlayStation 4 computer entertainment system, and Xbox One starting May 24. Heroes from around the world can join the coming conflict by pre-purchasing Overwatch today at www.playoverwatch.com/buy.<br />

Overwatch has been rated T for Teen by the ESRB.<br />

Activision Blizzard Media Networks Announces Esports Broadcast Network<br />
You may remember that Activision Blizzard acquired MLG earlier this year (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5404-Holy-Paladin-Artifact-Weapon-Preview-Tweets-Activision-Blizzard-and-MLG-Fan-Art). Now we know a little bit more about what they are doing with it.<br />
Today at the IAB Digital Content NewFronts 2016, Activision Blizzard Media Networks (ABMN), a division of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI), announced the launch of new content, broadcast experiences and distribution partnerships for its MLG.tv streaming platform. <br />
<br />
MLG.tv debuted its Enhanced Viewing Experience (EVE) at the event, a High-Definition video stream with a built-in algorithmic system that provides viewers with match statistics, up-to-the-minute leaderboards and situational insights based on the competition they are watching.<br />
<br />
Steve Bornstein, Chairman of ABMN and former CEO of ESPN, took the stage to introduce the network’s host, veteran broadcaster and retired professional gamer Chris Puckett. As host of MLG.tv’s daily ESR broadcast, Puckett will produce up-to-the-minute premium highlights, interviews and news segments for a new generation of sports fans.<br />
<br />
“We’re building a network dedicated to the thrill of competition and the passion of the fans,” said Bornstein. “MLG.tv will play a defining role in realizing the full potential of this audience by creating meaningful, memorable and shareable content.”<br />
<br />
“Esports is a cultural phenomenon at its tipping point, and we’re excited to work with the IAB to bring this message directly to advertisers as part of the 2016 Digital Content NewFronts,” said Mike Sepso, Senior Vice President of ABMN. “The size of our digital network, coupled with our insights into this audience’s viewing habits, put us in a unique position to educate the advertising industry on how to safely target these viewers and reach them on their platform of choice.”<br />
<br />
ABMN will launch this content and more during the MLG Anaheim Open, a two-day Call of Duty®: Black Ops III tournament set to kick off on June 10, 2016. The MLG Anaheim Open will also be the inaugural event as part of a deeper collaboration with Facebook. The collaboration will allow MLG.tv to broadcast live competitions and deliver ESR content to the 1.6 billion people on Facebook.<br />
<br />
“Esports is an exciting space and continues to be a growing priority for us,” said Dan Reed, Head of Global Sports Partnerships for Facebook. “With over 1.6 billion people on the platform and a growing suite of VOD and live streaming products that partners can use to increase engagement, Facebook is uniquely positioned to help esports fans connect around exciting moments and great esports content. We’re thrilled to be working with Activision Blizzard Media Networks, a leader in esports, to help fans enjoy and share a variety of exciting new formats and programming on our platform.”<br />
<br />
ABMN’s NewFronts presentation opened with a video showcasing the division’s record-breaking live championship held last month at Nationwide Arena. Sepso and Puckett were joined by Josh Cella, ABMN’s Head of Sales, to present the new content and advertising opportunities to a packed house at the PlayStation Theater in Times Square. <br />

Marketing has been ... interesting... (read: shit) thus far, but the product doesn't look bad at all.<br />
... well... except the blonde Medivh. Idjits.<br />
... and trying to make Garona sexy. (puke)<br />
... and Ogrim just sounding like a regular human.<br />
<br />
Kinda sad it looks like they won't really make the legion connection obvious / show KJ, but I suppose there's only so much lore you can cram in one film. Hoping they flesh that out far more in the &quot;Second War&quot; film.<br />
.. Actually, speaking of legion..... why has there been NO imagery / screen time of the Draenei? Did they just... cut all of that? I thought there was a clip like a year ago with them all in cages and getting soul-sucked to power the portal.<br />
<br />
Also... when the first orc attacked in the forest scene and the horse spooked, I SWEAR that was the Felsteed audio clip.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't say I play the Beta as I will play when it releases. I don't want too many spoilers, and I feel like it's a waste of time to play it non stop when it'll all be wiped eventually. On Live I still raid and chase mounts/transmogs every reset.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Leaked&quot; clips made the movie seem more real and more palatable than all of the trailers combined. Marketing has been ... interesting... (read: shit) thus far, but the product doesn't look bad at all.<br />
... well... except the blonde Medivh. Idjits.<br />
... and trying to make Garona sexy. (puke)<br />
... and Ogrim just sounding like a regular human.<br />
<br />
Kinda sad it looks like they won't really make the legion connection obvious / show KJ, but I suppose there's only so much lore you can cram in one film. Hoping they flesh that out far more in the &quot;Second War&quot; film.<br />
.. Actually, speaking of legion..... why has there been NO imagery / screen time of the Draenei? Did they just... cut all of that? I thought there was a clip like a year ago with them all in cages and getting soul-sucked to power the portal.<br />
<br />
Also... when the first orc attacked in the forest scene and the horse spooked, I SWEAR that was the Felsteed audio clip.<br />
<br />
This is the beginning. There was no Legion, no Draenai, at the beginning. At least the story at the time, nobody knew they existed. Why are you so greedy? You want everything all at once.</div></div><hr />

Umm, no. Warcraft takes place after the orcs have slaughtered and subjugated the Draenei. They absolutely should be in the movie.</div></div><hr />

I suppose that depends on how you view &quot;beginning.&quot;. In Rise of the Horde, those things absolutely did exist. KJ appeared to Ner'Zhul in a spirit vision posing as Rulkan, and told him to form a Unified Horde to eliminate the Draenei. Durotan and Ogrim met with Velen as children. <br />
<br />
These things existed, but the humans in Azeroth (and the players in WC1) didn't know about them till later.<br />
<br />
It depends on how 'omniscient' the movie chooses to be. As I stated, there's plenty of room to flesh out more in the Second War when Gul'Dan raises the Tomb of Sargeras and part of the Broken Isles.<br />
<br />
It's clear the movie follows Durotan, and he didn't &quot;know &quot; until after his exile, when he confronts Ogrim and is assassinated at the end of the First War -- Which is roughly when Ogrim deposes Backhand and becomes the Warchirf. Likely the last scenes of the movie.</div></div><hr />

Also, you're not just making this movie for Warcraft fans. It has to be sold to the general public or it just won't make enough to justify more (which is surely something we all want?). Adding 'aliens' to the film would be confusing and seem weird to someone not familiar to WoW. Not to mention the amount of time and effort it would require to explain who they were to the audience.<br />
<br />
Humans vs Orcs (with some Dwarfs and Elfs added in) on the other hand is an easy sell to the fantasy crowd. At least for the first movie.<br />
<br />
I would LOVE to see the Arthas/Lich King story on the big screen. But given the timeline that would need both this and probably Warcraft 2 to make money before it happened. It's a long shot :( Fingers crossed! I just hope this films marketing is making a splash outside of the WoW crowd. Hard to tell.</div></div><hr />

Well said. Arthas would be a great story, and 'zombies' always sell. But it's one that definitely requires background.<br />
<br />
I suppose it's like War of the Ancients / Aspects. Awesome story... Confusing as FRACK if you don't already know some of the lore.</div></div><hr />

Unless I am mistaken the movie wasn't going to exactly follow how the storyline went in the game. It like a different universe similar to how Alternate Draenor was, it was similar yet different. This movie is suppose to be similar yet different, which by that logic allows them to do almost anything and include/exclude whatever they want.</div></div><hr />

It is not at all like Draenor. Draenor is still connected to the canon of the the game. The movie will be what Marvel Superhero movies are to the the comics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it felt like some shitty series that shits itself on pilot.<br />
<br />
this movie will be a major let down and i'd be surprised if it gets a rating over 3 on imdb, but at least it seems to be following the same downwards curve since cata so no surprise there.</div></div><hr />

You can cry all day and night if you want, draenei are not in it. In any case, they were reconned into the story. In the beginning, there was no draenei.</div></div><hr />

Back in the day, in the original Thundercat show, one of the villains was half vulture-half Human, and would punctuate his speech with random Kawww!s. In one episode, he wrote instructions that the Thundercats found, and found he wrote the caws in, and they just stopped a moment and asked why he would include those.<br />
