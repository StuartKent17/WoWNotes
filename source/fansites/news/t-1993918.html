<br />
<br />
New Hero Class: Demon Hunter<br />
Dominate your foes as a Demon Hunter, an elven outcast shunned for daring to wield the terrible powers of demons in order to combat the Legion. Exhibiting superior mobility, great martial prowess, and a preternatural ability to detect demons. Demon Hunters can tap into forbidden powers at times of dire need, metamorphosing into terrifying demonic forms. Demon Hunters may choose between two specializations:<br />
<br />
Havoc: This damage-dealing specialization allows you to demolish any who stand in your way with fiery demonic attacks that emphasize rapid melee strikes and battlefield mobility.<br />
Vengeance: This tanking specialization allows you to go toe-to-toe with even the most powerful demons, withstanding massive punishment by channeling the pain of battle and the souls of your enemies.<br />
<br />
New Starting Experience for Demon Hunters<br />
<br />
Start your journey as a member of Illidan’s most elite disciples, an Illidari. Venture out from the Black Temple to lead an assault on the Legion world of Mardum in a desperate attempt to recover the key to defeating the Legion, even as the heroes of Azeroth march against the Black Temple and Illidan.<br />
<br />

Level cap for characters has been increased to 110.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Continent: The Broken Isles<br />
Brave the epicenter of the demon invasion—the Broken Isles, a land rich with ancient wonders. Explore lush forests, colossal mountain ranges, storm swept cliffs, and night elven cities older than human civilization. But beyond the Legion’s marauding army, native dangers lurk here too: twisted satyrs, savage drogbar, and cursed Kvaldir are but a few of the danger’s awoken by the return of the Burning Legion.<br />
Explore the Broken Isles with areas such as:<br />
<br />
Azsuna<br />
Val’sharah<br />
Highmountain<br />
Stormheim<br />
Suramar<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wield Powerful Artifacts<br />
Wield weapons of legend against the Burning Legion. Set out on quests to claim the myth-forged artifact weapons for your class, then grow their power as you continue their legend. Your choices will change their abilities, appearances, and carry them to new heights of power. Fashion your artifacts into the perfect instrument of battle for your specialization, and guide your faction in its most desperate hour.<br />
<br />
Earn Artifact Power by completing nearly any type of content, ranging from outdoor world questing to PvP.<br />
Spend Artifact Power to unlock powerful traits and customize your weapon’s capabilities.<br />
Find ancient relics, socketing them into your artifact to further augment your artifact and customize its traits.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The Emerald Nightmare<br />
The Nighthold<br />

<br />
<br />
New World Bosses<br />
<br />
Challenge yourself against ten new deadly world bosses located throughout the Broken Isles.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
World Scaling<br />
<br />
Forge your own path through The Broken Isles. Level-up zones no longer have level ranges and instead creatures, foes, and rewards scale to your character level allowing you to play through those zones and their dungeons at any level. Zone and dungeon content will still be both challenging and rewarding at any level and allows you to play with friends seamlessly even if your levels are far apart. The max-level zone of Suramar awaits adventurers at the end of their journey.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
World Quests<br />
<br />
World Quests send players out on a variety of quests such as defeating world bosses, world PvP, special dungeon activities, crafting for a profession, story-driven content and more.<br />
World Quests become available for characters that reach level 110 and are displayed on the map to see what's available in each zone.<br />
World Quests rotate throughout the day and over longer periods of time as well.<br />
Emissary quests become available upon reaching level 110 as well. Emissary quests are a daily call for help from a specific faction in Legion.<br />
Completing missions in support of a faction from which you have an emissary quest awards a lucrative cache of loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Revamped PvP Progression and Honor System<br />
<br />
Honor Points and Conquest Points have been removed as a currency. At level 110 players now receive Honor for completing PvP objectives or scoring Honorable Kills. Additionally, players at all levels who complete PvP battlegrounds are awarded a cache that can contain equipment, gold, and transmogrification tokens appropriate for their level along with artifact experience once they’ve obtained their artifact weapon.<br />
Earning Honor increases your Honor Level. Increasing your Honor level unlocks Honor Talents which can provide passive bonuses and new abilities that are enabled whenever players engage in PvP combat (including out in the world).<br />
Players at Honor Level 50 can receive a special reward (a mount, a title, a pet, or a toy) and can Prestige. Electing to Prestige will increase the player's Prestige Level by 1, unlock a special PvP badge, and reset their Honor Level.<br />
Items that were purchased using Honor or Conquest are now available for purchase with Marks of Honor that can be earned from Battlegrounds, Arenas, and Skirmishes.<br />
Learn more about upcoming PvP changes in our Legion PvP Preview.<br />
<br />
Equalized PvP Gear<br />
<br />
Gear has been normalized in PvP combat. Characters entering a Skirmish Arena, Battleground, Rated Arena, Rated Battleground, or Ashran now receive an aura called Principles of War.<br />
Principles of War removes all stats gained from gear (Strength, Stamina, Haste, etc.), disables gear related bonuses (like trinket effects and set bonuses), and gives the character stats based on their specializations, and increases based on overall item level. The goal is to provide a much more finely tuned and balanced PvP experience.<br />
<br />
Arenas<br />
<br />
The pennant attached to the back of characters now changes its appearance based on the player’s best rating in the Arena bracket.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
Characters below level 110 winning a Battleground are now awarded Crates of Battlefield Goods. The crate contains a piece of armor appropriate for the character’s level and specialization with a chance for the crate to contain additional rewards such as weapons or relics.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Transmogrification Collections System: Appearances<br />
<br />
New Collection tab: Appearances<br />
Unlock new appearances by collecting Soulbound weapons and armor your character can equip.<br />
Unlocked appearances are account-wide and usable for transmogrification by other characters that can equip the item.<br />
When first logging into a character after Patch 7.0, the appearances of appropriate items in your bags, bank, and Void Storage are learned automatically. Additional appearances will be unlocked based on previously-completed quests.<br />
Transmogrifiers located in most major cities have been improved with additional features.<br />
<br />
Got a look that you like? Save the entire transmogrification set as an outfit. Create and swap between outfits at the Transmogrifier.<br />
Additionally, transmogrifications can now be associated with your current specialization. Your outfit automatically changes when switching specializations if you so desire.<br />
Added a new option to hide shoulders.<br />
The option to hide helmets, cloaks, and shoulders has been moved into the transmogrification system.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Boosted Character Experience<br />
<br />
Newly boosted characters will receive a lesson on the basics of how to play their new class, as they embark on an airship heading towards the Broken Shore.<br />
<br />
Class Trials<br />
<br />
Try out a new level 100 character before consuming a Boost with the new Class Trials! Class Trials allows a player to create a new level 100 character, learn how to play the class, and get to experience what it feels like to play the class and their artifact weapon.<br />
At the end of the trial experience the character is saved but locked. Players can use a character Boost to unlock the character and keep the character permanently.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
Mythic Dungeons and Keystones<br />
<br />
Mythic difficulty is available for all Legion dungeons. Players who complete a Mythic dungeon may earn a Mythic Keystone pointing to a random Legion dungeon, enabling access to progressively more challenging levels of difficulty, with commensurate rewards.<br />
Completing a Mythic Keystone dungeon within the specified time limit awards a higher-level Keystone, pointing to a new random Legion dungeon, and allowing its holder to access an even higher difficulty and reward level.<br />
At higher Mythic levels, random modifiers are introduced, transforming the rules of the dungeon and the way you play to provide a dynamic experience.<br />
At the beginning of each weekly instance reset period, players receive a special reward based on the highest Mythic level completed in the prior week.<br />
<br />
Legacy<br />
<br />
Ruins of Ahn’Qiraj now resets daily instead of every 3 days.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items and Itemization<br />
Itemization<br />
<br />
In an effort to reduce the amount of gear swapping between specializations, the following changes have been made.<br />
<br />
Legion cloaks, rings, and items worn on the neck are no longer tied to a specific primary stat, and will remain relevant between specializations.<br />
Spirit and Bonus Armor have been removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Multistrike has been removed. Items that had multistrike have had it replaced with another secondary stat.<br />
Trinkets obtained from Raids, PvP, and world drops in Warlords were overtuned and have been brought back to intended power levels.<br />
Set bonuses for item sets from expansions prior to Warlords of Draenor have been deactivated, though the text describing their former function still remains.<br />
<br />
Legendary Items<br />
<br />
Legendary items drop from places all throughout Legion. In addition to stats, these items confer powerful effects and modify abilities. Only a limited number of them can be equipped at a time.<br />
Check out the new Loot tab in the Dungeon Journal to see which Legendary items are out there for you!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character Changes<br />
Specialization System Changes<br />
<br />
Characters can now change between any of their specializations at most any time for a progressive gold cost. Action bar configurations are saved for each specialization. As a result, Dual Specialization has been removed.<br />
Characters can queue up as any role that is available to their class and will automatically switch to the suitable specialization when entering the Dungeon, Raid, Battleground, or Arena without any gold cost. For example, a paladin might be questing as Retribution but queue up in Dungeon Finder as a Tank. When the paladin enters the dungeon, they will automatically switch to Protection.<br />
<br />
Updates to Combat Visuals and Audio<br />
<br />
Updated and improved on the animations, visual effects, and audio on core combat interactions like auto-attacks as well as many melee class abilities.<br />
<br />
Talent System Changes<br />
<br />
Players are now able to switch talents while out of combat without the need for reagents.<br />
<br />
Glyph System Changes<br />
<br />
The Glyph panel has been removed from the game. Some minor glyphs that had a cosmetic effect that does not apply to a specific spell have been converted into cosmetic items that provide the same effects as before.<br />
Some minor glyphs that made cosmetic alterations to a specific spell have been added to the spell itself in the spellbook.<br />
<br />
Draenor Perks Removed<br />
<br />
Draenor Perks have been removed from the game.<br />
<br />
Armor Changes<br />
<br />
Hunters and Shaman can now equip Mail armor from level 1 (down from level 40).<br />
Warriors and Paladins can now equip Plate armor from level 1 (down from level 40).<br />
New Mail and Plate reward options have been added to low level quests.<br />
<br />
Racial Abilities<br />
Human<br />
<br />
Every Man for Himself now removes all Stun effects and shares a 30-second cooldown with other items or abilities that have a similar effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Changes<br />
All classes and specializations have undergone changes to abilities and mechanics. Check out our class preview logs for a better understanding on the thought process behind these changes.<br />

<br />
A number of items with novel effects have been converted for inclusion in the Toy Box.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Increase profession skills to an increased cap of 800.<br />
Hundreds of new recipes and patterns have been added.<br />
Profession content is more closely tied to the world. Many of recipes will be learned by completing quests, finding hidden trainers, and going on adventures out in the Broken Isles.<br />
Recipes can now have multiple ranks. As you become more skilled in your profession, you will learn to craft or gather more efficiently.<br />
Equipment limits on the amount of crafted gear that can be worn have been removed.<br />
The Obliterum Forge, unlocked with a questline at level 110, will allow players to destroy their crafted gear and obtain Obliterum. Obliterum, in turn, can be used to make crafted gear more powerful.<br />
<br />
Inscription<br />
<br />
Major glyphs, along with many minor glyphs, have been converted or removed from the game.<br />
Scribes can now craft Vantus Runes, a consumable item that allows a player to perform more effectively against one particular raid boss each week.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
UI<br />
<br />
Character nameplates have been reworked and have been upgraded to show class resources. Players may select a larger version of these nameplates from within the Interface Options menu.<br />
Enemy nameplates now provide additional information on status effects.<br />
Added class resource bars that display directly underneath your character.<br />
The character sheet has been trimmed down, though fully verbose stats are still available via the API.<br />
Interface options have changed and been further streamlined.<br />
Tab targeting logic has been reworked, and should now behave in a more consistent and predictable manner.<br />
A buff icon has been added to make it easier to tell when a character has XP gain disabled.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Account<br />
<br />
The maximum amount of gold that can be held at once has been increased to 9,999,999 gold. Guild bank maximum has also been increased to 9,999,999 gold.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Maximum draw distance has been extended greatly for Legion content.<br />
5 additional levels of graphics presets have been added with 3 above the previous ‘Ultra’ setting.<br />
More advanced rendering techniques for fog have been added.<br />
Modern techniques for rendering color and other post-effects have been added.</div></div><hr />

The big thing with prior raid tier gear was gem slots. The set bonus was ok but not game breaking. However being able to shove 100+ of a non scaling gem stat into gear was great. Hopefully they do not kill that system and we can just get gear with the most gem slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Min/Maxing is one of the most fun parts of the game for a lot of people, myself included. Using old Tier sets for Timewalking was part of that min/maxing process, and its really sad to see them remove it, for seemingly no purpose whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

&gt;everything looks ok<br />
&gt;&quot;old set bonuses have been deactivated&quot;<br />
WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU TAKE AWAY NOT ONLY TWINKING FOR HERALD BUT ALSO THE ONLY THING THAT MADE TIMEWALKING FUN WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING BLIZZARD<br />
<br />
Blame mythic raiders doing long pull timers so they can switch out old gear sets to get bonuses for the pull. It's completely stupid having classes do that. It would make more sense to just disable old sets in new raids but Blizz is lazy. I'm personally glad it's gone, it's tedious having to do that before a pull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats exactly right, the OBVIOUS solution is to disable them in current content in one way or another, but this is such a classic blizzard response to remove them entirely rather than just prevent them being abused in the one small situation where they are being abused. Its exactly like how they responded to Shadowpriests abusing Twist of Fate in MoP, by making it only proc on healing for healers and damage for dps, which basically made it completely shit for Disc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, very excited for almost all of these changes and upcoming content!<br />
<br />
Not entirely, but glyphs will instead be applied directly to the ability in question.<br />
Upgrading the spell if you like, with one glyph being applied to it.<br />
Vaguely like how we used to have spell ranks, only you get the additional modification of the glyph instead of a straight up numbers increase.<br />
<br />
As far as crafting and selling goes, Vantus Runes could play a large part in the demand but time will tell how that pans out.<br />
What the future holds for the glyph market we have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />

Ooooorrrr it's a lot of work redoing old set bonuses for a tiny little sliver of people who really want them for something as secondary as Timewalking dungeons or Mythic raiders who abuse them, so it's just as well to not need to rebalance or rewrite them anymore by just removing them entirely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And then there is the twinking community, too..., I know, according to Watcher's post, we are all minorities, thus irrelevant to the devs. Thanks for that.<br />
<br />
Edit: well they supposedly have the biggest dev team in WoW history *cough*, they could make themselves useful...<br />
<br />
I'm just sad tbh, I wanted Legion to be an xpac I want to play, but there's bad news coming almost every day that makes me not want to play.. :(</div></div><hr />

Blizzard used to be a good company but seems like they cant keep up anymore. Heroes of the storm, big failure, legion will result in an even bigger decrease of subscribers after some months so another failure. I played overwatch a bit and it was boring as hell, so my guess. ANOTHER FAILURE. Wtf are you doing blizzard?<br />

Going from a company which i loved and always said were the best, going from that, to almost hated takes some serious fuck ups. Fuck up after fuck up after fuck up.

I mean sure, you come up with 32 sets of bonus' for each class/spec at short notice. Or... we disable them since a lot of them don't work anymore they tune timewalking for gear available...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it's such a minute issue because a 'tiny little sliver' of people are doing it in TW or Mythic raids, then wtf are blizzard doing wasting their time removing it in the first place? How does it affect you in the slightest? If you can't be fucked farming an old raid or two (which is easier than Legion questing) and using a macro or two before a 15s raid pull-timer, or a macro to change gear sets for TW, then.... DONT. Nobody gives a fuck. Leave it alone for the rest of us who like having interesting things to do with gear.</div></div><hr />

Armor Changes<br />
Hunters and Shaman can now equip Mail armor from level 1 (down from level 40).<br />
Warriors and Paladins can now equip Plate armor from level 1 (down from level 40).<br />
New Mail and Plate reward options have been added to low level quests.<br />
Caught my eye the most<br />
<br />
<br />
less fighting of gear i suppose being Shaman and hunters won't share with the leather up until 40 anymore. <br />
then again. Heirlooms and the Helpful satchels filled up that issue anyway</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Only a few people did anything with old set bonuses.. which you claim helps a feature that is a new bonus thing to do. Like how can you even complain about this. Min maxing for timewalking was an OPTIONAL thing to do for a suboptimal nostalgic side event.<br />
-Indeed most people dont like this either. I'm glad amongst all your ranting you could say something useful<br />
-Crit haste mastery...thats it.... Thats like 1 more stat than used to be in the game. Unless you are going to be a nutter and include Hit and defense.<br />
-They...arent ...called glyphs. most specs had only 2 viable major glyphs and the rest were utility which got backed in or altered with specs and other talents. and minor glyphs are tomes you buy to alter your spells.<br />
-Yes....Also each spec has gotten like 10 more abilities. you can alter your talents to change the complexity of your spec. neat huh.<br />
-Tons of great class redesign. is there any reason you dont like any of it? Like most specs still play exactly like they do on live. the only specs that were even changed were ones that had no identity or felt &quot;wrong&quot; to begin with (like demonology)<br />
-&quot;gear is now +gooder all purpose gear&quot;, what does this even mean. Only thing i can guess at is you want gear that is worthless to a player to be something they might pick if they dont know better.<br />
-Yes, with several million people they are going to not be &quot;in line&quot; with literally everyones class fantasy. Is there even a point to pointing that out? Yea big freaking deal. If you want a spellcaster that turns into a demon...play a demon hunter. No &quot;frostfire mage&quot; either , going to complain about that too?<br />
<br />
It would really help if maybe you could actually give a critic. A critic is where you talk about something in dept and say WHY its bad and rebuttal any possible position that goes against what you'd say. Blizz devs have spent devs trying to tell stupid people &quot;This is bad and i hate it&quot; is not the slightest bit useful info.<br />
<br />
I would personally ask you to not buy this expansion and go play something else because i REALLY dont want to be playing with people who hate everything as much as you do. Please sit down and think about your life.</div></div><hr />

Please fucking tell me the progressive gold has a cap...<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Going back to this it might be even worse than i thought, it is not that its just a huge gold drain which nobody likes but could potentially mean that the order halls garrisons will generate so much gold and goodies from missions and whatnot that we will see a similar situation to what happended in WOD, hence the need to sink the players gold reserves<br />

Rogues can use the MoP tier set a few seconds before pull to get extra combat points/energy/buff uptime or something on pull. I dont know the specifics as ive never played a rogue, but i know the rogues in our raid team do it. They gain a small boost in their burst.</div></div><hr />

To give them a small benefit of the doubt -- it's already like this if you swap too often.<br />
It goes from something like 31g to 50, to 75 to 100 and caps at 100 or so.<br />
Will be something worth testing to see though.</div></div><hr />

Lets just go ahead and remove all cloth, leather, mail, and plate from the game too and just rename it all to &quot;Armor&quot; and weapon types too while we are at it.<br />
<br />
players might get confused having to choose between a gun or a bow! lets just call them &quot;weapons&quot; instead and that way everyone will be the same!<br />
<br />
hell lets just remove all the fucking classes too while youre at it and give everyone all the exact same class with only one predetermined skill set and everyone has the same stats.

<br />
Its actually the complete opposite. When gear is not part of the equation, the individual skills of each player at pvping with their spec/class are greatly emphasized. It also lets Blizz tweak pvp stats for each spec to adjust for emergent imbalance issues... those pop up every season as the really good players find OP exploits.</div></div><hr />

Just because you want the game to be loaded with convenience does not mean that blizzard have to make it that way.<br />
<br />
The new transmog system also wasn't meant to be a way for you to collect every transmog in the game by playing a single character, it was meant for saving bag space by not having to keep shit around that you only use for transmog.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glyphs allowed players to have some control over how they wanted to play the game - Blizzard has hated that since Wrath, it wants everyone to play the way Blizz wants them to, because Blizzard knows best (and has the sub numbers to prove it).</div></div><hr />

The new transmog system also wasn't meant to be a way for you to collect every transmog in the game by playing a single character, it was meant for saving bag space by not having to keep shit around that you only use for transmog.<br />
<br />
So unlocking all heirlooms with a single character is &quot;convenience&quot;? Unlocking a golden (light blue in Legion) two-handed mace with a mage is A-OK, but unlocking a purple two-handed mace with a mage is HERESY, HE CAN'T EQUIP IT?<br />
<br />
Yeah, no, it's about consistency. Did the player's class matter when obtaining the item? No? Then it goes into the collection so that whatever character can use it in the end uses it. That's the sensible way. It's how an account wide system should work (and it's how ALREADY works, no need to create another, more clumsy and shortsighted, system).<br />
<br />
Just because you want twisted senseless systems just for the sake of jumping a million hoops for to really really super validate stuff you've already validated doesn't mean it's &quot;just convenience&quot;.<br />
<br />
The new wardrobe system wasn't made just &quot;for saving bag space&quot;. The infinite cloud space is what was made for saving bag space. There are other features and the account wide appearance unlocking feature is the one that is badly executed, because it takes in consideration restrictions that didn't matter when getting the item and shouldn't matter when storing it, because they never mattered before.</div></div><hr />

http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20419652804?page=1#8<br />

<br />
Gear has been normalized in PvP combat. Characters entering a Skirmish Arena, Battleground, Rated Arena, Rated Battleground, or Ashran now receive an aura called Principles of War.<br />
Principles of War removes all stats gained from gear (Strength, Stamina, Haste, etc.), disables gear related bonuses (like trinket effects and set bonuses), and gives the character stats based on their specializations, and increases based on overall item level. The goal is to provide a much more finely tuned and balanced PvP experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
R.I.P. PvP... You will truly be missed... Maybe one day Vanilla, BC,WotLk, Cata or MOP servers will be up, until then goodbye wow<br />
<br />
Heaven forbid PVP should be solely based on the better player, and not an astronomical stat advantage from PVP gear. That's just ludicrous, right?</div></div><hr />

Glyphs allowed players to have some control over how they wanted to play the game - Blizzard has hated that since Wrath, it wants everyone to play the way Blizz wants them to, because Blizzard knows best (and has the sub numbers to prove it).<br />
<br />
so i guess they are going to remove talents too<br />
<br />
oh yeah &quot;since wrath&quot; so why did they add MORE GLYPHS and MORE GLYPH SLOTS in cata?<br />

no after 100 switches it will cost 50 mil gold to twitch... of corse it will cap, just like how our current respeccing caps<br />

Finnaly got the email telling me about my beta invite. Seems beta us starting up tomorrow on the 12th. <br />
Welcome to the Legion beta test! Starting at approximately 2 p.m. PDT May 12, you can experience and provide feedback on the exciting new features of World of Warcraft’s next expansion, including:<br />

so jelly...<br />

<br />
&quot;Soft Foam Sword, sold by Jepetto Joybuzz. The toy mortally wounds (but does not kill) an enemy of trivial difficulty.&quot; <br />
<br />
Doesn't that mean it kills the enemy?<br />
<br />
lets say your level 110, trying to do a level 10 quest, and the quest is &quot;weaken a enemy then cast X on them&quot;<br />
<br />
this item will bring them to 5% health and stun them if they are lower level then you by far...<br />
<br />
so it will mean you can do quest that even if you remove all your gear and just punch, but still kill them<br />

Why the hell removing old set bonuses? It was fun to put together old sets for Timewalking...<br />
<br />
And that's probably the answer.. Fun detected -&gt; Fun removed.<br />
<br />
I can understand why Watcher didn't mention that in the interview, tho. :-(<br />
<br />
Also: Streamlining interface options even more.. Like the game need MOAR STREAMLINING<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
because lots of old sets are built on specific abilities that are no longer even a thing, so yeah... for example, burning embers are gone so letting those old bonuses say of extra embers they would have to remake those... ones that do with shadowbolt on affliction, or corruption on destruction, etc<br />
<br />
lots of abilities are being removed/moved to specicifc specs oold sets become broken and buggy and they rather not spend the time to do so</div></div><hr />

Heaven forbid PVP should be solely based on the better player, and not an astronomical stat advantage from PVP gear. That's just ludicrous, right?<br />
<br />
It's always been about the player.. If you like PvP enough to put the time in to get the gear then you should reap the benefits. You can't just PvP a couple times a week and complain about not having the gear to beat someone who PvPs for a living lol.. It's always been about the player and skill/time and effort. Now it's not<br />

You'll be back in the next expansion which will probably be Wotlk 2.0 if the pattern continues. Introducing WoW WoRC(Wrath of Recycled Content) and the new PvP system. In PvP combat all class abilities and models are removed. Players will be given black morph suits to wear with a single ability called &quot;TAG!&quot; that will send enemies start to their graveyard. We finally did it after 12 years guys, we finally manage to balance PvP..<br />
<br />
Never said I was never coming back, if the next xpac after Legion is good then hell yeah I will be back you better believe it. But if the pattern continues to ez mode then I wont be, people can hate on me all they want but I am not alone. This PvP system is horribad</div></div><hr />

It's funny how most of the reviewers agreed that visuals in the movie are ridiculously good. Not good enough for MMO champ crowd though :) We are looking at the same footage, and CGI and the level of details is really something else. I understand that it might just look average to you, but claiming they are cheap is just baseless hate. The film had a pretty big budget, which they breached, of course, and CGI and the costumography was done by a studio that got multiple Oscars for their work. How is it cheap to you is beyond me. Maybe you are one of those that thought Avatar was horrible (visually).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was headed that way in WOD. Glyphs are now pure cookie cutter, only specific ones will sell, and the market will be flooded. The only other use will be for toys.They seem to have so much trouble designing and balancing classes, they're minimizing any way you can build viable hybrid builds, because someone might come up with something that's OP. <br />
<br />
Professions used to matter, a LOT. Now, they're about as important as pet battles. No, wait, pet battles get more attention now.<br />

<br />
Its actually the complete opposite. When gear is not part of the equation, the individual skills of each player at pvping with their spec/class are greatly emphasized. It also lets Blizz tweak pvp stats for each spec to adjust for emergent imbalance issues... those pop up every season as the really good players find OP exploits.<br />
<br />
True. But I will remain skeptical of anything Holinka is involved with. Sounds good on paper, lets see how it plays.<br />

<br />
i hope the gold cost for spec switching will be removed..<br />
<br />
this is not funny and solve NOTHING!<br />
<br />
it brings only bad feeling to the game!<br />
<br />
The irony is, how popular a decision it was when they removed the cost, because guilds usually ended up paying for tanks and healers to respec. <br />
<br />
It's typical of Blizzard - they'll spend a year designing Garrisons or Order Halls, and then at the last minute throw changes like this in, usually by the path of least resistance and work. Clearly they want to stop spec switching, for reasons, and this is the easiest way to do it.<br />
<br />
It's just like back in Vanilla, when gold farmers were exploiting chests in dungeons. Instead of thinking about it - they just removed them all.<br />
<br />
It's really odd sometimes, their thought processes.</div></div><hr />

you pretty clearly explained why. With the massive changes to a lot of classes the half sets still working will be down to what ? 15% 20% ? Is easier to simply put every class at the same level.</div></div><hr />

Wait, so what you're telling me is you want a system more like Call of Duty than Counterstrike.

Maybe you can't see it but for many the warcraft movie just doesn't look real.

Go read some of the reviews found online. While they say that plot is just average, they unanimously agree that the visuals are amazing. And the people that were shown parts of the movie during the last Blizzcon said the same thing. But low budget, yes :) MMO champ has really turned into just hating everything Blizzard.

Sure, it has less than amazing points but the good seem to far outnumber the bad from what I've seen so far. I know all you amazingly brilliant people on this site like to unashamedly hate anything you possibly can but, lighten up. You'll all watch it regardless, whether by downloading some awful copy, waiting for a decent download or actually leaving the house to see it. How else will you properly complain about it? ;) Then again, I know some on this site that can complain quite a lot about things they've never even done/seen so...<br />

I never played any of those games so... But it's not hard to get PvP gear in general.. Even if you don't play nearly as much as player X you can still catch up to him pretty easily, thus being equal.. People act like it's impossible to get gear lolol.. Player X got his gear in 1 week cause he PvPs all the time.. But player Z only PvPs a couple times a week so it took him 3 weeks to get gear, that is not fair! hahahaha like ummm... Of course it's fair, but after that 3 weeks player Z is caught up to player X, ta da! See how that works? You PvP to get PvP gear, instead of this copy/paste system you want</div></div><hr />

Not good enough for MMO champ crowd though :) We are looking at the same footage, and CGI and the level of details is really something else. I understand that it might just look average to you, but claiming they are cheap is just baseless hate. The film had a pretty big budget, which they breached, of course, and CGI and the costumography was done by a studio that got multiple Oscars for their work. How is it cheap to you is beyond me. Maybe you are one of those that thought Avatar was horrible (visually).<br />
<br />
I guess I should have clarified, my apologies. I'm not knocking the CGI, specifically. I agree that it does look quite amazing; however, the acting performances are what I was (mostly) referring to.</div></div><hr />

Dual spec appears to have been removed, in order to revert to previous method of changing specs.. without gold refund on every hero with dual spec.<br />
<br />
The patch notes clearly state that Dual Specialization has been removed:<br />
<br />
<br />
Specialization System Changes<br />
<br />
Characters can now change between any of their specializations at most any time for a progressive gold cost. Action bar configurations are saved for each specialization. As a result, Dual Specialization has been removed.<br />
Characters can queue up as any role that is available to their class and will automatically switch to the suitable specialization when entering the Dungeon, Raid, Battleground, or Arena without any gold cost. For example, a paladin might be questing as Retribution but queue up in Dungeon Finder as a Tank. When the paladin enters the dungeon, they will automatically switch to Protection.<br />
<br />
Blizzard never gives any sort of refund for anything the player has paid for that then gets removed from the game at a later date.</div></div><hr />

Can you think of any reason why skill shouldn't be the only thing that matters? Do you actually think that wasting time should give you an advantage over another player? If a team outplays you, they should win. <br />
<br />
Literally the only reason you would want gear advantages in PvP is because you think you should have more rewarded to you for your time than simply improving as a player. Well, that's what PvE is for. PvP should ONLY be about the actual Player vs Player interaction. As someone who has basically only played WoW for PvP since BC I absolutely love this change. It allows for a much more balanced experience, and allows the feedback on what needs changing to actually be clear because there's a formulated standard of power for every class.<br />

I want to PvP to PvP. Period. I don't want to PvP to get gear. It doesn't matter if it's easy to get, I actually can't get friends to play PvP with me in this game because they think the concept of gear in a skill based game is absurd. I've never liked gear being a factor since BC, but I just accepted it as a definite part of the game. We can say it's catering to casuals all we want...but frankly...what do you think the majority of the player base is? Do you think that everyone has time to play WoW 4-8 hours per day?</div></div><hr />

Watching your alt slowing getting stronger in PvP through expierence and gear is awesome. If you want skill vs skill get higher ratings in Arena or RBGS if you get high ratings everyone has the same gear, so there its only skill vs skill..<br />
<br />
Also building your character the way you want is what makes games like this fun.. Choosing the stats you want etc.. The whole copy/paste thing is ez mode for Blizzard</div></div><hr />
