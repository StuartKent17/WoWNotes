Artifact Power has been a hot topic lately, both around the community and within the development team. With Patch 7.2 on the horizon, introducing both new artifact traits and additional Knowledge levels, we have been reflecting on the way the system has unfolded during the first months of Legion, and evaluating changes based on the lessons we have learned thus far.<br />
<br />
First off, a look back at where we started.<br />
<br />
From the outset, Artifact Power was intended to serve two intertwined purposes: First, it offered max-level progression that was not entirely item-driven, along with choices and elements of character customization as players traversed their trait trees; second, it was meant to serve as a universally desired, consistent reward from all types of content.<br />
<br />
In crafting the systems that delivered Artifact Power, we weighed the merits of hard caps versus a smoother system of diminishing returns. We had extensive experience with hard caps, through multiple past iterations of currencies like Valor Points and Conquest Points, and wanted to avoid several of the downsides of that approach. For example, a cap inherently feels like more of an expected quota, where missing a week or falling short of the cap puts you clearly, and potentially permanently, behind the curve. <br />
<br />
Instead, as everyone knows, we settled on an open-ended system of diminishing returns. Without any hard caps on how quickly players could earn AP, it was essential to have some sort of limiting mechanism on the gap in power between players of different playstyles, and different levels of time investment. We accepted the admittedly complex design of Artifact Knowledge because it solved this problem, effectively reining in the size of this power gap. Players trying to progress past the expected artifact level for their Knowledge would run into those rapidly diminishing returns, while those who played less than that would have Knowledge as an accelerator to help them catch up to the cutting edge. When Emerald Nightmare was new content, while the average raider was at 20 or 21 points, the most dedicated might have been at 24 or 25 – a relatively modest gap.<br />
<br />
Now, where things went wrong…<br />
<br />
We feel that we made two major missteps with the Artifact Power system that increasingly manifested themselves as we got deeper into Patch 7.1 and 7.1.5. And both of them served to undermine that core goal of ensuring that the gap between players with different levels of time invested into the system could not grow too large. <br />
<br />
First, the cost of ranks in the 20-point final trait remained relatively flat, as opposed to the rapid exponential scaling up to that point. This meant that someone who spent twice as much time gathering AP as I did would have roughly twice as many ranks as me. Instead of the 24 vs. 21 gaps we saw in Nightmare, a number of hardcore raiders entered Nighthold with 54 points, while others were just beginning that final progression and found themselves with nearly 10% less health and damage, equivalent to being almost a full tier of gear behind. Players who switched specs or characters along the way found themselves in a similar position. The power gap was larger than ever before, which created a sense of obligation and a number of negative social pressures that the system had previously tried to minimize. In short: We’re not at all happy with how this worked out.<br />
<br />
A common suggestion is to simply reduce the amount of Artifact Power required to fully unlock the artifact in 7.2. This would not solve the underlying problem, but would rather reduce its duration while heightening its intensity, as competitive players sprinted to finish their Artifacts in order to be “ready.” But then we would inevitably tune around that completed power level, and other players would simply be playing catch-up the entire time. And in the long run, Artifact Power would not be serving its intended purpose of ongoing parallel progression. A capped-artifact player who goes a week without getting any item upgrades ends the week literally no stronger than before. Part of the value of the artifact, both for personal progression and guild progression, lies in ensuring that everyone is at least a bit stronger next week than they are right now, and a bit closer to overcoming whatever obstacle stands in their path. Our goal is for Artifact Power to always be of some interest as a reward, whether from a World Quest, or as a consolation prize when failing a bonus roll. <br />
<br />
Instead, we are focusing on fixing the mistake of flat cost scaling at the end of the progression, and instead keeping the increases exponential throughout, while also strengthening Artifact Knowledge as a core pacing and catch-up mechanism. These changes should be visible in an upcoming PTR build. <br />
<br />
This is done with the primary goal of reducing the power gap based on time investment, while preserving Artifact Power as an endgame reward that everyone values. If the leaders in Artifact Power were only a few points ahead of a more typical player, rather than crossing the finish line when most were just leaving the starting blocks, players with less time to commit would not be as disadvantaged in competitive activities. If a Warlock were choosing between having 48 points in a single spec or 44 points in all three specs if they’d split their efforts evenly, the barrier to playing multiple specs would be significantly reduced. We are still tuning the curve for 7.2 trait costs, but we’re currently targeting scaling such that someone who earns twice as much AP as me will have an artifact that’s only ~1.5% stronger; someone who earns four times as much AP as me should only be 3% stronger. On the whole, this should be a massive reduction in the power gaps we see in the live game today.<br />
<br />
The second problem with our initial implementation was that repeatable sources of Artifact Power (Mythic Keystone dungeons in particular) dominated time-limited sources such as Emissary caches and raid bosses. The fact that a large portion of the community evaluates their Artifact Power needs using “Maw runs” as the unit of measurement is ample evidence of this failure. We very recently deployed a hotfix to increase AP earned from Nighthold in order to make raiding, with a weekly-lockout, better compare in efficiency to repeated Mythic Keystone runs. And in 7.2, we’re more thoroughly addressing this issue by adding a significant amount of AP to the weekly Mythic Keystone cache, while somewhat reducing (and normalizing based on instance length) the AP awarded by repeated runs. These changes are being made to narrow the gap in AP earning, and thus power, based on time investment.<br />
<br />
All of the above changes are aimed at allowing players the freedom and flexibility to decide how they want to spend their time, and which goals they wish to pursue, while limiting the difference in power between players who arrive at different answers to those questions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Richardbro</div><div class="date">2017-02-16, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should just make it so artifact levels unlock time based. For example, Artifact level 58 opens for everyone this week, 59 next week. BUT, you can still freely farm artifact power endlessly and get to level 60+, but the power and traits won't unlock until the week for level 60+ comes, so everyone is on a fair playing field and people dont have to burn out - which also still allows massive grinding.</div></div><hr />

Repeatable M+ dungeons for AP is one of the bigger issues here.</div></div><hr />

He mentions a nerf on repeated runs, I'm hoping that's related to repeating a dungeon at the same or lower + then you have already completed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Say you clear heroic NH in 3 hours every week that is 10*125k AP =1.25M<br />
Say you spend those 3 hours farming MoS 7-9 at 18 mins per run (including finding keys) that means 10*250k AP = 2.5M AP <br />
<br />
You get double the amount of AP from mythic+ than you get from raidin. On top of that mythic+ is endlesly repeatable.<br />
What a shit system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem comes down to though, if they allow people to get too far ahead cause they can play all the time, they have to tune around those people, and then EVERYONE else needs to reach that cap. Its partly what caused EN to be a pushover (not figuring people would have so many traits), Helya to be overtuned (tuned around a good portion of the raid having 54 traits) etc. (Though you can totally have 54 traits by the time you reach 54 trait bosses in NH in a &quot;normal&quot; mythic guild, the WF guilds are an outlier)</div></div><hr />

Problem is a hard cap will be most people getting everything done on reset day, then those who are busy for whatever reason that week and can only come on for the weekend/Monday (or Tuesday in Europe) will be out of luck. Weekly capped currency has shown this time and again where people just can not be fucked to help out others if there is nothing in return for them. <br />
<br />
So essentially someone comes in and goes &quot;Hey guys, I got a mythic + stone for x.&quot; will be basically met by crickets if it isn't first couple days after reset. That's a worse game design than we have now.</div></div><hr />

I get they want to make characters unique and choices to be made but I, Christina, farmed all the AP I have for currently 3 toons. I'm a more competitive player (not quite cut throat hard core) and I am playing on a team that is 3/10 heroic because the main monk toon I had got 2 legendaries of opposing specs and that was it. Meanwhile in less time than the first, my 2nd monk got a BIS legendary and 2 others that were useful to wear. I had to reroll her as my main but now I'm terribly far behind and no one more competitive needs me right now. One step in the right direction is fixing the AP issue. Having to start all over again really hurt. But the legendary issue was also a problem because what IF you got the wrong specced legendary like I did and countless others did? You got screwed. I have some friends who play every single day doing everything they can and only have 2 legendaries on their mains. They're not bitter or anything. Meanwhile there are people who level to 110 and within 3 weeks had 4 legendaries. It was insane.</div></div><hr />

... Since when in this game has non-raiders been given gear as powerful as what can be obtained from raids?<br />
In fact, Legion is the expansion where non-raiders have a real shot at being as powerful with Mythic+. Imo it should be scaled back. Nothing good will come from people expecting that they can get as shiny epix from 5-man content as from groups requiring 20 people...</div></div><hr />

I pay monthly for this game, I like things to do on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
And others prefer grinds that end, and want to be able to do things with their playtime that don't award Artifact Power without continually falling behind everyone who's only pursuing the most utilitarian content.<br />
<br />
Artifact Power is a godawful system. The argument that &quot;people who invest more in the game should get more out of it&quot; should be true to a point, but Legion lost the plot and never got it back. There was never a point in the game's history where someone could pour 30 or 40 hours a week into WoW, literally as much as a second job, and still be behind people who were willing to dump 60, 80, or more hours into it (save the very bleeding edge of world first raiding). That's what comes of having no ceiling. And this diminishing returns system won't fix that.</div></div><hr />

If you raid mythic, you will do 2-3 times the output of said &quot;casual scum&quot;.<br />
The 10% of artifact won't even make a dent by comparison, which is why I am somewhat confused about Blizzard making a big fuss about it.<br />
<br />
But I guess raider A cried to his mommy because raider B put more time in and got to do a few % more DPS, which is why raider C (who is a raidlead) prefers raider B over raider A. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Also if someone is willing to put in the time and effort into getting their weapon ap lvl higher they should be rewarded for it.<br />

I do my Cache, raid NH, LFR NH, run around 10-15 mythic pluses(+5-9) a week since AK25, AND IM ONLY at 43. If you are truly 880-885 geared, because you said you are raiding normal, and artifact 54, I'd like you to prove it. Because, I truly don't believe it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having a cap is very important in this game. It's what makes players come back every week and stay subscribed.

<br />
WoWs gear reward system is just broken.<br />
<br />
Because a raider needs to kill gul'dan, who threatens the world. One of the more threatening and powerful beings alive. A non-raider has to kill some vermin and pull a few weeds so someones farm isn't being demolished. Also, raiders get that gear from saving the world while a non-raider gets his gear from pulling said weeds. <br />
<br />
I don't see how it is a problem. Besides, right now you can even get max ilvl bis gear from pulling weeds or doing a normal dungeon with titanforging. So even with all that I just said, the argument is invalid. The chance of getting higher gear as a raider is just higher. As it should be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perfect for:<br />
<br />
1. Finally being able to use all 3 specs(assuming the legendary token system is going to happen)<br />
2. Reducing importance of AP grind SIGNIFICANTLY - you do the mean every week, you will be within a couple of percentage points of the best<br />
<br />
So now that Blizzard has negated the need to AP grind and basically will be giving us all the legendaries, and flying in the same patch, and removed the non-gear incentive to grind mythic+, what will they bitch about next? My guess: Muh lack of conteeent</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt many people who completed their artifacts, whine over nothing to do. In previous expansions (good and bad ones) we had all the same tasks. We had plenty to do. Therefore, let people get finished with artifact power. Don't come here assuming hell is unleashed if there is nothing to use artifact power on. It would be a blessing if all you did for 7.2, was to give +5 AK with the same 54 levels. Give people a break to focus on other specs, alts or .. Dare i say it .. real life.<br />
<br />
The four doubling increase of AP, only helps to further delude the option of following multiple specs and multiple alts. In no way, does these changes present options for easier reroll of spec or alt, ONLY a four doubled grid, for when this happens.<br />
<br />
Instead of going for the 54 AL as being a fine system, where I with the same time and effort could have gotten one main fully powered in all 3 AND 1 spec on 1 alt or 1 spec on 4 alts, I would now have to pull ALL this effort into one single spec. It's beyond stupid to reason that it should become easier, when infact you make it much harder. I understand your secret desires - keep people hooked to play - but your reasoning is flawed and simply untrue. To conclude:<br />
<br />
The fundamental flaws with AP has only been increased with 7.2, it has not been helped.</div></div><hr />

Have a total AP hard cap. Raise it weekly. Have AK only work when you're behind.<br />

Not sure how difficulty plays into the telling of a story...oh wait, it doesn't. It's nice that players have a choice in how they want to experience content through difficulty levels - but hey, bashing on LFR is the in thing so whatever makes you feel better about yourself, go for it. ;)<br />
<br />
The irony of course is if LFR didn't exist...guess what? Normal would be treated the EXACT same way LFR is right now. And if it was only Heroic and Mythic? Yep you guessed it - Heroic would be for the &quot;plebs in the eyes of the self conscious, narrow minded players of today's WoW who care more about what other people are doing instead of worrying about themselves.</div></div><hr />

Nothing should be done to the AP system. To be blunt you should feel forced to do other content. If they dont think this is good then they should be consistent. They arent.</div></div><hr />

It's funny that you say that because while Blizzard was ripping off ideas from Diablo 3, they forgot to take into account the various complaints people have about that game--namely the endless grinding of Paragon Levels. Unfortunately is too far up their own bottoms to understand where and why they are failing but with any luck, even the most diehard fans of the game will leave it eventually and the company as a whole will be brought down.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc987cc13f6a</div><div class="date">2017-02-16, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The design thinking for these decisions are fundamentally flawed.<br />
<br />
It does not help us reroll spec or alts. Instead of being able to fill all 3 specs at AL 54 AND one spec on an alt, | or a spec on 4 alts | I would now have to pull all the same resources into one single spec. <br />
<br />
Surely you wish the difference to be smaller, but don't try to hide you quadrouble the effort required. <br />
<br />
So a new player returning suddenly face an immense grid. But again the thinking is flawed. New players can also be non-casuals. If there are casms of difference between the top raiders, and the ones who wish to catch-up, they will simply not be hooked. Like it or not, new players should be able to achieve the previous raid tier of gear within a month, like wotlk, to be hooked. This is the largest complain of the AP system, and it's only further enhanced now. Four times. Four. <br />
<br />
Had the AP been left untouched, people would have an easier time to reroll specs, alts and new players would have an easier time to catch up. But it's not. It's increased four times. <br />
<br />
There are thousand of ways to increase the artifact power without creating gabs or required farming. Because that is what it is now. This is what it will be in the future. Required. Aslong as you have a desire for top mythic content, you are forced to do tons of redundant unchallenging content to farm you better - because it is required. It's as much required to max farm AP, as it is required to use potions and food in raids - optional, but required.<br />
<br />
You can't change the mentallity of a player to not have it feel required, but you can warp the content so it's not a wall that makes people drop the game on the prospect alone, or leaving those who achieve it without a soul anymore. And the start, is to NOT quadrouble the time required to reach it. Rollback this change and find another solution.<br />
<br />
Good solutions: <br />
- Increase AL but not AP - so we can get AP done and focus on alt or offspecs<br />
- Share AP and not just AL by some percentage<br />
- Give capped character's AP to an alt instead<br />
- Make characters able to transfer all their AP at a ~90% cut to another spec, or maybe even character.<br />
<br />
But wait, all of this requires you didn't quadrouble the AP required. <br />
<br />
P.S. That the community evalutate AP needed in MoS is the HUMAN way of relate to a grid of this size. I feel it only becomes astonishing because it's over 1000 runs, so GJ on x4 -ing the grind, Don't see it as a flaw, we do it for every single challenge the game provides.</div></div><hr />

To put simply: Why do you pay? (No, you are not paying for servers..D3, Overwatch, HS, SC2, HotS running on servers as well and no monthly fee for them...for the updates and patches? Every normal game release fixes and hell even content patches for free...or in DLC form, but that cost a lot less than what we pay for an expansion and per month..)</div></div><hr />

I do my Cache, raid NH, LFR NH, run around 10-15 mythic pluses(+5-9) a week since AK25, AND IM ONLY at 43. If you are truly 880-885 geared, because you said you are raiding normal, and artifact 54, I'd like you to prove it. Because, I truly don't believe it.<br />
<br />
My brother is AK 54 on both of his DH artifacts, he doesn't run raids or do M+ often, mostly just one M+/week for his chest, and has only done EN 1-2 times. he just does every single AP WQ That pops.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't understand everyone complaining about AP burnout, you get AP for just about everything you do - why are people going out of their damned way to get it? They design encounters based on the 34 traits in an artifact, not 54, you don't need a max-level weapon to effectively raid.</div></div><hr />

My character I am talking about is aarreder on dalaran check out my profile, I don't get why anyone would doubt that this was easily accomplished in fact within a week after getting my mainspec to 54 I got both alt specs to 35 again not grinding M+ dungeons, I basically throw all my tokens i get in normal gameplay to my second spec and am i think 38 or 39 on it now without trying as I did with my 54 on primary spec.</div></div><hr />

I don't M+ very often, my highest i've ever done was a +10 the other night. Since I started playing, I try to do my AP WQs every single day, only missing the odd days. I hit rank 54 with under 50 m+ dungeons done ( according to wowprogress ) back on Feb 4th<br />

I started playing Legion a good week behind it's launch, so I wasn't one of the first people in my guild to hit rank 25 either. On a good day I'd get almost 2 million AP if I got a good mix of world quests, an AP item from an honour level up and daily dungeons etc</div></div><hr />

I guess there is enough mathematic around to get a graph pointing out what a good increase per week should be as well as how much a dungeon boss should return.<br />
<br />
I still do not understand why a RAID boss still is less rewarding then endlessly doing the same shit... at least on mythic difficulty a boss should reward tons more AP then a complete M+0 run as a raid boss only exists once a week, needs strategy, a larger group, more preparation, and also takes for the first kills more time then these 10-20min M+X runs. I really would like to see this increased so a Raid gets the AP by raiding and not by farming endless shit... I even can not see dungeons anymore, and only 1 will come in the near future. I did more dungeon runs I did in LK + Cata + MoP + WoD together ( just guessing) - nearly 100 m+ on NL ... I can not understand why the game should reward boring stuff. A raider is forced to do this shit over and over again :-( does not really feel good.<br />
<br />
I do not know anyone who likes the current system which is like an endless grind... and the next grind comes up... if this is the only method to keep players active, then maybe find more rewards then this... also that AP system breaks the feeling you have when &quot;something&quot; drops... its like &quot;oh no again this ring&quot; - just a roll higher would have been better... and again and again... and then this point when you get something after 100 m+ which is better as a fucking Mythic Endboss kill... WTF :-( <br />
<br />
I don't feel it's balanced. The post sounds it's going in a direction to think about it, but it also sounds somehow like &quot;you need to do even more to compete with others which have more freetime... (but less skill)&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm 30, how old are you? Having been a legal adult for a bit less than half my life and handling my own economy since I was 15, I'm quite capable of realizing that WoW is one of the cheapest forms of entertainment there is. However, &quot;value of a service&quot; is subjective in itself when concerning something as subjective as entertainment, something you should know if you're an adult. If you're going to act superior, at least show some proof of actually backing your attitude up. I've been getting amazing value for my money from WoW for 9 years. YOU (or others) not seeing value in it is quite frankly fucking irrelevant to me. <br />
<br />
And if you don't understand the difference between D3, OW, HS, SC2 and HoTS from WoW, that's an entirely different issue. If I enjoyed those very different games more than WoW, I would obviously play them instead. Meaning they have less value to me than WoW @ 50 cents per day. Not to mention that people can spend more money on games with micro-transactions in a month than they would on a subscription-based game, but if they think it's worth it I'm not arrogant enough to judge unlike some.<br />
<br />
The fact that you (and others that I assume to be adults) try to make 50 cents per day out to be this ENORMOUS waste of cash because it's spent on something you might not enjoy however, is pretty damned alarming... How tight on cash must one be to think that the price of 1 month's WoW access is outrageous on principle and that only F2P with micro-transactions out the wazoo is viable...?</div></div><hr />

Here's how I think the system should work (as if what I think even matters):<br />
<br />
1. Artifact power should be applied to all artifact weapons on a character, regardless of spec. Alternatively, 50% of the AP you put into your active spec should go into your inactive specs.<br />
<br />
2. Artifact power should only apply to the first set of unique traits in a weapon, not to scaling bonus once traits are maxed. Have the % dmg/stam scaling be leveled via a maximum of 2 content-gated tokens (for 1% bonus) per week.<br />
<br />
3. Make these content-gated artifact trait tokens come from optional sources (i.e. 1 from weekly M+ chest, 1 from final raid boss, 1 from winning 4 BGs, 1 from clearing 4 mythic dungeons, 1 from the weekly Dalaran quest such as timewalking, etc.). Want to get your weekly +1% dmg/stamina from 2 tokens? Go kill Kil'jaeden, go clear 4 mythic dungeons, go loot your Mythic+ weekly chest, or whatever you want to do. Do this weekly for 10 weeks and your character's artifact weapons will be maxed out.<br />
<br />
4. Players still have titanforged gear to &quot;grind&quot; M+ for if that's what they want to do, but the infrequency of it relative to artifact power grinding would make it feel like less of an obligation and more of a choice.</div></div><hr />

AP has to be account wide in a way or another, rerroling should no more be punished to have more tanks and healers in the queue.<br />
<br />
We have had a shortage of tanks and healers before Legion.<br />
That isn't the issue.<br />
See how guild recruitments are just the opposite, seeking DPS.<br />
<br />
It being wider has a problem.<br />
On the one character, is it split and therefore worse off for those with more specs and better for those with less.<br />
<br />
On multiple characters I would argue as a catchup it is faster than any we had before, such as the improvement to quest drops during WoD ring progression which were simply not on a scale remotely similar to the increase artifact knowledge can offer.<br />

I would say there's a large proportion of casual players who are simply happy with anything that makes raiders upset, because they believe that fun in WoW is a zero sum balance and buy into the fiction of WoD having &quot;catered to&quot; raiders on hand and foot rather than simply raiders managing to not get screwed quite as hard as everyone else.

seriously just end the AP grind already, at least for those with 54 for their specs to free them up from their spec (torture chamber) n allow them to invest into the remaining 2 specs they might want to try out.<br />
<br />
bring back valor upgrades if there is a need for players to feel slight power upgrade.<br />
<br />
blizz is impressive at delivering no results n be completely ineffective , in the end this announcement and their future plan fixed exactly nothing and the problem will continue to persist.<br />

I sincerely doubt that's the case since Warlords of Draenor was fairly casual friendly. Virtually everything could be done through your garrison and I don't remember anything other than Archimonde being close to &quot;challenging&quot;--the same can't be said for Legion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have a stacking on daily world quest chests of 3 days--I don't see why the same couldn't be done for weekly content-gated tokens. Maximum loot of 2 per week, with it increasing to 3 or 4 in the next week if you only looted 1 or none the previous week. The benefit of a cap is players are rewarded for playing a patch, rather than making them feel obligated to grind out in preparation of a patch. Look at ICC where Paragon killed Lich King HM prior to anyone having Shadowmourne; top players aren't pushed into hard grinding and the more casual players have a stable, time-convenient stacking buff that slowly assists them with clearing content.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Penalises any player that isn't a demon hunter with only two specs, unless you duplicate the result at which point it is unfair to anyone who isn't a druid.<br />
<br />
Then have it be 100% into current spec and 50% into both inactive specs and specs on your other characters. Anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Simply another cap with the expectation that you meet it.<br />
<br />
Hardly asking players to meet much by winning some BGs, arenas, running a M+, running some mythics, etc. If you have 5-7 options to obtain and token and only need 2 per week, it's very reasonable. A cap that people are expected to meet is only a problem if it's tedious to obtain, but someone who runs BGs and arenas is going to get them from playing. Someone who raids is going to get them from running M+ and killing raid content. Someone who plays casually doesn't even need them, but could obtain them from regular mythics, pet battles, anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Though it offering some improvement with the variety of sources for each.<br />

<br />
I love to bash LFR, but not because it gives epics to people.<br />
I bash it, because it's an absolutely horrible experience (I only realized that once I stopped raiding and &quot;relied&quot; on LFR to see the raids).<br />
You get plopped into it on some random boss. Hit some loot pinata for 5 minutes and then *poof* you are back in Dalaran.<br />
<br />
How the F*** is that &quot;story presentation&quot; ?!<br />
<br />
If you want to see story presentation of an LFR like raid, take a peek at FF-XIVs 24man raids.<br />
<br />
On top of that, LFR makes you feel how crappy your character actually is. I am an ex mythic raider, so I know how to play my class. Seeing people pulling double of what I can do is disheartening. Why would I even TRY to play well, if no matter what I do, I will be so far behind that it won't matter anyway?<br />
This does not breed the wish to be better. It only breeds &quot;yah I can go afk / watch a movie. They will kill the boss for me&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ex-mythic raider doing 1/2 damage of LFR casuals? You must have went in underpowered and undergeared. Not sure why you would be disheartened with people pulling twice your DPS when you know you're severely undergeared. Also unclear to me why an ex mythic raider like you would take LFR meters seriously.</div></div><hr />

I pay monthly for this game, I like things to do on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
To be fair i never noticed that happening mostly because it went in 3 major groups giving people a few choices.<br />
<br />
First you had the Reset day group who did everything on Tuesday or Wednesday.<br />
Second you had the Weekend warriors who tended to do things on Friday or Saturday.<br />
Then you had the last minute group who where a conglomerate. that hit things up late Sunday or Monday.<br />
<br />
I have rolled with each of these groups in the past and even when I let things ride until the last minute, there where always people there for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know overwhelming ignorance is par for the course in this community but I find it astonishing that you could be that oblivious. This expansion is in no way directed at casuals. You have your seemingly endless grind for Artifact Power, random chances at getting a Legendary which may or may not be utterly useless, you're forced to raid to progress your professions and even the appearances/alternate colors of your artifact weapons require a stupid amount of work. World of Warcraft has never been more unfriendly to casual players.<br />
<br />
1) you're forced to raid to progress your professions - i admit i quit a couple months ago, did they add profession recipes in NH? when i was playing most you had to do was normal dungeons for base recipes, mythic dungeons for higher rank recipes<br />
<br />
as far as the rest of your post - that depends on whether you care about the rewards that are gated behind raiding or just want to have fun... i've got a couple casual friends who really like this expansion cause whenever they log in they can do a mythic / m+ dungeon which progresses their character someohow and have a chance to give them good (for their level) loot<br />
<br />
for me, at a point when i decided that i just dont have the time for farm 'required' for raiding i told my GM im quitting and havent logged into wow since</div></div><hr />

<br />
Short idea:<br />
<br />
Once fully unlocked, new artifact power for a specific item is only obtainable via Raid (LFR/Normal/Heroic/Mythic) and boss drop. LFR gives less AP than Mythic, but all in all it's more or less capped.... and somehow similar to the old valor points....<br />
<br />
this whole system is flawed...</div></div><hr />

Putting effort in this game is not worth it.<br />

So essentially someone comes in and goes &quot;Hey guys, I got a mythic + stone for x.&quot; will be basically met by crickets if it isn't first couple days after reset. That's a worse game design than we have now.<br />
<br />
It's a bit like people on welfare suggesting higher taxes. It's nice for the people on welfare, but the people giving the help, or to continue in the example, pay the taxes, are screwed over. I am in no doubt sure that if diminishing returns on AP goes through, there'll be a lot of top end guild who'll have to step down after next tier due to too much farming required.<br />
<br />
Besides that, there's still the gear you can get from M+ or the legendaries. Suggesting AP is the only reason people do M+ isn't right, the grind for AP lasts a couple of weeks for the people who really grinds it and then it's over.<br />

pretty much, the AP grind itself honestly isn't terrible. Yes the difference in throughput ended up being massive which should be fixed...The legendary game still to me is the biggest problem of this expansion.<br />

<br />
I'm not sure what else they have planned, maybe mythic+ AP nerf? Either way, the problem as they have described it, especially with HP is a huge problem and it's good to know that they are working on it.<br />
<br />
Nerfing AP from Mythics would not be a good idea. A lot of the lower gear players rely on being carry or it makes the group a lot easier. If they nerf AP gain form mythics I am pretty sure a lot of more gear players will no running help or run carry groups. I got carry on both my toons and I see no issue with that. You start off needing help from more gear plyers, they ran you thorugh mythics and you get gear now you can help others gear up as you are getting AP back. <br />
<br />
Is like why m+ 0 is actually harder than a +2 to +4 becasue it offers little to no reward for gear players to run +0. If AP is nerf from M+ it will just make it harder to new players to get better gear. Not a good game design.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Great change! Reducing AP from repeated M+ runs is a godsend!<br />
<br />
Both sides win on this. The casuals don't have to worry about getting left behind while the hardcores don't have to worry about running 1000 MoS on 4 alts to stay ahead of the curb.<br />
<br />
Casual are usually the ones looking for carry so no it will hurt them. Image if there are 50% less carry groups or a well gear tank no longer joining your group since he gets nothing out of it. Yea more people not able to complete m+ = more people complaining. Lot's of ppl stillr un m+ even though they outgear the level due to the AP power.</div></div><hr />

I believe indeed the biggest problem here is that the design is too complicated for a casual observer(or shitslinger) to comprehend.<br />
<br />
Let me list off some of the silly arguments against this move, in this very thread:<br />
<br />
1. It won't help my alts!! - LOL, really? You do understand that as AK builds(faster until you are caught up, for your alts, plus multiple catchup mechanisms) you, your alts, and your new characters will all end up at the MEAN. Mean means average. That means that your alts won't be nerfed because of this change. Ironically, this change is the exact opposite of what you believe, and in fact is one of the few changes that allow your alts to catchup. On top of that, Legendaries are gonna basically be tokens/nothing next patch(not confirmed, but highly likely) so now your alts will be near 100% of your mains on AP and legendaries in a couple of weeks after dinging, they will also have flying. You see, Artifact Knowledge increases the rate you learn AP, so your alts will be able to do in minutes, what took months before.......your other specs will be in an even better position.<br />
2. The game is catering to the hardcore - Really? Because the other complaint is that it is catering to the casuals. This change does not cater to either group. The hardcore will still be able to grind to get an increase over scrub n00bs, it will just be a smaller gap that can be achieved. Also, the grind will be longer than ever for them if they really want to get good, because new points are balanced around a mean AK. That means OCD &quot;people&quot;(trying not to use a pejorative here) who cannot stand not having the absolute max will have no end to their grind(good, screw them, this game is not designed around your bullshit, because your RL cannot understand that 1% increase is within the margin for error, the game will not make concessions for your raid leader) and n00bs will not be able to whine that they can't keep up and are gimped, because they are too freakin' casual to actually play the game, but too much of a millennial to understand why they don't deserve everything for free.<br />
3. I can't BELIEVE they are reducing maw runs, fuck that - You just don't like change. Check it, AP needs to be slightly valuable, to keep you playing week to week and to give you a reward for running RNG shit with no other reward. However, you shouldn't have to grind maw of souls for AP, ever. It shouldn't be that valuable. AK keeps it valuable for a length of time, then lessens its value. If you wanna run maw, run maw, but you will not get a 10% damage buff from it. Just play the mean unless your required to play more, otherwise you are inefficient. It's ideal.(PS: Your time spent halves its value roughly every 2 weeks)<br />
<br />
Anyway, just some quick thoughts. Oh, I could go on, but if you read each opinion, you got people that &quot;hate&quot; this for every conceivable wrong reason you can imagine, and I submit they just don't understand the basic concept of cyclical gating. If anything, Blizzard shouldn't put such complex concepts in a game with a community that can barely understand simcraft.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
i love how they are STILL ignoring the biggest problem with legion , legendaries.<br />
<br />
seriously just end the AP grind already, at least for those with 54 for their specs to free them up from their spec (torture chamber) n allow them to invest into the remaining 2 specs they might want to try out.<br />
<br />
bring back valor upgrades if there is a need for players to feel slight power upgrade.<br />
<br />
blizz is impressive at delivering no results n be completely ineffective , in the end this announcement and their future plan fixed exactly nothing and the problem will continue to persist.<br />
<br />
I absolutely love how they improved their communication n presence but if they refuse to fix problems they acknowledged (looking at you, legiondaries), in the end its all fucking pointless.<br />
<br />
I don't want to single anyone out, but this is the reply type I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
First, there is the assumption that legendaries will not be addressed. It's been made clear they will be, so inaccuracy or incorrect assumption number one(FYI, with the legendary tokens in the PTR, my guess is a timeless isle type system that lets you farm all your legendaries relatively quickly, but we will know more soon).<br />
<br />
Second, the legit opinion that the AP system should be moved back to the valor points system with a weekly(or daily) hardcap. That's a fair opinion, nothing wrong with that, but it does fail to address the negatives with that system which were cloudily outlined in the OP(but which do exist and are many, I won't bore you with them, but PM me if you want a list of why that hard cap system isn't ideal in the game today).<br />
<br />
Finally, he doesn't say this outright, but I get the feeling that most people believe that this will hurt the ability to play an alt or alt spec. In reality, this change(with its not-linear time based scaling) is really the optimal way to create a universal catchup mechanism for your alts and allow you to reroll. All your toons will be at a mean AP, no matter when you roll them(because 1. Your alts have quicker ak than your mains and 2. There are 20+ levels of catchup to get them close to your main immediately)<br />
<br />
It's much ado about nothing, the change is vastly positive for alts and alt specs, and indeed will create an environment where one can reroll without consequence and catchup with only gear over the course of a few weeks.(assuming my legendary guesses are close to accurate, we will know soon)</div></div><hr />

Yea the issue we have now is that if you have a+2 key and try to hold a group most likely some people won't know what they are doing and they are a bit undergear which might not be enough dps/tank doesn't have have hp damage reducation or healers boing OOM or not enough HPS. and case a wipe. Worse might be even be able to complete the run. Having at least 1 to 2 over gear in the group it makes the run a lot smoother. Is like heroics having a higher level gear party allows more mistakes to be made.</div></div><hr />

It's impossible to be undergeared for a +2 unless you just hit 110. You'll be fine in there with a group of 830s. My DH is in 860 gear and all he's done is world quests, the world bosses, and a few LFRs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They lost it long time ago. Just look at this flying mess. They have no idea what they want. You either design the world and future worlds for flying, making for example flying dangerous, so you have to choose if you want to fly and take a risk or use ground mount. OR you dont have flying mounts at all and just design the world for ground mount. But they have noone at the team that can take a real decision they listen to much to the community.</div></div><hr />

are u retarded ? blizz do not deserve any benefit of doubt at this point, the expac is already about to end in the next 1-2 tiers and glaring issues are still not fixed.

The examples are endless because the rule is almost universal. What on gods green earth is the logic that allows you to even consider, let alone implement anything that handicaps people who invest more time at the expense of much more enjoyable things?<br />

The grind to 54 disgusted me. It was painful. Yet I put off things I should or would rather do because I'm a comitted and competitive raider. So as has been the blizzard mo for years, might as well play casual because sacrificing anything to make a hardcore investment just doesn't pay off in their world.</div></div><hr />

If you're a competitive raider, you have to spend hours daily for character &quot;maintenance&quot; and eventually got sick of it. I just want to log in, raid, log out because that is what I like to do in this game. But no, this expansion has artifact power, mythic keystone dungeons, world quest/emissary system, and RNG legendaries, all of which compound the time needed to maintain your character on top of the time spent for raiding. No wonder so many hardcore raiding guilds are moving more casual. Obviously, Blizzard wants people to have a reason to keep playing the game during the &quot;no-new content&quot; months, but the content is just very grindy and isn't fun to me. And, this new change is just making it harder on the hardcore players who just want to get their grind done and over with so they can enjoy their raiding experience. And, for the somewhat hardcore, somewhat casual players, it means there's no end to the daily, boring grind that is World of [RNG, Quest, Dungeon]-craft.</div></div><hr />
