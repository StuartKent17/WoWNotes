Blue Tweets<br />
If you've bought the transmog appropriate to your armour class from the Barracks, will that translate to all amour classes 1/2<br />
No. Each armor set from the Garrison Barracks must be acquired separately. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/697244535605178368))<br />
<br />
Just to confirm: Patch 6.2.4 DOES NOT remove the moose?<br />
Correct. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/697245269516156928))<br />

<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
You have to know there are people who ask you questions who're trying to get you to dis WoW so they can then use that against<br />
Yep. I get that. But I'm out of the loop enough that I can't offer much insight into current WoW decisions anyway. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694166952143552512))<br />
<br />
So then you agree that homogenization missed the mark? You said you don't apologize for it, but it didn't address utility.<br />
I think &quot;bring the player&quot; was the right call. That opened up group slots for people. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694241241857286144))<br />
I think we were too sensitive to &quot;Imma be sat cuz my dps&quot; concerns, which led to some of the class design convergence. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694241357078999040))<br />

What if they're not orbs, but the eyes of slain beasts? From this angle it looks like they've got faded iris' / pupils ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a fairly repetitive looking set, to say the least. The orb-encased-in-spikes look has been done to death in WoW. Monks often get some of the most uninspired looks ever. This set looks like the artist was bored and doing it in their offtime.<br />
<br />
And, honestly, what monk would have all those spikes and bells hanging off their shoulders? That looks like an entirely cumbersome and loud outfit. They really need to stop doing the same old, same old with monk sets. Monks should not look exactly like other classes. They should look less armored - not more armored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Least on the bright side is that you have the option to hide your shoulders in Legion. If you think about it I think the set would look better without the shoulders altogether.</div></div><hr />

I agree. I also think the armour design in general has become far too busy in detail and generic in the overall appearance. There's one or two interesting sets every tier, but rarely have I been wowed by a set lately.</div></div><hr />

He wouldn't be 'talking about wow' if mmo didn't keep 'letting' him (ie posting his 'talk' on here).<br />
<br />
BTW how is his 'talk' collated?<br />
Is it interviews from 6 mths ago, 1 year ago, 2 weeks ago?<br />
Interviewed for 1 hour every 2 weeks or how?<br />
Genuinely curious how mmo collects his thoughts.<br />

Over what time has GC's talk about wow been collated?<br />
Seems to be a lot of info that mmo has collected and being posted.<br />
Bit like a drip at the hospital.<br />
Gradually.<br />
Only thing is, will it cure the sickness.<br />
Sickness being people who like reading his thoughts and couldn't live without them.<br />

Based on real life humans all sets of all classes look crap since they are all impractical. Every single one of them for every class. Even the rogue ones.</div></div><hr />

They are resent tweets. If you click on one of the links (white text) it will take you to the tweet. The first question he answers are from the 31st of January</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whiteboard</div><div class="date">2016-02-16, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a fairly repetitive looking set, to say the least. The orb-encased-in-spikes look has been done to death in WoW. Monks often get some of the most uninspired looks ever. This set looks like the artist was bored and doing it in their offtime.<br />
<br />
Hunters would like to have a word with you about who has the most boring and uninspired tier designs since Vanilla's launch. I'll happily trade! Monks can wear their foes for yet another tier of uninspiring earth tones and teeth and bones, and Hunters will wear the colored orbs.</div></div><hr />

It's sad that not even the Challenge mode set is as good as it could be with the terrible helm.</div></div><hr />

Too much work. Blizzard only designs shoulders, helmets, and belts, texture on anything else costs a raid tier and battleground.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that's spot on. I dont really recognise the substance of the sets most often. I would love to see some TRADITIONAL cloth/leather/mail looking armor!<br />
Same with weapons. Last 3 expansion was full of STONEWORKS products, weapons were rarely looking like they were created from metal.<br />
Man, why trash the classic style? Im ok with some tier being crystal/alien/rough/oriental inspired but please do some real classic knightly-highfantasy stuff too...<br />
<br />
It will not be a problem with the artifact weapon design tho...</div></div><hr />

That is A monk set. Sadly every good artist have already left the Blizzard. They have 0 ideas and give a fu**k about their customers' ideas. <br />
There is only one thing in their head: money money money what a shame.</div></div><hr />
