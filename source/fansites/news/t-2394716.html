Battle for Azeroth Pre-Expansion Patch PTR Soon™<br />
As for the prepatch on PTR it should be soon™. When that happens you'll see the PTR forums go up and likely an announcement for it too. Keep in mind we're still around three and a half months out from Battle for Azeroth hitting live servers so there's still some time!<br />
<br />
<br />

Mistweaver Monk Feedback<br />
Using Enveloping Mist while channeling Soothing Mist with TFT active eats a TFT charge. This shouldn't happen.<br />
Quick note--the TFT-Enveloping buff has a new instant heal component added on beta, which you still benefit from if you TFT-Enveloping during Soothing Mist. While this loses part of the value of the buff, it's still a reasonable option to provide for when an instant heal seems important.<br />
<br />
All that said, one concern with the current setup on beta is that TFT-Renewing might dominate the other uses of TFT too often. Some of the exact bonuses it provides may have to be adjusted once everything else settles.

Druid Travel Form and Consent<br />
Thanks for bringing this up. It would definitely be ideal for you to be able to have control over something like this, so even though there's not an immediate solution, I wanted to say we appreciate you making what might have been a difficult post.<br />
<br />
On live, you at least have the option of Glyph of the Cheetah for the ground case, and as you mention, ordinary Swift Flight Form for the air case. I know that's not perfect since you may prefer to use other appearances--as we try to add more avenues for character customization, I hope we can find a place for this kind of option on Travel Form.

Unholy DK Beta Feedback Thread<br />
Death coil being 40 RP is a bit concerning, but seeing as it's been changed it's likely it has been tested thoroughly.<br />
We increased Death Coil's cost during Legion because the spec had an overflow of resources. We'll adjust Death Coil's cost to what feels right for overall Rune/Runic Power income in BfA.<br />
<br />
Festering wound cap being reduced is ... interesting, but important to note that Festering Strike now only gives 2 wounds (seemingly)<br />
Festering Strike applies 2-3 wounds now, down from 2-4. Felt it was important to allow you to at least cast 2 consecutive Festering Strikes initially without fear of overcapping wounds. Max of 8 was kind of a lot, and I think only felt necessary because of Castigator, which added an amount and form of randomness to wound application/consumption that we didn't feel was overall more fun for the spec, which is why the talent is gone right now.<br />
<br />
The epidemic change (using RP) is wonderful! Definitely makes this competitive<br />
Giving Unholy a way to deal convert Runic Power into AOE damage, especially outside of Death and Decay windows was the goal here. This change to Epidemic hopefully flows better: DnD -&gt; Scourge Strikes -&gt; Lots of Runic Power -&gt; DnD ends -&gt; Epidemic.<br />
<br />
Corpse explosion is meh, could be okay if we end up producing a lot of ghouls/it's damage gets increased<br />
We thought the fantasy of Unholy being about summoning lots of disposable pets/ghouls was worth trying with this talent. The main worry with Corpse Explosion is that it'll be too dependent on Apocalypse (1.5 min CD) and Army of the Dead (8 min CD), so it's kind of not available often enough, and also might have to be too bursty. Separately tracking and timing your ghoul durations to line up with times when you need the AOE damage might be tough. Gonna keep an eye on this talent and see how it goes.<br />
<br />
Bit sad Valkyr is going, but not surprised since it aesthetically didn't fit the theme of Unholy.<br />
We were pretty split internally on Gargoyle vs. Val'kyr. Gargoyle is kind of more classic WoW Death Knight from Naxxramas and Val'kyr is the slightly newer WotLK Arthas Death Knight. We thought Gargoyle fit Death Knight as a playable class, a bit more.

Taloc - Heroic Uldir - 14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a Beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br />
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br />
<br />
Q: What character should I use to test the raid?<br />
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players' effective level to 120 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounter(s) being tested. <br />
<br />
Q: How long does testing last?<br />
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we're satisfied that we've received that information for a given boss, we'll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.<br />

Battle for Azeroth Preview: Zuldazar Visitor’s Guide<br />
Located deep in the Zandalar subcontinent and nestled in a primal jungle, Zuldazar is a remnant of the once-mighty Zandalar empire. Join us on a brief tour through the oldest city in the world and the majestic land that surrounds it, and get a glimpse of the flora and fauna that dwell in this ancient domain. <br />
<br />
High above the jungle canopies, the Golden Throne serves as Zuldazar’s city center, with some of the most breathtaking views in the region. It is from here that Rastakhan, king of the Zandalari, rules. A vast, ancient cityscape of interconnected terraces sprawls out below, dotted with temples devoted to the loa, which are maintained by their loyal servants.<br />
<br />
Welcome to Zuldazar. <br />
<br />
Things aren’t as they should be in the great empire. The land is charged with dark secrets, and rumors of a rebellion swirl. As a representative of the Horde, you’ll need to earn the trust of King Rastakhan and the Zanchuli Council to gain access to Zuldazar’s resources and superior naval force. The Horde’s war efforts depend on it.<br />
<br />
Visitors can find anything they need for an extended stay in the heart of Dazar’alor at the center of the city. Facilities include an inn, portals to all major Horde cities along with Dalaran, profession trainers, a bank, training dummies, vendors, and more. It’s easy to get lost this ancient, multileveled city—but that only emphasizes its vastness and grandeur.<br />
<br />
Watch Your Step<br />
If you’re determined to explore the city and its surrounding areas, you’ll want to pack your walking shoes and bring a well-rested mount. There are thousands of steps throughout Zuldazar. Just be careful to keep an eye out or you’ll plummet into one of the many thunderous waterfalls surrounding the city. But the view is breathtaking!<br />
<br />
<br />
Things to Try: Take a ride on a Caravan Brutosaur! Trained to haul goods throughout Zuldazar, Brutosaurs offer a slow but steady ride around the city’s terraces.<br />
<br />

<br />
A Shrine to the Loa<br />
Worshipped as deities by the Zandalar trolls, loa are Wild Gods—or spirits of Azeroth. Many of the temples dedicated to these deities can be often found on high ground or mountain peaks, which are viewed as sacred ground by the devout.<br />
<br />
Did you know? Atal’ai means “the devoted ones” in Zandali.<br />
<br />
In the southern part of city at its lowest point, you’ll find the expansive Port of Zandalar. It is here that the Zandalari berth their mighty fleet and traders from around Azeroth sell their wares and services.<br />
<br />
For those of sufficient might (level 115) and have completed an introductory quest, Captain Rez’okun will facilitate access to Island Expeditions from the Expedition Map.<br />
<br />
The Savage Surroundings<br />
Zandalar’s rich tapestry of flora and fauna deserve research and cataloguing. The Zandalari have shown themselves to be able beast masters, having domesticated many of the creatures that roam the land. Some of these serve as helpful allies to the Zandalari; others prove obstacles to those who would seek to exploit the jungle’s resources.<br />

<br />
Tamed Ravasaurs, Brutosaurs, Pterrodax, and Direhorns make up just a portion of their menagerie. There are countless other wild beasts that make their homes in surrounding jungles, from Muddy Riverbeasts to Roaming Nibblers.<br />
<br />
Tortollan Knowledge Is Power<br />
Both inside the city and beyond its borders, you’ll encounter a new race: the tortollan. These ancient seekers are constantly in pursuit of knowledge and the acquisition of rare artifacts. They’re always in need of brave souls to help them acquire what they seek. Aiding them can be risky, but ultimately it will be worth your while to have these erudite people on your side.<br />
<br />
Where Kings Lie<br />
If you follow the Golden Road from the city and up into the mountains to the west, you’ll eventually reach Atal’Dazar. These ancient pyramids have served as the resting place for Zandalari kings for millennia. With each passing ruler, new rooms are constructed to house the deceased’s vast wealth.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/may/thumb/zulda6.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/may/zulda6.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
Atal’Dazar serves as the staging grounds for two new dungeons: Atal’Dazar (exterior) and King’s Rest (interior).<br />
<br />
A vast coastline surrounds Zuldazar to the south, east, and west, offering bountiful opportunities for fishing, boating, swimming, and treasure hunting. To the north, the marshland of Nazmir awaits exploration, offering plenty of opportunities to earn your way into the good graces of the Zandalari.<br />

Angels Fly at MDI's European Regional<br />
Week 3 of the MDI European Regional Group Stage kicked off with an immediate upset when the eighth seed, Games Revolted, knocked off the number one seed, Method in the first series of the tournament. This left Method with a tough path through the lower bracket for a chance at the regional final, and a seat at the live event on June 22. An improbable feat for any team, even one as talented as Method.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/may/thumb/MDI01.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/may/MDI01.jpg) <br />
<br />
Practice makes perfect<br />
Competition in Europe was very strong. Several matches came down to just a few seconds between team finishes, with some relying on the death deficit to decide the outcome. Sixth seed, Kjell’s Angels, managed to take out third seed Raider.io in the first round; first by mere seconds in Maw of Souls and again in Vault of the Wardens to take the series. Later Kjell ’s knocked out second seed Infinite in a reverse sweep by a 2-second margin in Lower Karazhan, despite Infinite’s 15-second death deficit. Finally, Kjell’s Angels crushed Method’s last chance at the Europe finals with surgical precision in Vault, the same map where they would go on to defeat Team Pogchamp for the tournament championship.<br />
<br />
<br />

https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/may/thumb/MDI03.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/may/MDI03.jpg) <br />
<br />
Sacrificing precision for speed<br />
Seat of the Triumvirate is easily the most challenging dungeon in the MDI, filled with tightly placed trash packs that pose the threat of pulling more than intended and unforgiving boss mechanics. In the China regionals, Skyline.D showed us that even though clean pulls and nearly flawless Seat runs are possible, it comes at the expense of time. Skyline.D and Kjell’s Angels’s death counts were similar, but Kjell’s managed to shave off more than ten minutes from their run.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sizing up the Composition<br />
Despite the peculiar compositions seen during the time trials, we expected the EU teams to bring traditional compositions, based on the first two regional events. Fatsharkyes and Method threw curveballs during their Upper Karazhan match by opting not to bring healers. Method deviated further from tradition by bringing an extra tank in the healer’s place. Unlike team No Healer from China, both teams had Paladins that switched to their healing spec for the remaining matches in the series. Method played this dungeon pristinely, but their damage output was considerably lower than that of Fatsharkyes, which ultimately cost them the match by four seconds.<br />

The stressed-to-bits little kid inside of me NEEDS to know the EXACT date for pre-patch, and if they'll make the Mage Tower available 24/7 at some point between now and BfA!!<br />
All this time and STILL I'm scrambling to get everything done... That's a good expansion! At this point in WoD, Cata and WOTLK I was more concerned with soloing old content or farming herbs.</div></div><hr />

Oh... oh my god. I... I don't mean to make light of actual situations where consent discussions should happen, but...I can't believe someone went there. I really don't want to see that whole thread.<br />

In game our avatars are a reflection of ourselves. What happens to them affects us as players emotionally on some level. So the fact that people can get on me without my consent is very unsettling, it's invasive. Maybe I’m overly sensitive given my own history but I wanted to put this out there and request some change so druids can have the forms they want and still be able to grant some form of consent. I understand the way its set up now it might not be feasible or practical, but at least think about it.</div></div><hr />

You guys just want to circlejerk to the hatred of internet/Tumblr bullshit feminism. If you read the post, the person is asking politely for Blizzard to consider a feature, because it is something that personally upsets them. There are no demands, they are just asking for consideration. That person has every right, just like every single person who purchases the game, to ask Blizzard to consider something. Blizzard gets bombarded with asanine requests for High Elves every week, so I think someone can make a post about something that also upsets them.<br />
<br />
It doesn't bother you? Great. Congratulations, you're normal. But don't pick on someone who is making a harmless post. It literally doesn't affect anyone else. It won't change druids for people. <br />
<br />
It's more than likely this person has past trauma or issues in relation to consent, so as far as I'm concerned they can ask Blizzard for a pop up message saying 'allow player to ride you?'. Seriously. Stop being jerks.</div></div><hr />

PAHAHAHHA. Man you must have some serious mental issues to make a thread about pixels riding other pixels.<br />
<br />
Jesus Christ that made me howl with laughter. I can't say I've ever met a Druid who I've had to ask for consent before jumping on them. Usually they just boot me off and I get on a mount. :)<br />
<br />
Some of the comments in that thread are pure fucking comedy gold though. I somehow think the comedy of that thread could be expressed through a Microsoft Paint drawing.<br />
<br />
I have the feeling that the OP of that thread on the forums has purple hair. Just a guess.<br />

If someone plays a druid, they know how travel form works. If they don't want to expose themselves to a risk of being triggered, then they don't have to. It's already possible to avoid entirely through numerous in-game means. Glyph travel form or use Cat. Or, hey, just use a real mount like everybody else. Options already exist. <br />
<br />
Requesting that developers make a change just to suit one person's fragility demonstrates a massive level of self-absorption. That's dickishness too, but maybe you can't tell from way up there on your moral high ground. Silly, frivolous topics like this make it easier for people to dismiss real issues of consent, which is incredibly damaging.</div></div><hr />

Holy shit.. &quot;Something happened to me, everyone needs to shape their products meant for millions of people with that in mind&quot;. Seriously, fuck off with this mentality. You want something changed, fine, but make that be about changes you feel would improve the game overall and not about your own fragility.</div></div><hr />

If you actually read the post, you would know the person does use cat form, and played before any of the travel forms allowed players to use them like vehicles. They have adjusted as necessary. I still say they are within their right to make a request to Blizzard. Don't confuse that with me saying that Blizzard should change Druids for this person. I am saying that the person has a right to make a request, and that people are dicks for essentially making fun of the person who is clearly asking out of personal trauma.<br />
<br />
If players can request High Elves, Raptor druid forms, Void Elf DKs, then someone can request for there to be a feature with druid travel forms. It doesn't mean they should win, but being ridiculed is too far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's the fact that instead of making a simple request, i.e. &quot;Hey, travel form/FF used to work like this, is there anyway we could get functionality like this again&quot;, they essentially made it into a SJW/PC/Safe Space issue. The request didn't need to talk about assault or consent to move it forward. There was plenty of good explanation for why they felt more control over their forms is a good change. Throwing all that stuff at the end just kind of turned it into &quot;xyz feature change would be great for player choice&quot; to &quot;xyz feature needs to be changed because it offends ME&quot;.<br />
<br />
And I don't disagree with the actually change to druid forms. As someone who used to play druid, consolidation of the various travel forms, while I understand Blizz's logic, wasn't the best path to take.</div></div><hr />
