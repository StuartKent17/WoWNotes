Yeah, we agree that having racials on the GCD isn't feeling great. Having to press multiple buttons in a row that don't do anything but increase throughput isn't particularly engaging. While we can resolve that issue within the context of a spec's toolkit, racials (as well as on-use trinkets) add an extra layer on top of that. So, in an upcoming beta build (likely next week), we'll be taking racials and on-use trinkets back off of the GCD.</div></div><hr />

It's not really though, and it makes sense. They've just literally had to put everything on the same playing field with the GCD and essentially go from scratch, determining what's fair and what's balanced. People are just pissed because it means they can't play like handicapped monkey's anymore pushing a few macros.</div></div><hr />

You can see what class abilities are on the GCD in Battle for Azeroth on the WoWDB beta site (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities?filter-on-gcd=1).<br />
Having to press multiple buttons in a row that don't do anything but increase throughput isn't particularly engaging. <br />
<br />
So they admit that putting throughput abilities on the GCD feels like shit. This same logic can be applied to every dps cooldown in the game they they put on the GCD. It is not engaging to hit 1-3 cooldowns in a row literally doing nothing for 3-4 seconds.</div></div><hr />

Isnt that what the *entire* GCD change does? instead of being able to macro these in various combinations I now have to press them individually. If they are taking racials and trinkets off the gcd why doesn't that make sense for ALL throughput CDs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I mean, right? How did that take so long?<br />
<br />
The second part is my favourite. &quot;While we can resolve that issue within the context of a spec's toolkit&quot;... That's what they should have done in the first place. All the GCD problems were caused by poor design choices for some classes, Warriors in particular. The whole DPS complexity in Legion is all about lining all your freaking CDs, consumeables, procs and artifact thingies together for a massive burst of damage, only to wait for the next minute or two not doing a lot until another moment comes. So yeah, instead of fixing annoying Battle Cry interactions that force you to do a ton of stuff within a few second window or so, they chose to globally mess everything up. So the weird bursty gameplay of the specs remains, but is just more annoying to play around, having to wait GCDs for every CD you pop.<br />
<br />
But hey, if they are making exceptions to a shitty rule, there's a chance they will just remove the rule in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Nah, it's really not that bad. Maybe some macros are broken but it's still quick gameplay. Not a useless change either if you read their logic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would hope so, especially lightforged because contrary to utility racials that stun, dispel, break cc or get you out of the fire (goblin rocket jump), lightforged racial has no utility, it's just to do damage, but it's actually worse than flat stat increase other races get. <br />
<br />
So if the guy in the Blizzard post complained that Orc blood fury is worse than if he was a Tauren and had 2% crit damage instead, this applies even more to lightforged, where pressing that button is often a dps loss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't it make more sense, then, to press one, DPS until it runs out, press the other, DPS until it runs out, press the third, DPS until that one runs out, wait for the first one to come back up, and repeat? :confused:</div></div><hr />

Um... it's a big difference removing racial abilities from GCD, than allowing you to use 'damage boost 1' + 'damage boost 2' + 'trinket' + 'ExtraActionButton1' (when available) macros for gigantic damage bursts.<br />
<br />
Racials aren't make-or-break. Insane buff macros can easily be.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is not engaging to hit 1-3 cooldowns in a row literally doing nothing for 3-4 seconds.<br />
But you are doing something. You are pressing cooldown buttons.<br />
<br />
Being facetious aside, I never liked the idea of blowing all CDs for massive damage... then do mediocre damage while waiting for the CDs to reset. If the CDs were supposed to be used at the same time, might as well just roll them up into a single buff, since it's basically the same thing, already.<br />

Buffs and debuffs duration are being adjusted for the GCD change. The Warrior's Battle Cry ability, for example, is 5 seconds on live, but 6 seconds on beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is the thing I don't think people understand, adding a GCD to abilities does nothing to address that. Since you pop your CDs in a sequence now you still do the massive damage at the end of the CD sequence then do the mediocre damage till the sequence is back up again. You were never going to just pop CDs at random downtimes in your rotation, it's always more benefit to stack CDs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is definitely an issue they should address. I always thought it was dumb that fury hit like a wet noodle outside of Battle Cry, and even weaker outside of enrage. No enrage or battlecry up is sooooooo painful. Fury is in a really bad place imo.</div></div><hr />

100%.<br />
they created a huge wall of negativity (that wasn't even needed)<br />
the long term health of the Game isnt going to be based around global Cd's but how the Classes are evolving<br />

No one is &quot;afraid of change&quot; I have beta. I can play all the classes and for some of them it feels pretty fucking bad.<br />
<br />
Prot Warriors have their active mitigation on the GCD<br />
Feral Druid has Tiger's Fury on the GCD and when you are specced Predator it is a button you are pressing ever 3-5 GCDS<br />
Fury Warrior has to press 5 GCDS in a row to use all of their cooldowns together.<br />

It's crazy how many things don't feel good on the GCD.<br />
It's like...like...this change is a mistake...hmmm...<br />

I played a ton of the classes on Alpha and Beta and I don't find any difference, but I never used macros for any abilities because I am not a pussy.<br />

No one is &quot;afraid of change&quot; I have beta. I can play all the classes and for some of them it feels pretty fucking bad.<br />
<br />
Prot Warriors have their active mitigation on the GCD<br />
Feral Druid has Tiger's Fury on the GCD and when you are specced Predator it is a button you are pressing ever 3-5 GCDS<br />
Fury Warrior has to press 5 GCDS in a row to use all of their cooldowns together.<br />
<br />
There is nothing 'new and scary' about it, it feels like straight dogshit.<br />
<br />
Some of these abilities like tigers fury are dated though, honestly they need to remove tigers fury I always found it annoying even as a Feral player.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jastall</div><div class="date">2018-05-11, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um... it's a big difference removing racial abilities from GCD, than allowing you to use 'damage boost 1' + 'damage boost 2' + 'trinket' + 'ExtraActionButton1' (when available) macros for gigantic damage bursts.<br />
<br />
Racials aren't make-or-break. Insane buff macros can easily be.<br />
<br />
<br />
But you are doing something. You are pressing cooldown buttons.<br />
<br />
Being facetious aside, I never liked the idea of blowing all CDs for massive damage... then do mediocre damage while waiting for the CDs to reset. If the CDs were supposed to be used at the same time, might as well just roll them up into a single buff, since it's basically the same thing, already.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffs and debuffs duration are being adjusted for the GCD change. The Warrior's Battle Cry ability, for example, is 5 seconds on live, but 6 seconds on beta.<br />
<br />
But the change doesn't resolve that at all. Using Fury as an example, we stack cooldowns because our base damage is utterly pathetic, the worst of any spec. Our damage becomes nuts with Enrage + Battle Cry + Unrivaled Strength + Frothing Berserker + Avatar + Bloodbath all chained. Only one of these is going away in BfA, so the spec will probably still at least rely on the Battle Cry (now Recklessness) window a lot, the magnitude of which will depend on which talents are best.<br />
<br />
But if, for argument's sake, the best talents remain the same, we're just going to make a cast sequence macro. Probably cast Avatar, then Rampage, then Recklessness, then Bloodbath, then actually get on with the burst after 4 GCDs. Seems utterly awful to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I gotta admit I prefer it that way, one of the reasons for that is that trinket CD isn't showing properly in the default UI, which I am using. I can't really see when they are off CD(at least certain trinkets), even though I have CD tracker enabled.<br />
<br />
One of my Antrous trinkets on my holy paladin can't be macroed(I have sent a bug report on that), and because of that I needed to keybind it and click it manually. I don't really feel how this is suppose to be more engaging? Sure you might be able to time the use of it better, but I am not clever enough to be able to properly track my trinkets that well, when they have different CD's(well, these days most seem to be rather equal), and remember to push it into my rotation manually. Yes, I could get used to it, but like I said above... In my opinion it doesn't add anything to the game.</div></div><hr />

You're assuming that the class will remain exactly like it currently does in Legion, only with the GCD change added on top of it. I haven't played Warrior in Alpha or Beta (and I have zero experience with Fury warrior), but considering the Battle Cry's duration was changed to adapt to the GCD change, I think it stands to reason the rest of the class (damage, mitigation, other cooldowns) have changed as well to reflect the new GCD rules.<br />

So far it hasn't changed apart from number tunings and adding a damage component to Bloodbath, and once we get to beta overhauls are unlikely. If they do change the spec so that it is less burst dependent (such as making Inner Rage baseline as they should have done since early Legion and reduce Enrage/Recklessness's impact) then we'll see. I still think the change is stupid in PvE in and of itself.<br />
<br />
And you don't seem to understand my second paragraph. We'll still stack cooldowns because the spec simply doesn't work otherwise. The stacking will just be more annoying to set up as it will be spread over 3-4 GCDs and far more likely to be ruined by some random raid/dungeon mechanic or another which will feel absolutely terrible.</div></div><hr />

Firstly blizzard said even though we were in beta they had not finished changes on Dks or Fury warriors. We have bow seen the DK changes but not yet the fury warriors.<br />
<br />
Secondly buff stacking is exactly 1 of the reasons they brought in the GCD changes. They do not want classes to have a big burst every min or whatever they want you to spread your cooldowns out across a fight to add some thought as to &quot;which one should I use now&quot; rather than ill pop everything.<br />
<br />
Whether you like that idea or not is moot as Ion has confirmed that is what they are going for and that was confirmed in the recent Q&amp;A.<br />

Well considering how much of a ruckus a fair portion of the community were in with this GCD business..

the wall of negativity was pretty small IMHO. just a few people afraid of change.<br />

I agree with you. I feel this change is for mostly pvpers. Putting these big CDs on the GCD will actually give players time to react to them instead of getting getting shredded by swifty macro's.<br />

<br />
I can't accept the reasoning that we should just wait and hope they un-fuck what was my favorite spec in Legion in the name of some silly change that doesn't actually bring much to every other spec beyond waiting a bit more and calling it a good thing. It took them months to address some of Fury and Arms's issues in early Legion, and these changes primarily came with item and artifact effects that are going away. I really don't want to have to wait months once again for my spec to play properly. <br />
<br />
Also, if they don't nerf cooldowns, the classes and specs that stacked them will still stack them. Because they usually did so given that the additive effects of both cooldowns were superior to using them on their own, such as chaining Pillar of Frost with Obliteration. The only difference is that the Frost DK will now waste 2 globals pressing these two buttons, then resume what they previously did. It might be Blizzard's wish, but it will clash in the face of reality as it has done several times. <br />
<br />
And I still don't see the problem with cooldown stacking. Who the hell cares? Some specs did it, other specs didn't. If you find that some specs rely too much on it (which I agree with), solve these problems on a case by case basis. Don't slap this GCD on everyone, then scramble to make exceptions left and right as players (and apparently Blizzard) discover that it brings nothing to the table and changes nothing on how burst heavy specs will behave besides a longer setup time that leaves more room for being utterly punished by mechanics or RNG because you need to use 3-4 GCDs popping cooldowns and your defensive/mobility tools are sometimes unavailable during this time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thirtyrock</div><div class="date">2018-05-11, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far it hasn't changed apart from number tunings and adding a damage component to Bloodbath, and once we get to beta overhauls are unlikely. If they do change the spec so that it is less burst dependent (such as making Inner Rage baseline as they should have done since early Legion and reduce Enrage/Recklessness's impact) then we'll see. I still think the change is stupid in PvE in and of itself.<br />
<br />
And you don't seem to understand my second paragraph. We'll still stack cooldowns because the spec simply doesn't work otherwise. The stacking will just be more annoying to set up as it will be spread over 3-4 GCDs and far more likely to be ruined by some random raid/dungeon mechanic or another which will feel absolutely terrible.<br />
<br />
But you're not talking about an overhaul. That's just tuning. Tune up base damage, tune up each of the buffs then you have a spec that feels decent in any of the individual CD time periods, without needing them stacked to do great damage. If you still choose to stack them you lose DPS overall because you waste so many GCDs. Instead you strategically use them based on procs and other buffs, or situationally.<br />
At least, that's my understanding of the plan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The GCD is going to be used up on them regardless, so that's hardly a good argument. <br />
<br />
After that whenever you want to stack them also depends on their individual cooldown times. So at best the ''strategy'' will be to punch your CDs as soon as they come up instead of waiting for them to be both up at once so you can stack them (like some specs already do). Trying to weave cooldowns around procs is often way too risky and reliant on the RNG, especially in a M+/raiding scenario where you often want to use them at specific times. How most specs approach their cooldown usage will not change, it will just be slower and less satisfying for no real reason, and the simple fact that Blizzard has already added plenty of exceptions with the reasoning that pressing several CDs in a row feels bad (no shit sherlock) to me shows that they know it's a shit change and are just trying to lessen the blow. <br />
<br />
As for Fury, again, we'll see if they do some drastic tuning to make Enrage and Recklessness matter less, but I rather doubt they will do that on time. Like in Legion they might just finally decide to change things after months of complaints on live.</div></div><hr />

It's amazing how many things they are so cocksure are great &quot;don't work out&quot; or &quot;don't feel good&quot; even though they were told over and over again these things in advance.</div></div><hr />

You can see what class abilities are on the GCD in Battle for Azeroth on the WoWDB beta site (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities?filter-on-gcd=1).<br />
Yeah, we agree that having racials on the GCD isn't feeling great. Having to press multiple buttons in a row that don't do anything but increase throughput isn't particularly engaging. While we can resolve that issue within the context of a spec's toolkit, racials (as well as on-use trinkets) add an extra layer on top of that. So, in an upcoming beta build (likely next week), we'll be taking racials and on-use trinkets back off of the GCD.<br />
<br />
Racials out of cops Global cooldown. Great, does it mean blacks will now have 1 less second to escape before getting shot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Question form someone who hasn't played in years: for how long _have_ these been on the gcd?<br />
<br />
yeah, I have stopped playing during Tomb, but regularly visit here, read the newspost and was superconfused wtf is going on and coulndt actually believe blizz would jump the shark and put boost CDs back on GCD, that is even more backwards logic than when they destroyed the couple of spells that were castable on the move only to wonder, why people were stacking melee/hunter on some heavy movement fights...<br />
<br />
I always try the new expansion, but just the idea of noninteractive cds being on GCD is so offputting that I might reconsider BfA Afterall</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RussW210</div><div class="date">2018-05-11, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you. I feel this change is for mostly pvpers. Putting these big CDs on the GCD will actually give players time to react to them instead of getting getting shredded by swifty macro's.<br />
<br />
I watch a legion vid where CDew was killed in 3 seconds from 100% by an Arms warrior.<br />
<br />
I welcome the change<br />
<br />
Exactly my thinking. And some classes (warriors) benefit from those swifty macros a lot more than others. Makes the game hard to balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you right, vanilla was like this, everything was on GCD.<br />
<br />
They just need to get used to not be able to 1 shoot ppl like they used to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then just make it a PvP exclusive change. They already have the tech to do it. Don't piss on the PvE gameplay with a sweeping change that they will spend the entire expansion fixing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">f3llyn</div><div class="date">2018-05-12, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They never said that. They said that major class changes (things like overhauls) are pretty much done. They will still tweak talents around and add/remove stuff as they think is necessary or that is predicated upon feedback.<br />
<br />
And what fury needs to work within the confines of these gcd changes is a rework.</div></div><hr />
