Yeah I'm sure between coding the azerite gear fixes and creating new raid tiers, the same dude writes some stories during his coffee break. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I'm sure the storywriters are the one doing the Azerite stuff right? :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I mean I ain't keen on Azerite as much as the next person but this is just complaining for the sake of it rather than actual criticism.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me the lore goes up and down. One minute it's pretty decent then next it just goes to shit because no effort was put in.<br />
<br />
Like Broken Shore. 14 weeks of &quot;story&quot; and the only actual story was at the end. And in Cathedral of Eternal Night in a way.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyphael</div><div class="date">2019-01-07, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this going to finally be the end of faction lore war? Please discuss this. It's repetitive and the Sylvanas/Anduin soap opera is not compelling at all. I am still playing DESPITE that. Lack of interest in the game lore should show that. I know the game has &quot;WAR&quot; in the name but discuss how the faction war and faction leader conflicts are not very interesting to anchor a whole story. I know Azshara and N'zoth will be a major plot component, but it's taking too long to get there, and is it really worth players losing interest in your story to tell another faction war story?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2019-01-07, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dave Kosak: Sylvanas fanboy<br />
Alex Afrasiabi: Sylvanas fanboy<br />
Steve Danuser: Sylvanas fanboy<br />
<br />
My question would be &quot;who hired you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kosak left the Hearthstone team? News to me. I don't recall him ever being particularly engaged with Sylvanas, as a character, and was only the senior narrative designer on an expansion she played no part in. I would suspect Chilton or Brack hired him. <br />
<br />
Afrasiabi was most likely hired by Rob Pardo, Alex was in the same guild Kaplan was in, that got hired to work on vanilla. Afrasiabi is almost certainly responsible for most of the good content in the game since then. But don't let that get in the way of your irrational hatred for a fictional character. <br />
<br />
Don't really know much about Danuser, but it doesn't matter. You'll believe what you want, and force facts to fit your narrative. If you want to blame anyone for Sylvanas, blame Metzen, he wrote W3, where she first appeared. <br />
<br />
Me, I'm interested in this Q&amp;A to see where they're taking the story, if they reveal anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Ren'dorei could always use more soldiers, and the High Elf fanboys will finally shut their mouths. It's a win-win situation. Also, Vereesa is annoying and must be silenced.</div></div><hr />

Nathanos Blightcaller is literally his self-insert.<br />
<br />
If you want to blame anyone for Sylvanas, blame Metzen, he wrote W3, where she first appeared.<br />
You do realize there was a time when Sylvanas was well-written, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, is that who that guy is? I may pass now, that dude is creepy. <br />
<br />
And, i never claimed Sylvanas was poorly written. I was just pointing out that she existed WAY before any of the people that other person was complaining about wrote her storyline.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She is still well written, in fact, better than ever. She's more cold and calculating than ever. Great stuff. The dialogue sucks though. Dialogue does equal poorly written story.</div></div><hr />
