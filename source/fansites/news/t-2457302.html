I just don't care anymore, I am going to play on private servers because I own every version of the game that has existed and Blizzard will no longer get my money unless they really do something spectacular for the player base.

Uhm, that's still illegal. Not that you're gonna go to jail, not for something like that, but still, you might have bought the games, but this does not give you the right to play on illegal servers.</div></div><hr />

I give myself this right since they have not made every version of something I paid for available at all times. I am actually creating a document and association about software like this and hope it gets enforced since anything you pay for should be yours and should be provided a way to play it either through a subscription or emulation.</div></div><hr />

I can never take anyone seriously when they use terms like &quot;spit in your face&quot;, especially when it comes to a video game. So they didn't do what you wanted, boo hoo. Throwing a fit is totally the way to go about it.<br />

<br />
Yep and playing on those servers again is not illegal.<br />
<br />
It states nowhere in the ToS/EULA that you MUST play on official servers. Just that you are granted access to them.<br />
<br />
It is however 100% illegal to host them as it's their intellectual property.<br />

It states nowhere in the ToS/EULA that you MUST play on official servers. Just that you are granted access to them.<br />
<br />
It is however 100% illegal to host them as it's their intellectual property.<br />

Apparently downloading it is though, I remember receiving an email awhile back while still playing the retail version and downloading a private server version in the background and we got an email from our internet provider and blizzard entertainment (I'm in Canada also). So even though was a stupid way to do it, the fact of the matter is if they catch you apparently it is illegal.</div></div><hr />

Activision-Blizzard dances to the tune of the stock market now, why would they send an email addressing all of their failures right before an investor call? Don't expect Activision-Blizzard to do anything for us out of the goodness of their hearts or their love of games anymore, just pray that the suits up top give the devs the budget and the creative freedom to make something decent in the worlds we used to love.</div></div><hr />

No, everyone is legitimately upset with how shitty things have become with one of their favorite companies and this is like a spit in your face if you are pissed off.<br />

You don't actually own anything. Try reading the terms you agreed to when you first launched the game. You're bound to use THEIR software how they determine, not freely.</div></div><hr />

OMG a company cares about marketing their games! The horror!<br />

Also marketing and development are two entirely different sections of a company with two completely different budgets. You will know that when you get out in the real world and you care a little less about a video game company not doing what you want right NOW *stamps foot*.<br />

Doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
All WoW expansions are more than likely licensed as &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. Rather than their individual name.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the complete collection includes those expansions. It doesn't matter how much they changed. They are still sold just digitally.<br />
<br />
The complete collection consists of Vanilla, Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King and so on.</div></div><hr />

This was objectively one of the worst year for Blizzard, so to see them claim it was a great year is obviously going to attract anger.<br />
<br />
There are times when it's better to say nothing.<br />
<br />
Definitely this. This year was one of the worst ever, especially as a WoW player where I feel beyond taken advantage of and the first time I truly just don't care anymore about a 14-year-old game that I have played for about 13.5 of those years. I have been only playing for my friends and guildmates, but even that is starting to wane over how awful the game is and how much Blizzard just keeps fucking me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great year for Blizzard&quot; = The year I will likely be quitting.</div></div><hr />

I don't play their games and have uninstalled all of them including the launcher and unsubbed, They will get no further support from me until they can prove they are worth supporting again.<br />
<br />
20 years and some 15k worth of money spent on supporting them and they turn it all to shit in the space of a few years, they want me back they now need to prove they are worth my support.</div></div><hr />

The sites called MMO-Champion NOT WOW-Champion plus people like to have other discussions and like myself mostly avoid anything wow related as Blizz can go fuck themselves, There are actual decent discussions on this site with like minded people be it about Other Games (I know fuck me right other games exist other than WoW) to life advice to politics so get the fuck over yourself as this site doesn't just cater to the random WoW pleb.</div></div><hr />

I mean, there are things they do that I donâ€™t like. I donâ€™t get any input though. I donâ€™t own the game. They do. They can do what they want with it. Once I stop enjoying it, I simply stop playing.<br />
<br />
I didnâ€™t even watch the video. Sounds like it is a company marketing to their consumers. That is how a business works. At least we arenâ€™t forced to purchase their products. Plenty of other options in the marketplace.<br />
<br />
Also, even though the player base doesnâ€™t feel it was a good year for Blizzard, it may have been one as a company. Their goal is to turn a profit. Maybe they did.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully you mean hobbyless, because if someone had their job being a competitive game that's fucking stupid. Even professional poker players or chess players have day jobs still.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Newsflash mr. man, every job is stupid unless it's one where you actually help people, like a firefighter, doctor or anything like that.<br />
<br />
This was like the NFL announcing overnight that they're disolving, putting thousands of people including athletes who train day and night for their entire life to get there out of an official job.<br />
<br />
Stop being so fucking obtuse.</div></div><hr />

I hope that in the future, they'll choose the path of creating great games, and not the path of bad cash grabbing games.<br />
It may not be the most profitable path for the immediate future. But I'm sure it will be in the long run.<br />
Gamers will be happier, blizzard wil have a better reputation and they can be proud of what they created. <br />
<br />
Keep the critique constructive and civil. <br />

Merry Xmas and a happy new year!</div></div><hr />

I feel nothing for Blizzard anymore. I still pay for the game because I've invested time and money into something I enjoyed for many, many years. I don't like when people say that you can't complain about a game and continue to play it. I was fine with the game in Legion. I enjoyed the other expansions. I'm not sick of the game. Blizzard (Activision now I guess) is changing internally and their games are going to reflect that. The game doesn't feel the same and a lot of people pick up on that. Like Blizzard called up a random company and told them to make a World of Warcraft expansion based on what they know about the game and they were like, &quot;??? Uh ???&quot; and BFA was born. Some people don't pick up on that or it doesn't bother them. That's fine. You can enjoy it. You can not enjoy it. That's your own choice to make. But I think everyone is also missing the point. People are bitching at other people just to bitch. If someone says &quot;I hate this game it sucks blahblahblah&quot; and someone else responds &quot;Top keks play a different game if u hate this one so much bye&quot; like you both suck lol.</div></div><hr />

A bunch of immature man-baby that booed because they didn't got the announcement they wanted, then started to try to take apart the little they knew about the game starting with the co-developer Blizzard chose, trying to paint as an shovel-ware gash grab company while they are one of the largest Internet and video game companies in the world (quote from wikipedia).<br />

Eh, Blizzard as a whole is really losing a lot of faith from its consumers. I know forums like this are an echo chamber of negativity, but I think the decline is hard to deny when two of their major IPs are tanking hard in the eyes of their fans. <br />
<br />
I will say good on Blizzard for still reaching out to its fan base with a happy holidays email. At the same time, I can see where the negativity stems from as well; fans are looking for more than PR at this point - their approaches need to change, the more quickly the better.</div></div><hr />

Bro, it's elitist (games journos agree with you) to call fans man babies. It's the devs job to understand the community and what they want. And yes, Diablo Immortal IS a shovel ware game that is a massive cash grab that is primarily aimed at the Chinese market place - this is because it will be PAY TO WIN. Mobile games are stupid and don't even appeal to &quot;casual&quot; gamers - they appeal to a completely different demographic entirely who make up less than 10% of all people who play games to begin with, and most of those games are puzzle or casino games. It's only going to do well in Asia and it's going to hurt the brand.</div></div><hr />

It's CS staff. A position which over the years in a lot of gaming industries has been downsized due to the fact a lot of support can be automated.<br />

That's the same in the end. At the moment, everything that comes from Blizzard is evil at first and is viewed very critically. In order for that to change, they first have to win back their lost trust. Then the people will react normally to such things again - the topic would be worthy no more discussion.<br />

Yes, some criticize this and others just criticize everything. That's human, I would say. Of course, too exaggerated, that's Internet ;)<br />

<br />
So, you're a bunch of greedy P's of S who totally disrespect your 'valued customers' (mostly casual players) who are part of your 'awesome, passionate community' of super toxic elitists. You louses with your microtransaction survey into South America, a place where mobile and console gaming is really the mainstay, so you can get fixed positive feedback for the go-ahead on your mtx scamming and development for your Chinese, Brazilian and Mexican markets. You vipers with your time gating (war campaign, allied race locking, reputation gains), forced scarcity (weapons, reward chest, azerite armor) and player-punishing tactics (you found a way to gain azerite more quickly? BAD, BAD PLAYER! SUSPENDED! WE STEAL BACK YOUR REWARDS!)... to keep people paying for playing WoW. And of course, how pathetic you were to create a franchise and then abandon it because you couldn't monetize it well enough for your corporate overlords and their shareholders.<br />

I was almost fascinated at first how some people actually seem to honestly like the latest blizzard garbage like Bfa. How could someone find enjoyment in something so bad and lightyears away from what the game used to be even 1 expansion before. But at the end of the day its just shit standards. Its people who like crap stuff like theres people who like and play other crap mmos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because he's garbage. Delaying flying, plus not to mention the crappy darkshore story that doesn't make sense. Then we are told that the Zandalari raid is suppose to be payback for Teldrassil. How tf is that making any sense when the nightelves would rather have help retaking darkshore then raiding zandalar. No nighelves are even taking part in that raid. Total BS. Honestly I hope Activision forces him , Ion and Danuser to leave. Also would like to see Lore leave, heck we no longer have to deal with Netherea anymore. Glad she isn't around anymore, her posts were annoying at times. <br />
<br />
Can't blame activision for how crappy the game is , thats all the devs fault. Rng,classes, time gating , no flying. Activision doesn't affect any of that. The devs are crying about there bonuses. With how this last blizzcon went, they don't deserve a penny of it. The only devs that deserve a bonus are the devs for SC2, HotS, overwatch, and hearthstone. Diablo and warcraft devs should have there salarys cut. Using the cuts from theres to add to the other game devs.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that this feels more like &quot;Thank you for giving us your money in a year where we absolutely ducked you up in every imaginable position&quot; rather than a &quot;Thank you for believing in us&quot;. This was objectively one of the worst year for Blizzard, so to see them claim it was a great year is obviously going to attract anger.<br />
<br />
There are times when it's better to say nothing.<br />
<br />
where in the video does it say &quot;thank you for giving us your money&quot; i didn't see that message i saw a celebration of all the blizzard franchises and a thanks to the fans for supporting them in one way or another, i didn't see store mounts and pets being shown off with &quot;BUY NOW RIGHT NOW 4200$ OF MOUNTS!&quot;<br />

I give myself this right since they have not made every version of something I paid for available at all times. I am actually creating a document and association about software like this and hope it gets enforced since anything you pay for should be yours and should be provided a way to play it either through a subscription or emulation.<br />
<br />
you cant &quot;give yourself the right&quot; that is not how the law works buddy.<br />
and no, you do not own everything you pay for.<br />
if you rent an apartment you do not own it, even though you are paying for it.<br />

<br />
It's illegal to host those servers.<br />
<br />
Not play on them. There is nothing in the ToU that states you MUST play WoW on their servers.<br />
Actually in technicality you are still pirating the game by downloading illegal versions of the client, its the same as emulating it is in technicality illegal, in the same way downloading movies and music is illegal. unlikely to get in trouble for it, but you can.<br />

For being a news-site there seems to be very few news. Not counting &quot;ANOTHER ROTATING BOSS THIS WEEK AND ANOTHER ROTATING WEEK EVENT!&quot; or &quot;another day, another hotfixes&quot; since they are not a news.<br />
<br />
This site is following WoW, if you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
really? they have been giving out TONS of news, but we literally JUST had the patch drop, so not much news coming in other then secrets being found... no new patch to start datamining yet or updates to discuss... so... i dont know what you are suspecting..?<br />
<br />
do you want them to make news updates about &quot;Oh this person who works on wow coughed, thats your news for the hour!'<br />

no, games do not get updates EVERY SINGLE DAY chill dude<br />

This website has very little to do with &quot;news&quot; since like the end of MoP, maybe even earlier.<br />
Each day a new main page thread is being made, with irrelevant &quot;news&quot; just to generate a few more adds, even though most of the visitors arent masochists and use adblock to protect themselves from this website... Or &quot;here's a summary of X. Ofc we already summarized it one week ago, back then it was summary of two other summaries, but click counts gotta be right&quot;.<br />
<br />
what do you call news then?<br />
if datamined stuff<br />
new patch data<br />
unannounced things<br />
bug fixes, changes, and class balance<br />
patch dates<br />
secret finds<br />
guides<br />
blue posts and updates<br />

It is slap in the face... Another one tbh.<br />

sadly its the lack of hots players that killed hots, not blizzards fault.<br />

i can make a game that 5 people super enjoy, and love it.<br />
but if only 5 people like it, and i need atleast 10 to be able to keep it online, is that my fault, or just &quot;well i tried, but not enough people want to play&quot;<br />

Last time blizzard did something about private server PROVIDER (mind you, not players) it was inviting them to their hq to discuss classic wow. Imagine what they could do to a single person !!!! The other guy is right.. probably jail time! :rolleyes:<br />

the dva and reindhardt cinematics were this year.<br />
reaper of souls was a few years, so was the hots cinematic, the burning crusade and vanilla ones much older..<br />

Thanks for the edit of random clips from old videos trying to make it seem like you still care about the players. I would rather have you actually communicate with the playerbase on the state of the company/games instead.<br />
<br />
To the people complaining about those such as myself that are criticizing Blizzard, YOU are the part of the problem. Acting as though everything is fine and dandy and blindly calling people that see the reality - a developer we all loved and grew up with gradually fading away into another corporate shithole of a company - trolls and idiots. Just stop.<br />
<br />
you mean like how they are, but people then cry saying they are lying or ruining the games?<br />
like how they talk about how hots is doing poorly and they need to draw back development on it, and then blizz is blamed for such?<br />
and no, people are not blindly defending them, people are going &quot;oh hey, they thank us every year, this one has alittle compliation of all their cinematics, cute, i love to be part of this community, even if i dislike the games, or dont even play some of them anymore&quot;<br />
<br />
people seem to act like to be a blizzard fan, you need to pay 100$ a month and dedicate 20 hours a day to wow and they are seeping the life from us.<br />
while forgetting blizzard has 3 free games, with all content open to all players, trials for almost all their games, and all of them you can earn everything ingame through one way or another, they have been devving for coming up on... fourty years i think? (if we count old blizzard like lost vikings and rocknroll racers)<br />
just because you do not like the current state of wow, does not mean &quot;ENTIRE COMPANY IS SHIT FUCK THEM&quot;<br />
<br />

go fuck yourselves with your money blizzard, thats all that matters anymore.<br />
<br />
that is all that has mattered since day 1. they are a company, they need to feed their employees, do you want them to develop for free?<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that Blizzard wastes money making cinematics for WoW instead of fixing the in-game issues should tell everyone their focus.<br />
<br />
They do not care about improving their game, they care about marketing it.<br />
<br />
you do know money doesent solve all problems right? <br />
if they have a cinematics team, and a development team, do you want them to tell the cinematics team they are fired, so they can try to hire a few more devs, which they have had job openings for, for along time, but its hard to find good enough people.<br />
or would you idk, tell them &quot;here make some stuff to populate the game!&quot;<br />

But yeah, we people that are actually up to date on such things are such sick haters that we're never Blizzard fans in the first place and we shouldn't hate on them because they took the time to mail us a video thats over a month old. /s<br />

ok... and? I dont... I dont see the problem, this is just the video they showed at blizzcon they had yet to release on youtube, and put it along side their message, it wasn't meant to be some &quot;OMFG LOOK AT THIS NEW THING&quot; no its just something to celebrate<br />

It just looks like an attempt to show potential investors that Blizzard has had a good year and spark some interest in their stock. It's a pony show for their games. They are saying &quot;look at our products&quot; they did great this year. <br />
<br />
This isn't for players of their games, the players know the state of Blizzard's games transcends a few cut-scenes.<br />

but you are never gonna hear &quot;sorry we are shutting down every single hospital in the world sorry&quot;<br />
<br />
yes being an esport player is a real job, but it does not have much job security, unless you are able to move from one game to another.<br />

HotS failed because it came to the market way too late. And to be honest it's nothing special. I mean it's on an ok game but eh having no items is boring.<br />
<br />
People were already embedded in LoL, Dota and Smite long before HotS.<br />

Other games are NOT the reason HotS failed. HotS failed on it's own accord.</div></div><hr />

WoD was filler, even while WoD was lackluster &quot;More developers are working on World of Warcraft than ever before.&quot; Which lead to Legion.<br />
<br />
BfA is filler, but with the best developers they have working on mobile. It doesn't stop there, Azerite failed system, class design the worst its ever been, removal of tier sets, gated, gates, nerf's leveling, reskinned races, lack of meaningful content, pushing numbers and cutting corners.<br />

<br />
I agree with removal of tier sets though. Is just so they don't have to design 13 new armor sets per tier. Irritates me a little because tier gear had some of the best sets. The Uldir set except maybe the cloth one looks garbage. The Alliance mail Warfront armor is so-so but that's about it.<br />
<br />
It feels like Azerite traits are trying to fill that hole and just don't imo. I mean the system for me got better once I levelled up but ofc they've turned the catchup off because &quot;it was only intended for seasons&quot;. Urgh.<br />
<br />
Also agree on Q and A. Ion seriously needs to start answering questions properly. I mean all he does is tell us shit we already know. FF14 live letters the devs tell us what we want to know and maybe throw in some stuff about FF14 products and whatnot but I'd say from the Q and As I've seen in interviews and at Fanfest those devs actually try to answer the more tougher questions.<br />
<br />
I mean Allied Races were never ever advertised as brand new. We knew they were already going to be reskins of existing races. However they should have just been story gated imo. Not rep gated. Give them a big storyline at 110/120 for their respective race to unlock them. <br />
<br />
What people find meaningful is subjective personally so I'll just leave that one where it is. Because I feel we might end up just going in circles if we discuss that one all day hehe. Also just a small point levelling got reverted back a lot for the 60-80 stuff at least. It's definitely a lot quicker again.<br />
<br />
But yeah. Some of your points I agree with absolutely. Some I disagree with though. Overall for me BFA has been decent. It's most certainly not without it's flaws but I just don't think it's worse/as bad as WoD imo.</div></div><hr />

I get that there's this whole hate-boner for Blizzard thing going on right now, but you're just deliberately being dishonest to reinforce your point. BfA is at LEAST as good as WoD, and probably a whole lot better. Just because you and a lot of others are bored of WoW's core systems after 14 years doesn't mean that islands, incursions M+ aren't 'meaningful content'. The 8.1 patch especially gave a variety of new reasons to go out and do this content, and if those aren't enough then I'm not sure what Blizzard can ever do to make it so in your opinion.<br />
<br />
I don't necessarily disagree with your points about Azerite, class design and the recent Q&amp;A's but come on man - the game's always had issues like that and to lump everything together and call the whole package shit is just flat out dishonest. <br />
<br />
Oh and also, they didn't put their best developers on mobile gaming. They said 'some of their best' during a shareholder meeting because guess what - you're not going to tell your investors that you've got Joe the janitor and some entry-level designers on what, in their eyes, is the biggest growing market these days. The day I see Jeff Kaplan and the likes working on Overwatch GO I'll join you in your hate crusade, but until then I'd take such statements with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eduwneso</div><div class="date">2018-12-24, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so it doesn't bother you their best developers were moved to mobile?<br />
that the diablo franchise is becoming rated PG, meaning the removal of blood, skulls, images of torture, satanic images, and that it's going to be loaded micro-transactions up the wazzoo?<br />
That the wow developers &quot;are happy with&quot; so many things we hate such as: class pruning, gcd changes, professions, crz, pathfinder, etc?<br />
that 10 days before Christmas, they go back on what they said and essentially fire 100s of people on the pro HOTS tour?<br />
have you no sympathy for Shaman players with the changes they have been promised since beta that never arrived?<br />
you don't care if Lore calls us all dickbags and other bliz employees dogpile on it with no consequence?<br />
have you not noticed the quality of BFA of is terrible and is being seriously compared to WoD?!?<br />
do you consider leaving serious problems in the game broken for months while next day emergency hotfixes are rushed out whenever &quot;fun detected&quot;?<br />
you have no issues blizzard deleting likes (both forums and youtube) of things they disagree with?<br />
<br />
Is it that unreasonable that people, after being shat on for so long, are finally getting fed up? Blizzard did this to themselves over a long period of time through the death of a thousand cuts.<br />
<br />
First, and I gotta start from here, a little missinformation from you, Lore called dickbags to people in a political discussion about the US, dunno about what was I don't care since I'm from EU, but because people are way to entitled to even search and spreaded this lie, others like you believe it.<br />
<br />
Second, &quot;their best developers&quot; yes they indeed say that, but they would say that for every new game-content they would do, marketing, for blizzard, all of the devs are the best, or so they want us to &quot;think&quot;, hence why they said so.<br />
<br />
Class pruning is real, and is sad, I won't deny that. That would have gone &quot;unoticed&quot; if they added more talents or skills for every expansion, a fail in BFA I agree.<br />
<br />
GCD it's not as bad as people say, very few skills are on it.<br />
<br />
Agree on the professions, except the ones that always are in a good place because of raiding/mythic+<br />
<br />
Pathfinder, althoug it has it's downsides, it's not bad nor good.<br />
<br />
&quot;that 10 days before Christmas, they go back on what they said and essentially fire 100s of people on the pro HOTS tour&quot; Did not know this, could you share a little info please? I can't browse for it, the firewall in my work blocs almost everything, it's a surprise that mmo-c it's not.<br />
<br />
About WOD, nope, it can't be compared, just seeing all we got (good or bad) and all we are going to have, 8.1 like it or not is way better than 6.1, and let's not talk about 8.1 vs 6.2.... and what will come in 8.3 vs there was not 6.3<br />
<br />
I don't know I like shaman, maybe because I don't play it hardcore I don't understand but it's being fun leveling with ele, will see about enh, and a friend of mine loves the healer.<br />
<br />
About bugs, can't say nothing here, you are right.<br />
<br />
Feeling sad or angry about the state of a game you love is understandable, now, being total dicks even for a video/email (yeah I know it's the video of blizzcon) and saying all those things I see people writting is just amazing. how far people will go for a videogame, I don't know what will happen with their real life if they all pent up all this anger for just this and behave like this.<br />
<br />

It's not a hate boner, it is a breaking point and Blizzard finally figured out how to piss off as many people as possible in one fell swoop.<br />
<br />
How many years have people complained about class design, or lack thereof?<br />
<br />
Player: Stop with the ability pruning!<br />
Blizzard: whats that you want us to remove more?<br />
Player: No! stop pruning abilities!!!<br />
Blizzard: We can remove more, because it makes the game more fun!<br />
<br />
Player: Stop with the gated content!<br />
Blizzard: What you like gated content?<br />
Player: No stop with the gated content!!!<br />
Blizzard: Boy do we have the expansion you've all been waiting for, and its all gated!<br />
<br />
Over and over again, warforging/titanforging more and more RNG<br />
<br />
Some of their best developers? That is all they have left and they are not working on WoW, they are working on Mobile Projects, the proof is in the pudding: BfA.<br />
<br />
Why would I suddenly be bored of WoW after 14 years? Is 14 some sort of magical point in time where you figure out how big of a waste this game is on your life? I figured that out in Vanilla..<br />
<br />
I've been burnt out several times throughout my WoW career.<br />
<br />
Vanilla: Burnout 2 times, came back and still enjoyed the game.<br />
Tbc: Burnout 1 time, came back still enjoyed the game.<br />
Wrath: Burnout 1 time, came back still enjoyed the game.<br />
Cata: burnout 2 times, came back still enjoyed the game.<br />
MoP: Skipped first half, came back kicking myself for not playing since release.<br />
WoD: burnout 1 time, came back still enjoyed the game.<br />
Legion: burnout at the end of the expansion (AtbT)<br />
<br />
Got into BfA beta, instantly hated playing the game (class design/quests/everything just meh), didn't bother with the release, let sub lapse.<br />
BfA: resub 2 months later. Played about an hour, logged out and let sub lapse.<br />
2 weeks ago I resub again with 8.1, played about 4 hours with a friend, logged and again letting sub lapse.<br />
<br />
The trend here stops at BfA, where coming back and enjoying the game isn't happening, clearly I'd love to enjoy the game otherwise I would come back.<br />

either they time gate content, or players feel &quot;required&quot; to rush through it instantly, and then after beatign the content in no time they cry about no new content.<br />

1 hour every week, or 5 hours every 5 weeks. one will have people getting an hour each week wishing for more, one will have people play 5 hours RIGHT AWAY then cry for 4 weeks about nothing new.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't get burnout per se. But I agree the gating in WoW is BS.<br />
<br />
FF14 doesn't do it. Actually the only one I remember was Alexander being gated for A WEEK after launch which makes sense since it gave people time to ding level 60 and get item level 170. Being able to do the content as I want to is way better than having an artificial gate behind it.<br />
<br />
LFR is the same thing. I mean if it was a 1 week gate between each wing fine. But after the first wing opens it's 2 weeks per wing.<br />
<br />
Say what you want but it's artificial time gating and it does irk me. I mean a one week gate to finalise and polish some stuff the fine. A 2 month gate on some LFR wings is just pathetic. Or over a month gate on story.<br />
<br />
Broken Shore is another pitiful example. 14 week story where only the last week was actual story. Other weeks were just typical &quot;go kill Legion&quot; garbage.</div></div><hr />

i mean do we have confirmation their best devs are working on mobile?<br />
also Lore called people on his personal twitter dickbags, people who were going to his PERSONAL twitter where he purposly does not answer blizzard related questions, and were shitting on him constantly, yeah, i would call them dickbags too.<br />
and i mean people like to say ion cant answer the hard questions, but refuse to remeber all the hard ones he has.<br />
<br />
game has always had bugs, literally always, remember when charecters randomly deleted, inventories emptied, charecters got stuck falling forever cause their boat from wetlands dropped them off under the world in stonetalon mountain?<br />
<br />
Some of the best devs are working on mobile, and the rest are split on other projects? Maybe Diablo 4 and a few stragglers left on WoW, but that is obvious because: BfA.<br />
<br />
People are dicks most of the time, calling it like you see it isn't great for any company and any respectable company would fire an employee who did this. There are many ways to deal with people that doesn't involve name calling.<br />
<br />
If you can't answer a question, don't talk for 3 minutes about shit that has nothing to do with the question.<br />
<br />
<br />
Time gating is a neccesary evil.<br />
either they time gate content, or players feel &quot;required&quot; to rush through it instantly, and then after beatign the content in no time they cry about no new content.<br />
<br />
1 hour every week, or 5 hours every 5 weeks. one will have people getting an hour each week wishing for more, one will have people play 5 hours RIGHT AWAY then cry for 4 weeks about nothing new.<br />
<br />
Time gating isn't necessary, it is lazy at the core of development.<br />
<br />
Gating is worse than allowing people to rush, because you waste peoples time, instead of rewarding it. Gates can inflate MAU's, but it can also give players time to find a new game, or play new content leaving in between major patches.<br />
<br />
Games need to remove the business side of the business in gaming. When the game is obviously restricting players for statistics, the game isn't as fun.</div></div><hr />

Eh not for that one thing.<br />
<br />
If he did it on a repeat basis and aimed more at the community then yeah a caution/final warning/firing would be on the table.<br />
<br />
Tseric did it continuously so that's why he was fired. And at the community. (Old CM).<br />
<br />
But yeah most of their good devs working on mobile kind of worries me a little. I have no desire to play a game on my damn phone. If I want to play a game then I want to play it on my PC or console.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter how good the mobile games are. Blizzards primary market especially at Blizzcon was PC/Console gamers. Did they really think announcing Immortal and only that would go down well for them?</div></div><hr />

Repeating a mistake doesn't make a company better.<br />
<br />
Unhappy customers are usually hostile, could you imagine if your local grocery store employee acting like this? Oh it's okay, all the employee's are unprofessional, Yo I am the community manager, and (these people) are dick bags, deal with it!.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has been falling behind and they have been getting into markets that already have titans in place, or are already over saturated.<br />
<br />
They went from jumping in early and refining genre and taking good ideas and making them better, to jumping in late and adding watered down flavors of the same coolaid.</div></div><hr />
