Maybe it's that 1 Night elf demon hunter from the starting exp and artifact questline.. Ravensong or something like that?<br />
Who cares.. she looks like any other Night elf female DH.</div></div><hr />

That's probably a random Demon Hunter. No one people should care about...<br />
<br />
You could try to speculate who it is if you read the Illidan novel, but if you didn't I don't want to spoil it for you.<br />

I concur. Guess it only makes sense if you have demonic fire burning in your brain. I suppose that's why we fought them in TBC; because we, as regular mortal heroes, thought that their agenda was crazy.</div></div><hr />

Just a compacted version of what went down in the book when they invaded Nathreza. A few cheesy lines and just DH posing to look cool. Quite shallow.</div></div><hr />

The demonhunters give all for their world to save it no matter the cost. This is something foreign to the burning legion, which exists only to destroy, convert and consume worlds.</div></div><hr />

it could be a random, but it'd be funner if she was someone of at least minimal significance.<br />
<br />
she could also be that one night elf i saw in a starting video thread... the one that loses herself(himself? can't remember correctly) to the metamorphosis. after all, the pitlord said she smelled more like a demon than a hunter.</div></div><hr />

nothing you said holds any actual water or weight. its 2016, not the 1940's. It's nothing to do with a progressive point score or some &quot;SJW statement&quot; you seem to be implying. Its people and individuals. This one happens to be a woman and you happen to be a insignificant smear in an age that has moved on past your and your kinds sort of thoughts ages ago. The only function of such notions is to slow us down and hold us back from a good future.</div></div><hr />

The difference is that the legion goes to all lengths to destroy and enslave all life, and demon hunters will give up everything (including their &quot;humanity&quot;) to stop them and bring about peace.<br />

The issue is that he didn't answer her question the way the game will. The important thing was missing: &quot;What sacrifice?&quot; The game will show, but that short video did not, why they need to go through such lengths and what they really did sacrifice rather than &quot;We could have been Mages or Shaman but screw it let's get pumped up on Fel and hope it was worth it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Btw why do demon hunters start at Mardum? Wasnt Illidan's plan to kill Kil'jaeden in Argus? Didnt he send them there when the alliance and horde was knocking on the Black Temple gate?

That's probably a random Demon Hunter. No one people should care about...<br />

<br />
what do you mean now? its been blatantly clear since BC in both the books (mainly War of the Ancients) and the game, this is the route they intended to go with Illidan. Hell, Metzen even said at blizzcon a few years ago when asked about Illidan that &quot;i always love a good redemption story&quot;.<br />
<br />
And i dont think hes really misunderstood, He has said he hates the legion with every fiber of his being multiple times, the only Azerothian hes truely hated and wanted to kill was Maiev. He's an asshole and hes admitted to that, hes arrogant and hes admitted to that too. The only thing he wasn't honest about was raising an army of Demon Hunters and that was simply because he couldn't risk the legion finding out. There really isn't anything misunderstood about him. If anything he's just an antihero...like Deadpool lol. People hate him but know hes the only hope they have against the legion. Even Ad'al said that the Naaru wont fight him because hes the Legions greatest threat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1. That big demon was a Pitlord not a doomguard.<br />
2. the answer, is clearly obvious and you know even more once you level a Demon Hunter. Demon Hunters use the power of their enemy against them and they are willing to do whatever it takes to protect Azeroth. To other regular people and us heroes, what they are doing is near the same level of what the demons do. They use demonic power and put it inthemselves and have to fight against it and contain that power. Many Illidari also have to sacrifice their own soul for the cause. In this case, if it means they have to fight with the demon within to deal a big blow too the Legion.<br />

yeah, it is the current year, current year people. it is 2016 not 3k BC. it is the current year muh progress. we kan secs now<br />
<br />
let me say it this way: from my point of view the Jedi are evil<br />
<br />
only because most if not all males slept for thousands of years. now it has changed, or rather returned back to old kingdom times<br />
<br />
<br />
only in a name. and only because Malfurion slept, but now that he is awake, he orders her around like a good, well taught pup.<br />
<br />
Dude what is up with so many of your posts being idiotic drivel where you bend facts and ingame material to match your twisted narrative?<br />
<br />
Tyrande still rules the night elves while Malf stands back and does druidic stuff and co-leads the druidic faction. The only thing he's actually done is hold back most of the druids from helping their own people in faction wars because &quot;neutrality hurr durrr&quot;.<br />
<br />
Female NE's are still the predominant alpha warriors, lawbringers and enforcers of night elf society PLUS they can become druids as of vanilla as well and have in droves. Lore wise, male night elf warriors are still few and far between compared to female warriors who comprise the majority of the army.</div></div><hr />

I mean, heck, even if you knew you could still see after you poke your eyes out that's not an easy thing to do. Don't act like it's no different from chugging a beer.<br />

You're right, but they turned what seemed to have originally been a one-off ominous line into a retarded meme-y catchphrase.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not prepared.&quot; was a great one-off ominous line in the railer, with a reprise at the end. It was &quot;You can't handle this&quot;. It was &quot;Come at me, fuckin' bros&quot;l</div></div><hr />

Yes, she rules them, but he rules her. Not to mention that he officialy is a co-leader. And let's be honest she is his housewife.<br />
<br />
And? I did not say anything about numbers. I have said that things returned back to old kingdom times. Males are becoming more and more active in military.</div></div><hr />

Maybe he was a Doom Lord in the Legion's campaign of destroying another world. Now he reaps his rewards and mainly sits in his citadel commanding lesser demons to the Legion's will.</div></div><hr />

even in his picture you can tell hes a pitlord, not a doomlord, meaning doomlord is a odvious rank, and also a race</div></div><hr />

Uh correction, you didn't learn the difference because you completely missed the point that Illidan saved the girls life.

I think Vandel was just a flavor character that we're never going to see in game. His purpose was to have an in depth look into what becoming/being a demon hunter is all about. The character served it's purpose and Vandel won't be seen again.</div></div><hr />

Yeaaah but my understanding is at the moment that's the best build, which is disheartening. It reminds me of my least favorite thing about old Monk, back when Chi Torpedo builds were silly good for AOE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And? I did not say anything about numbers. I have said that things returned back to old kingdom times. Males are becoming more and more active in military.<br />
<br />
There is no indication that he rules her or is a housewife, there is no &quot;lets be honest&quot;, since you reek of anything but honesty. Dont mock such cliche phrases with your vileness. If anything they are peers through and through. It is quite clear that while they are co-leaders, she is calling the shots for night elf society while he tends to natural disasters outside the concern of night elf policy and leadership, except to ask her military help when the druids cant handle that shit alone. While more males are joining the military, there is no indication that males are becoming significant in the military in anyway manner that will lead to a cultural shift or that they seek to cause this cultural shift in anyway that will surplant the women as the predominant warriors. Its more a case of necessity and a relaxing of the rules by the leadership now that everyone is together and there are constant issues to beat down. If anything they, as greenhorns, will be dependent on the millennia-old female veterans and superiors.<br />
<br />
Night elf society is far separated from other elven societies, both current and dead, there is no &quot;return back to the old kingdoms&quot; because that influence is completely wiped and long gone. Even the highborne remnants who lived from that age regret anything to do with it. What you're talking about is like thinking America will return to the state of medieval european society or the UK will turn into gauls in two decades. <br />
<br />
Night elf has been far departed from the old ways and has functioned that way for 10,000 years. do you understand how long that is? How culturally endemic things become after 20 years, let alone 1000 or 10,000? Especially for (ex)immortals who will stilll naturally live hundreds of years? <br />
<br />
No cultural influence is left from the old kingdoms, except as a warning of not to go overboard with your ego and not to be extremely reckless with magic, because of what is lost and still being lost.<br />
<br />
your points are so flimsy and far departed from the reality of the lore that they arent even addressed in any manner, not to the least. They exist purely within your narrow-minded imagination.</div></div><hr />

That didn't answer the question. Sorry. The question of what difference there really is between demons and demon hunters (who have demon characteristics) goes unanswered in the video.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
The difference is that the legion goes to all lengths to destroy and enslave all life, and demon hunters will give up everything (including their &quot;humanity&quot;) to stop them and bring about peace.<br />
<br />
What didnt you understand?<br />
<br />
When did Illidan mention anything about &quot;peace?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Like i said elsewhere, you have nothing of substance to say, not even to support yourself outside of repeating yourself with absolutely nothing to back your own words.<br />
<br />
infact nowhere in the other topics ive seen you post do you say anything that is supposed by the events of the game, the actual lore, nor do your words resemle anything concise or anything that can be considered a formative argument. You even steal the &quot;big words&quot; people use against you and employ incorrectly in other topics and discussions. <br />
<br />
You are simultaneously trying too hard and not trying at all. I feel embarrassed for you about these wet noodle replies you make in discussions, whether they involve me or not. At least certain that could be named who make questionable posts/topics bring some weight, effort and conviction to their points of view.</div></div><hr />

I'm quite sure that you are capable of being embarrassed for other people. it takes it to be progrssive. you know, I just don't really care that much, because you see I'm a cool person and when my dog or my cur barks I smply tell them things, I don't argue.

The girls question was one of power. It is the same power that demons and demons hunters use. The real question, and the one that Ilidan helps her come to, is that of purpose. <br />
Demons serve masters, they are tools to wrought destruction. Their lives have no meaning outside of what is told to them<br />

The girl's question was one of distinction. The answer given, essentially, was a difference without a distinction. Illidan's answer revealed that the Illidari are capable of and willing to do just as much evil as the Legion.</div></div><hr />
