Minor Updates<br />
I updated a few minor things on the site, links to the Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/) and Raidcomp (http://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/) have been added at the top of the left menu, icons are temporary and will be changed at some point. <br />
The Items category has been greatly expanded with links to the gear list pages.<br />
The Quests category has been added and will be expanded soon.<br />
<br />
Talent Calculator<br />
Most of the annoying bugs on the new talent + glyph calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/) should be fixed now, if you still experience any problem while using it please report it in comments. (Note: it will NOT work if you're using an outdated browser, sorry IE6 users)</div></div><hr />

Ensidia (w/e it is now) and their acolytes can whine how 10mans don't matter but that makes them neither right nor relevant. <br />
<br />
It also is encouraging that a 10man encounter can truly be a challenge and it breeds hope that blizzard will truly create an alternate raiding path instead of 10man = ezmore; 25man = hardmode. I know that's something that the &quot;hardcore&quot; have called for but it's something that I vehemently disagree with and from the looks of it there may be hope. Perhaps.<br />

really gz on kill, and i bet you got some shineys that was worth it.<br />
<br />
yet probably you guys not geting sponsership has nothing to do with any other guild. so instead of being happy about your kill you made your selves look like little jealous children on your anouncment. i lmao when i read it.<br />

i would like to quote their page to show :<br />

We have just killed Sartharion, 10 man version, with all 3 adds alive on the pull. Anyone familiar with both versions of the encounter will know by now the achievement is much harder to complete in the 10 man version. After a night of wiping, head-to-wall banging and learning to understand the encounter we went back today and succeeded. <br />
<br />
To my knowledge this is a first, and even though I do not wish to call it a world first to avoid flame, I do wish to challenge Ensidia to complete this achievement within a reasonable amount of time. After all, you claim to be the best guild in the world, so no encounter should be too hard for you guys. I know you can do it, I just wish you would. Show us the power of sponsorship. &quot;<br />
<br />
I just can't stop laughing sorry, you guys probably played several hours in a row, i don't want to throw a number in order not to underestimate (but i guess around 10-17 hours in a row, i mean no life right?) and yet you are being so childish and lifeless that all that motivated you was the jealousy that the other guild got a sponser and you guys don't have.<br />
<br />
i think this msg won't help you guys get a sponser. and your jealousy, method was never num 1, and tbh, with this post i hope you guys will never be, just pathetic no lifes jealous of not being good enough to get a sponser and geting a lucky try and managing to kill it, thats all your post told me.<br />
<br />
GZ, but what you posted just takes it all away and makes you guys worth nothing. (and all the so called trolls that replied above me, method members, you guys are just being pathetic it looks so bad, i'm not saying anything about nihilum/sk name is, i don't support them at all, and never did, they can be idiots themselves. but this time, method just lost all my respect to them as a serious guild. i understand your just a bunch of no life children and all you think of is the fact that you guys can't get a sponser. ofc you can't do you really think a sponser will want to do it for someone who says this kind of things?)<br />
<br />
lmao @ method and this kill. i hope someone else kills it and gives a better kill post then &quot;omg i'm a baby i didn't get sponsership and i'm jealous of the other guild for killing everything before me QQ&quot;. I was expecting for maybe a link of loot, who got what, to share the shiney's to brag the shineys, say the names of who came and managed, who helped etc. take some credit. instead you just.... rofl (think ppl get my point)</div></div><hr />

This is a prime example of how NOT to write; learn to use capital letters, try to make actually coherent sentences, and spreading abbreviations all over the place makes you look like a 10-year old. Oh, not to mention the actual content: nerd-rage. Good job, no one will take you seriously :)<br />
<br />
As for the actual news: I am glad that someone else than Ensidia/25th November/whatever they come up with next did this. Being able to beat all 25-man content but ignoring 10-man content doesn't make you the best. Being able to beat all the toughest content, 10 or 25 man, allows you to claim that title.</div></div><hr />

We did try it with 3 healers instead of 2, so our DPS fell behind rather quickly between the drake and the whelps, and before we knew it we had another drake in the mix making it all the more difficult. Having such a strict limitation on group setup to accomplish this with only 10 people easily makes this the most difficult achievement in the game right now... significantly harder than 25 man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, they just didn't mention they have defeated all 25-man PvE content. It's a point of view whether they were incorrect, misinformed or what. IMHO you have to clear all 10-mans and 25-mans in order to be able to claim to have cleared everything, but I guess their opinion differs.</div></div><hr />

Ensidia (w/e it is now) and their acolytes can whine how 10mans don't matter but that makes them neither right nor relevant. <br />
<br />
It also is encouraging that a 10man encounter can truly be a challenge and it breeds hope that blizzard will truly create an alternate raiding path instead of 10man = ezmore; 25man = hardmode. I know that's something that the &quot;hardcore&quot; have called for but it's something that I vehemently disagree with and from the looks of it there may be hope. Perhaps.<br />
<br />
Grats to Method.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the contrary, i think it totally ruins the &quot;alternate raiding path&quot;, they're just reversing the problem, instead of 10-man instances being a walkover, it is the 25-man instances that is a walkover (Of course all raid encounters sofar seem to be a &quot;walkover&quot;, but if Method is to be believed, then the 25-man content is more of a walkover than the 10-man content is, atleast in the case of the Sartharion encounter), and i agree.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard had to create a &quot;true&quot; alternate raiding path, then it shouldn't be nessecary to go to 25-mans to do 10-mans, and while that may not be the case, it's obvious that Method's 25-man gear does help with taking down a 10-man boss, and at the very least we know it's possible to do the 3 drakes on 25-man, without a &quot;lot&quot; of 25-man gear, whereas we can be pretty certain that if the 3 drakes are even possible with 10-man loot, then you'll have to get the best of the best loot before you try anything like that.<br />
<br />
So the 10-man content have a lot of polishing before it'll ever be an alternate raiding path, and 25-man content probably needs a boost in difficulty as well, but that might just be because of the generally &quot;weak&quot; content we've gotten sofar, but i think a place where they've actually done well on this is with encounters like Faerlina where you no longer need a priest to mind control, but unfortunately there are also encounters like gluth where you'll be using 1/3 of your raid doing tanking, and for example in the trash at Sartharion where you basically can't progress if you can't dispel curses.<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to eliminate those factors that requires a special group setup, and that's especially true for 10-man encounters, because you can't be certain that you'll have a team able to deal with every problem an instance gives you, unfortunately it may result in a lot of work rather than just downscaling the abilities and hp, but that's what's needed to provide a &quot;true&quot; alternate raiding path in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What you've cited as a &quot;special&quot; group setup I would consider standard fare. Decursers? Druid, Mage and Resto Shaman can do that. 1/3 as your raid as tanks? Please ... As you've cited, they've eliminated the need for absolute class specifics such as with mind controls and that's fine. However, remember back to Zul'jin phase 2 where a priest's mass dispel won out so much that most raids starting out would not go near Zul'jin without one even though you could work around it.That's completely acceptable. There should be a challenge in the raid that extends beyond the encounter. You should not be able to throw together just about anything you like and walk into difficult content and succeed. Mind you, they've lowered the bar considerably for group requirements; nonetheless, if you're advocating for your novelty groups, you will be and ought to be out of luck.<br />
<br />
Secondly, in regards to &quot;needing 25man gear to do 10man content&quot;, we are only within the 3rd raiding reset and the first one was cut in half due to a thursday release plus leveling time. While Method certainly has a good gear setup by now, they are in no way swimming in full T7 valor suits plus relevant pieces. No one is. If you look at armory for both Method and Ensidia, most of them are still wearing 10man pieces.<br />
Realistically, your average 10man raid will attempt and defeat this encounter when they're fully decked out in 10man gear. That's fine; that's its point in progression and it gives people a challenge to look forward to. <br />
<br />
Finally, the real challenges have not been set yet within the raiding game for wrath. This is just the beginner phase of raiding and we cannot proclaim what Blizzard has done right or wrong when they really haven't done anything yet. We may only take certain indicators such as the difficulty of Sartharian (3 drakes) as hopes that there will be indeed challenging and equally satisfying 10man content paralleling 25man content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah i know that it's not exactly impossible to get decursers, i just think that stands to contradict the very goal they had in mind with this expansion, eliminating the need for special setups, yes one class of 10 isn't exactly a &quot;special setup&quot;, but it's still at the point where you say &quot;We can't use you because we don't have any decursers&quot;, rather than as they themself said that they wanted people to take their friends/best skilled players regardless of their class.<br />
<br />
I just remember we had a situation with our first group down to obsidian sanctum, then realized they cast that curse on us (Where we actually didn't have any classes to decurse it at the time), but for example with Zul'Jin, if you had one dispeller than that was enough, priest or not, it just made the encounter more complicated, and i don't mind that, but if i don't take any dispellers with me (Yes it's unlikely, but it could happen) then the encounter becomes technically impossible, and that's a problem.<br />
<br />
I'm not in anyway suggesting they should take away those elements, nearly that they should probably refine them, for example that curse could be reworked to a 10 second duration instead, and not dispellable, it would force the person to stop hitting the target, rather than needing a special group composition, and in my opinion, still accomplish it's intended goal.<br />
<br />
But you're right, i'm not saying they're running around in the best gear yet, that's why i didn't try to treat as some kind of proof, as i said, i don't know if this feat is still accomplishable with no 25-man loot, but in my opinion atleast, the loot Ensidia had when defeating the 3 drakes on the 25-man also proves that the 25-man version is atleast accomplishable without the best gear in the game, and with that in mind, the same should be possible for the 10-man version, i.e. people in in not the best &quot;10-man&quot;-level loot should also be able to take the 3 drakes.<br />
<br />
This doesn't seem to be the case though.</div></div><hr />

Uh yea, it's exactly the same situation as in this fight. So why didn't you go protest that Blizzard change phase 2 Zul'jin? Oh that's right, you probably play (with) a magic dispel class all the time. (I'd guess a Paladin, they want everything.)<br />
<br />
I'm an ex-resto druid, and let me tell you, Blizzard is in NO WAY fair in terms of debuffs that need to be dispelled. It's freaking ridiculous how much magic dispel there is in this game, and all I can do is heal through it and do the best I can.<br />
<br />
There are very, VERY few fights that even HAVE a decurse in the game, and even less where it does much of anything.<br />
<br />
Dispel _____ skills exist, they should be used. Whether it's curse, magic, poison, or disease. Or are you saying we should allow 10 man groups without heal spells? Or a tank? (4 classes can heal, 4 classes can tank, 3 classes can decurse, not much different in my opinion.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because if you'd read my posts you'd see i'm not complaining, i'm merely pointing out that, in my opinion, standing by Blizzard own words they have not created what they set out to create with WotLK, i.e. seperating 10-man raiding from 25-man raiding, and removing the group composition requirements(barring odd compositions as no healers, tanks or all/almost all of the same class).<br />
<br />
So that is why i am not complaining about Zul'Aman, because firstly i'm not actually complaining, and secondly TBC isn't WotLK.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ohnoesBurrs</div><div class="date">2008-11-29, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard only addressed the group composition woes insofar as they pertained to severe class stacking i.e. resto shaman. The rework of the buff system only creates an even playing field for the 25man raiding teams as they can easily account for every buff/debuff. In other words, gear provided, all raiding teams start off on the same foot. You are never going to have that in a 10man; you are going to sacrifice certain buffs to gain others.<br />
<br />
The 10man raids are a different animal; blizzard never addressed any stacking woes in 10man raids because 1) they were never an important enough issue and 2) this is the first time that 10mans are being set on equal footing with the 25man content. We haven't seen what problems arise with the 10man setting because it hasn't been a self-contained ecosystem as it is today. Few people actually went into ZA with only gear from karazhan, they usually had Gruul/Mags and perhaps some SSC/TK pieces. Guilds that ran ZA usually came from 25man groups where group composition is flexible due to bigger player pool. When we go from Naxxramas to Uldaman, we will begin to see all sorts of interesting issues emerge.<br />
<br />
Bottom-line: 10mans are not 25mans. Both should be challenging; both should demand intelligent meta-planning. One should not be dumbed down in favor of the other.</div></div><hr />

It's been about a week since we did Sanctum but, uh, what curse? We didn't have a priest and as a resto shaman I don't recall dispelling anything at all. Rechecking WowWiki and WowHead, there's no mention of any curses at all.</div></div><hr />
