Tanks - Vengeance<br />
Imagine the tooltip for Vengeance read &quot;Your damage scales with the rest of your raid as if you wore dps gear instead of tanking gear.&quot; That's pretty much it.<br />
<br />
Q: Why not just make it +threat?<br />
A: Tanks tell us *constantly* that damage is fun and threat without damage is not fun. Devastate is a much more fun button than Sunder Armor.<br />
<br />
Q: Why make me have to worry about threat?<br />
A: Because it's part of your job. A fight where there is no real danger of losing threat means half those buttons on your bar don't do much.<br />
<br />
Q: Why not make tanks wear dps gear?<br />
A: A few reasons. The big one is that tanks care about survival so they want to gear for survival. The bear solution works okay, but I suspect if they had the choice, the druids would rather see us itemize bear leather (if we could solve all the skewed distribution problems that led us to the current goal in the first place).<br />
<br />
Now, it would be awesome if tanks did consider dps stats more seriously, and maybe outside of the instagib environment of Lich King, they will. Back in the day, tanks at least have say swords and rings for +threat fights even if they didn't use them all the time.<br />
<br />
Q: Why does Vengeance needs to fall off at all?<br />
A: Because we want you to care about actually hitting your buttons. You should be good at threat because you know when to use a Shield Slam for burst threat, not because of a nearly-passive aura that makes stuff stick to you like glue. If we wanted Vengeance to solve every problem of tanking, we would just make Defensive Stance et al. give you a 1000% threat modifier such that you'd never have problems.<br />
<br />
Q: But if Vengeance falls off, we'll wipe.<br />
A: That's not the intent. You have Shield Slam and similar abilities. You have a lot of threat generating tools. Heck, you have Taunt much of the time.<br />
<br />
Q: What is the role of Vengeance in PvP?<br />
A: Hopefully irrelevant. If making it dispellable isn't sufficient, we'll simply turn it off.<br />
<br />
Q: Why can't tanks do competitive damage in PvP?<br />
A: Because they chose the tank role instead of the dps role. Tanking comes with enormous advantages that are helpful in PvP, such as being hard to kill, hard to control and having good control of your own. That will be even more useful in the Rated BGs of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Q: [I don't like that design. I prefer a different design.]<br />
A: Feedback like that is useful to a point, but understand that your feedback will be more valuable if it does align with our goals. Saying &quot;I think tanks should do the same damage as dps specs,&quot; is fine feedback, but it's something we're unlikely to change. <br />

Focus<br />
We implemented focus because hunters do not feel like a magic class to us. They aren't casting spells. They are shooting things with a ranged weapon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435494098/focus-isnt-being-implemented-because-of-burst/))<br />

Protection<br />
Paladins were always the &quot;Block first, ask questions later&quot; tank class of TBC and Wrath. Yes warriors use shields too, but Holy Shield made us block far more than the other guy. <br />
We're just not happy with the way Prot paladins have been playing in Lich King. If you've followed these forums for some time that should come as no surprise. It's difficult to do that without breaking some eggs / butchering some sacred cows / insert your own metaphor here. Now we don't want to lose what it is that attracted you to the class in the first place, but we do need some space to come up with something we think is fun.

Holy Power as a mechanic is far from a polished entity. <br />
I would agree. It just went in a few weeks ago. But we have plenty of time before we ship. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26399010971/gc-please-stop-understating-15-block/))<br />
<br />
TLDR: 1) Please rethink the Holy Power = Mitigation philosophy and work it into Holy Power = Burst Threat philosophy.<br />
The problem with this is that survival tends to trump threat concerns for tanks much of the time, and that's a totally logical response to have given the encounters you're asked to tank. While there are some fights where burst threat matters, there are plenty that don't. Almost every fight involves the tank staying alive however. We didn't want to introduce this new mechanic which was supposed to add some interest to all three paladin trees, and then have Prot paladins fall back on just mashing buttons on cooldown the way they play today, at least on the fights where threat wasn't tight.

Don't worry, Ghostcrawler is here to talk about those sort of things, and there are plenty of other guys at Blizzard to read the bug report threads/ingame tickets and patch them to the devs, so there's no &quot;time lost&quot; at all here :)</div></div><hr />

All we do now is Chim Shot, Arc Shot, x Shot until we're out of instant shots, and we spam steady until one comes off cooldown... in Cata it's just a little different, you might SerpSting, Chim Shot, Steady, Arc, Steady, Steady, x... It's just taking away some of our massive burst damage and throwing SS/CobraS in as something we need to do between instant shots, not after we've blown them all...<br />
<br />
Imo, focus is a great thing for hunters, it just sucks at low levels and it still has a lot of tuning to be done.</div></div><hr />

Troll warlocks were not in the original race combinations, but it looks like they can be everything apart from paladins. I just checked on the beta servers too, so its not a mistake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are people on smack when they post such shite? I've seen tanks top the dmg done in bg's TONS of times and whenever I've watched live arena that had a prot warrior they did around about the same but sometimes MORE damage than the pure dps classes, I remember seeing Enforcer (old SK rogue) going on a prot war and he did the most damage out of EVERYONE in that 3v3, so when people say prot dmg sucks in PVP I ask myself, what the fuck are they smoking?<br />
<br />
There were a few tanks at the recent LAN event in Germany if someone can, go check the stats and see how they compared to proper dps classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well for one, I just hope they remember the difference between breaking a few eggs and dropping a 15-megaton payload on the coop.<br />
<br />
And I kinda have to agree with the last guy. I've said it before, I don't think anyone will take the opportunity to use Word of Glory to heal themselves and put up a shield over Shield of Righteousness to do damage and get 15% block given the opportunity to choose. I'm not saying it doesn't have it's uses, just saying that currently it's a bit lackluster when compared to others. <br />
<br />
With all of the absorption mechanics flying around today you might not know whether or not that Word of Glory would have absorbed the damage instead of another shield. I mean, you have the Holy Paladin Mastery, Sacred Shield, everything the priests do, and most of those will probably be a stronger shield than your Word of Glory shield. And as for being nearly dead and using it to save yourself, I don't think healers should be that mana starved that you need to heal yourself to survive unless it's the end of the fight and the guy's going down whether you live or die. And even if the guy isn't going down, it's probably a better idea to hit something like shield wall or our new gumpy last stand. And if you don't have those because you used them already to save yourself, you can't win this fight. Try again later.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't think Prot paladins will ever get too far from just mashing buttons on cooldown. There doesn't appear to be a talent that generates Holy Power only some of the time (At least for now), so it would be pretty simple to calculate how long it takes to get 3 and weave that into the rotation.</div></div><hr />

Yes, god forbid your class be balanced in PvP because you suddenly have to think about what you are using instead of spamming all of your abilities as quickly as possible. They will be just fine in PvE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In other words: If you agree with US we are going to do it.<br />
<br />
No: &quot;If your feedback fits with our overall design goals we'll do it.&quot; Which makes perfect sense. Why would they change design goals in midstream? The game would never get released if they just kept making wholesale changes based on every numb-nuts suggestion they get. So for instance:<br />
<br />
Good: I've been playing a hunter with the new Focus system, and I find that I'm casting Steady Shot much more often than seems reasonable. I think you should increase the amount of focus you get per SS or reduce the focus cost of other abilities.<br />
<br />
Bad: Focus sucks. Remove it from the game and go back to Mana. Change is bad and why do you always want to fix things that aren't broken?<br />
<br />
(Please note: I don't play a Hunter and I'm not in beta, I just chose low hanging fruit for my example. Please don't flame me about how Focus is/isn't awesome/terrible. I really don't know, it's just an example.) <br />
<br />
So in the first example the person is recommending a change, but doing so within the framework of the current design goals (Hunters moving to Focus). Now for various reasons of balance or tweaking, this person's suggestion might not be implemented; but it's much more likely to get serious consideration than the second person's suggestion for scrapping everything and starting over. Same with talents. A suggestion for how they might adjust a specific talent to work better is much more likely to be taken seriously than a suggestion to go back to 41 point talent trees.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always though that trolls on character screen look weird due to rather strange PoV angle. Its too low and at least females look like they don't stand vertical (in up front view). Currently for female trolls seems your PoV is set at their feet height. <br />
<br />
At least for troll Death Knights PoV is slightly better. Just look at character selection and alternate between DK and any other class (female). <br />
<br />
Except for gnomes even others races suffer from this PoV from &quot;lower body parts&quot; (between hips and knees, or even lower but higher than feet)</div></div><hr />

I also enjoy having to watch my cooldowns, if threat continues to decay, I can't stop and relax for a sec and hit my cooldowns, 'cause I'll have to beat the other tank(If it's a taunt oriented fight) and the DPS.

A: Because it's part of your job. A fight where there is no real danger of losing threat means half those buttons on your bar don't do much.<br />
<br />
Lets say you're leveling a tank through LFD since Level 15 and you hit 80. You have some badges so you some i232 gear, but your still not able to queue for heroics. Even when you gear up a little (through reputations and the AH) and are finally able to do heroics, you're being punished because your constantly losing threat to everyone else that has been doing heroics for months/years.

IMHO the buying more slots on a server is retarded and stupid. We already get 50 characters total. Why shouldn't we push to have those slots be all mitigated to one server if we wish. In other words allow us to have 50 of the current slots that are available anywhere we want. Enough of this buy extra slots bullcrap on a single server.<br />

When I got my war tank lvl 80, with just one piece of i245 ( bought non-set gear first ), and a mass ilvl 157, I still could keep the aggro just fine, except when certain classes/spec were doing 5/6k + ( I am talking about the war tank before recent changes, where it has become easier )<br />

<br />
<br />
Not overly complicated, but the feeling I get is that they want to make it more niche tanking. They are pushing paladins, and warriors to an extent, to be tanks for lots of small hits. While druids/dks will be able to tank bosses much easier. Though to be honest from what I have heard the druid and dk are getting the all around treatment. The dk system looks great, they don't have it perfect i.e. bp, but it looks good. Druid tanking looks like it's going to be great. The rage normalization from warriors won't be an issue considering the dps gear, lots of nice abilities gained etc. I think so far that had all been anticipated and most good tanks already have an 80 dk and an 80 druid or they are working on them. I got my 80dk awhile back, been working on my druid. <br />
<br />
They put up walls of text every day describing the ongoing development of the paladin and warrior. The reason why you ask? Resource issues. Either they make it so the classes have an overabundance of resources, or they make it so the classes don't have enough. They are trying to find some magical &quot;sweet spot&quot; that simply doesn't exist. If they make it so the classes have too many of a certain resource they are worried tanking becomes too fun, if they make them with too few tanking becomes impossible to hold threat. Why don't the other classes have the same issues? They have interesting ways around this, druids are fine wearing dps gear, with huge health pools. Dk, is similar, they use dps weapons, and they have some nice defensive cds to allow them survive. With dks though they have had an entire expansion to try and get it right. In the end what did they do? They gave them a spammable high threat ability, and buffed survivability while increasing some key abilities. They did the same for druids, and they will probably end up doing exactly the same for warriors and paladins. Give them a couple of high threat abilities that can be spammed, and providing them with some cds. It just apparently can't be a spammable high threat aoe ability. Blizz seems to be completely fine with spamming a high threat single target ability to maintain threat. Because pressing 1111111112111111311111112 is &quot;fun&quot;. <br />
<br />
They are reworking both classes imo, and everything so far should be considered to be in alpha and not even beta phase. It will probably be another month at least before we see anything near a working setup for either class. <br />
<br />
As it stands now though, they are pushing tanks into two viable classes and from there allowing several others to tank heroics but not raids.<br />
<br />
Also shamslam, just curious but could you post a link to your tanks armory. Wondering about race/class choice on it? I assume you have a tank since you were talking about how easy it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
NO, they have said their goal is to make all 4 tanks viable in most situations, bar a few fights where its natural that certain playstyles will be an advantage. Druids and DKs will not have an upper hand on boss fights.<br />
<br />
NO, it is not evident that most paladins and warriors have a spare druid and DK just sitting around to tank with should they become &quot;better&quot;. You have no way of substantiating this claim.<br />
<br />
NO, it is not impossible to find a sweet spot with tanking resources, it is not always one extreme or the other, as you suggest.<br />
<br />
NO, the fact that druids have dps gear and large health pools, and DKs have a spammable high threat ability does not mean they are exempt from the resource issue. If they have to find a sweet spot with paladin and warrior resources, they have to do the same with DKs and druids.<br />
<br />
NO, it is not evident that the current warrior and paladin models are far off from their finals versions. There is no evidence to suggest that they are at &quot;alpha&quot; levels of development.<br />
<br />
NO, it is not evident that Blizzard is trying to make two classes viable for raiding, and the others only tank heroics. That is ridiculous, and goes against their philosophy that they want all tanks to be viable for nearly all content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where in my post did I say anything about tanking being easy? I said the game as it is now is easy, which is true. The tanking changes are just one more thing (Healers actually running out of mana again, DPSers possibly having to take defensive talents to stay alive) in a big list of Blizzard making the game more like TBC again. It's somewhat obvious by Blizzard's posts that they agree with this too. Why else would they make it so tanks lose aggro over time? or that they are going to deliberatly make healers go OOM unless they are very smart, and that DPS will actually have to not tunnel vision and use CDs to not die.<br />
<br />
I said you don't need DBM or Omen in WotLK, which is also entirely true. I haven't used it since day one and haven't had any problems with raiding. Any tank around the same gear level as the DPS will have no problem with what they are doing if they are not retarded.<br />
<br />
You're probably just a tank that's butthurt that people think your job is just as simple as the DPSers or healers.</div></div><hr />

A: Because they chose the tank role instead of the dps role. Tanking comes with enormous advantages that are helpful in PvP, such as being hard to kill, hard to control and having good control of your own. That will be even more useful in the Rated BGs of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Uh, a bit about PvP. I'm surprised there's so few comments about this remark. The fact that this question was even seriously answered betrays a real lack of knowledge on the part of both the questioner and the blue. Why? Because the idea that 'tanks can't do competitive damage in PvP' is completely absurd. Anyone who's arena'd for a moderate amount of time the last few seasons will have come up against teams with prot warriors or prot pallies. Not only do they have a ridiculous amount of CC and survivability, but they regularly do as much or more damage than the pure dps specs (e.g. prot pallies out-damaging marksman hunters), which makes them a top choice class for serious PvPers. The idea that they 'don't do competitive damage' is just false. <br />
<br />
One can only conclude that this wasn't a serious question, and that the answer was equally unserious. Either that, or this problem won't be addressed at all in Cataclysm, because Blizzard actually believes that prot damage isn't competitive in PvP.</div></div><hr />
