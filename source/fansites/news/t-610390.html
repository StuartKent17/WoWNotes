Hunter - Pet Talent Trees<br />
I don't think we talked about the new talent trees for the hunter's pet, but here they are ! Thanks to Axolia for all the work she did on these articles. They'll be added to the Hunter class pages as soon as possible, for the moment please use the link below.<br />

<br />
Also, Wryxian made a small post about exotic pets on the official forums. <br />
The developers are currently working on the exotic pet talent. Exotic pets are exactly that, exotic and not the average run of the mill pet. But whether this name will stick or not, is uncertain at this point. But these will be a range of new pets with unique abilities, that only those with the talent will be able to tame and train. Where do you get them, well, we've not got news on that right now -- perhaps somewhere, exotic! ;-)<br />
<br />
These pets are different from normal pets, but they're not necessarily more &quot;uber&quot; than others. However they will have access to unique abilities not available to the normal pets that every Hunter can train. A Hunter with this talent will get extra power, but from the talent's associated additional pet talent points and not necessarily from the exotic pet. <br />

It's not like they couldn't do it, WoW is a success, why try harder. That's the biggest reason. If other studios can do it, with 30 employees, why couldn't Blizzard do it with 2.700 employees, and let's not forget that they sit on cash. It's not laziness but it's &quot;as long as it works&quot; attitude. <br />
My personal opinion, it doesn't bother me at all if there's the same models, although I will admit, if things would be unique, it would be even a better experience, and I'm not just talking about bosses, but item models and things alike.</div></div><hr />

Because adding things to the game that the community asked for 1-2 years ago isn't lazy? Blizzard have a lazy approach to this game. i.e There's no healing gems that you can purchase through arena points/honor, i'm sure this would take them a couple of years to implement right? And Paladins... i'm not even going to go there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually this is a GOOD thing, Defensive warrior abilitys are not exactly going to help a hunter in PvP because 90% of the time people ignore the pets.<br />
But in a PvE enviornment this enables pets to TANK, yes tank, with increased threat generation among other things, Hunters will actually beable to be a tank class is a Side sorta way. Blizz has been saying they have wanted to add more tank viability to the game so this is a good solotion.<br />
Not only will pets recieve more healing but they will have increased stats and resistances and threat generation if your in the proper pet family. No more striving to look for a tank for instances when that BM hunter has a Tank pet ready to go.</div></div><hr />

This is a good thing, waiting around for a tank in LFG sucked as the vast majority of Warriors are just fury.<br />

The more tanking/offtanking options, the better - makes Instances more accessible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok.2 options. option A) you are an arena NOOB. cause else,you would know how important killing hunter pet is at arena (specially 2v2 bracket). i will give you some tips-keywords,ask around. 'healers-drinking-need out of combat-pets follow,keeping them in combat-healers go oom-classes like warriors dont have pets aka cant prevent nhealer from drinking if they are cced-one healer drinks,the other doesn't-strategy is kill pet'. not only hunters got ew ability instantly revive pet, (with 10% hp which will obviously be spam healed asap),but now more survivability???<br />
there is also option B) you are talking about bgs. in that case....lol. try doing some search before further posting.<br />
<br />

/agree on more tanks available,the best for us, since im sick of random ppl wisperng my ms warrior &quot;hey.are you tank? if yes,care to tank for us heroic ...&quot; .but isn't it just WEIRD if a pet can tank to a heroic?? or even an 70 normal?? i mean..sure,make more classes that can tank, gogogo deathknights, but...whats next,not enough healers,locks minions get new &quot;holy&quot; tree? i mean, hunter can cc a lot as surv specc, he can do perhaps best dps in game as mm/bm and..well... his pet may be able to off tank a bit in some heroics if played properly... but wtf,main tank too?!?!?!</div></div><hr />

Lets get something straight, the pets aren't replacing anyone they are just getting useful abilities to the same level as warlock pets.<br />
They are designed to be off tank / CC / clothie savers not to Main Tank instances. Even if they do have t. he Health, Mitigation and Threat generation it is going to be extremely difficult to tank using a pet, the control mechanics don't work that well. <br />
