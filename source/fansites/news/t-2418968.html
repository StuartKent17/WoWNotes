<br />
That's what I've been saying all Beta!!!! This is clearly not targeting the audience of gamers who are older than, say, 22, which, let's be honest, is actually the majority of their playerbase. I don't think they get many new players, and probably not teens, with graphics from a decade ago.</div></div><hr />

He ain't gonna do sh*t, cucked every time. Useless character, should just die in the first BFA quest and be replaced by someone with spine.<br />
<br />
Cinematics were generally pathetic and except for the tiny Jaina badass moment, it was pure and rushed lazy writing.<br />

The only one capable is Tyrande but the problem is that she's constantly running after her lover because he seems to nearly die every single story line. <br />

<br />
My thoughts exactly she was GONE the entire xpac.<br />
Now she has the skills to raise ,fly and battle with daddys ghost ship, Level Undercity walls with cannons , clear a battlefield of plague , storm a city but not be able to clear 1 ROOM of plague, magic shell then port out?<br />
What ? <br />
was she OOM?<br />
<br />
Speaking of<br />
<br />
Where in the hell is Khadgar ? <br />
We can't get rid of him for alomst 2 xpacs then?<br />
He is just absent from what I figure to be a MASSIVE change in the balance of Azerth would keep his interest.<br />
Or is it Butterscotch Pudding and Matlock day at the old mages home?</div></div><hr />

Don't think she cleared the blight, she just froze it and if they kept it green you wouldn't be able to see the ice structures she applied either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As soon as I saw Anduin looking upwards with the same camera angle like in WC3, and also standing in the same spot as Arthas, I figured they might go for something like that.<br />
<br />
Even Genn/Allerria were behind him just like Falric and Marwin were.</div></div><hr />

your attention level is really low, she is not controlling the ship, she control magic water below the ship making the ship able to fly and maneuver, second she doesnt fire the cannons with magic, cannons are magical, those are conjured arcane cannons or you didnt notice they kinda appeared being purple from nowhere?</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Why the writte the Alliance leaders so stupid? walking like nothing, specting Sylvanas to surrender in the throne room. All this yers and they didnt know that Sylvanas will set a ambus/trap/treason/etc? Why did they let her get so close to Anduin? She could have killed/stabbed/cursed/poisoned/etc him</div></div><hr />

Lore-wise banshee screams instill terror in living minds. Their their whole thing, aside from possession.<br />

They probably should've shown Anduin and the company cowering though, it would've been more believable.</div></div><hr />

Nooooope. He's a priest through-and-through, but he's also traied to fight with a sword and in heavy armor. Heroes and NPC's transcends classes, just like how Thrall could wear a plate armor despite being a shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Na its like 0:0 She just destroyed own city and turned/is turning her allies against her while killing her own people. The Alliance if anything are getting closer together. If her aim is to make them loose hope and fall apart she is doing a fairly poor job. Everything she does seems to screw herself over that little more and make the alliance more determined.<br />
<br />
Same thing happens in real wars one side tries to destroy the other sides hope. (look back to the bombings in the UK during the second world war) you would see pictures of the British just getting on with it often sitting in a destroyed workplace in suits sitting a good old cuppa like nothing happened. It really annoyed the attackers and brought the people closer together.</div></div><hr />

It's also useless to the Horde, not only because of the Blight but also because it's been utterly destroyed.</div></div><hr />

That is how I, as Horde, see it to. The only thing that is starting to be annoying is that we can't seem to actually kill any Alliance leader(s) ... Jaina ex Machina indeed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont know what was worse, Jaina appearing with her magical ship, Alliance leaders being stupid enough to enter, Sylvanas going &quot;REEE&quot; mode then flying away (how is that even possible? Yes banshees can fly but in their ghostly form, not with their physical body they possess) or Jaina teleporting everyone to safety.<br />
<br />
You get to ask blizzard where was this Jaina with her imba magical ship before, where were her mass teleporting powers, where was this flying Sylvanas during her encounter with Genn or Malfurion...<br />

first off she was controlling the frost magic used to elevate the ship, second the 'cannons' she fired were entirely made of arcane energy there was no physical cannons on that ship so to answer your question that's how she did it, and it's well within her power to do so if you recall it was only through personal intervention that stayed her hand from obliterating orgrimmar after the events of theramore with a tsunami wave and thousands of water elementals at her command.</div></div><hr />

Right ... she's obviously just going after her own agendas. I don't think you people understand what it means to be a leader. Sylvanas is not some XYZ character, she is a player faction leader. She should defend her own city not destroy it and laugh about it. Even Hitler commited suicide once Berlin fell.</div></div><hr />

Traps laid out in this battle yea I agree, but traps just like the night elves laid out as she moved to teldrassil.<br />
<br />
Her initial objective has failed totally leading to this. As per the books. She wanted to &quot;strike a blow that bleede the alliance dry&quot; by capturing teldrassil.<br />

Instead she sets fire to it because some random elf named just a couple months ago makes her angry. And thus is setup to start a war that is impossible to win not just due to lore but also due gameplay reasons.</div></div><hr />

Just what? Her Agenda was to separate the factions by continents while also causing as much damage to the alliance as possible. Ether what i never fucking said she was a good leader. Just the Alliance near enough played directly into her plan which was to kill as many of them as possible not defend the city. It was a trap to bleed the Alliance. With the exception of jaines interventions she completed basically everything went as she intended. Hence a minor victory.</div></div><hr />

Not saying her over arching goal went according to plan. Simply the SOL did, and that at best it can be considered a minor win for the Alliance. Also saying its impossible win how exactly?

Jaina is one of the worst main character ever. She always does something stupid that just doesn't work, she is the type that always does something wrong, like why was she not there in the beginning of the battle? She instead went to search for an old ship to just arrive and shoot some arcane balls when the battle was basically over. She didn't even use the ship to shoot Sylvanas down from the horde zeppelin, instead they watch from their own ship how the horde gets away with everything.<br />
No wonder Kul'tirans hate her, she is just really stupid.</div></div><hr />

Banshees are incorporeal undead elf women, known for their unholy screams and the unsettling ability to possess the bodies of their enemies.<br />
<br />

Its better writing than what you could come up with. What narrative would there had been if they just went in and attacked instantly? How would that evoke emotion with the viewer.

Easy there bud. Wasnt saying anything abut Jaina as a character, the writing or anything like that.

You did not watch the story trailers I presume. She has ample reasons for everything. She's a well rounded char with a lot of emotions and backstory. Read it up sometime, maybe open up a little and then you'll understand.<br />

They literally portrayed the two leaders as complete retards and there was no logic there whatsoever.

She was a banshee who went back and re-entered her corporeal body. So...not sure exactly what that makes her, but it's more than just a simple incorporeal banshee.

Same thing happens in real wars one side tries to destroy the other sides hope.

I agree with them...very entertaining so far...these literary critics are laughable<br />
Is it really that hard to get what an opinion is? People like and dislike things. Those are opinions. Blizzard's writing was never objectively good. It was ok. Now it's going into bad, illogical, predictable and therefor disappoiting. <br />

Also, if you really like something, how are you bothered with people disliking it?<br />
<br />
Also I did not say it's wrong he likes it. But them not expecting the events doesn't make the story unexpected as plenty people expected exactly that but rejected that as being far too expectable even for Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Blizzard storytelling is flashy moments not really connected into a coherent world. I still as a Horde druid have much more reason to go with Saurfang than with Sylvanas' Horde.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard wants a morally grey world they should read Overlord and learn how a proper epic story with complex characters is done in a fantasy setting.</div></div><hr />

Seeing Sylvanas playing it all cool when facing off against a bunch of alliance leaders, and just having pure 'I don't give a F' attitude was awesome. I loved the banshee moment, but not as much as the BFA reveal trailer.<br />
<br />
And on the flip side i liked how it showed how young Anduin is, and he is still learning (from mistakes it seems). But he's getting there.<br />
Seeing Jaina return was great, as i would love to see her show her true power and go crazy. People commenting on her shooting the canons etc, could easily be other mages inside the ship doing that.<br />
<br />
All i read on nearly every post is people complaining about the story or the direction it's going. Personally i love it, and Blizzard are very clever in their story telling. Clever enough to get people so angry about all of this, just to do a plot twist somewhere down the line that surprises everyone and makes them all do a 180.<br />

She's shattering her Horde into factions. She gave up one of her stronger persons because he &quot;wanted&quot; an honorable death? She which is it -- she respects honor or doesn't she? And the fact that she used blight which inherently goes against what orcs and tauren are comfortable with.<br />

On the face she's winning but on the books, she's absolutely losing. She also lost her main city. Let me rephrase this: The person who started the war lost their own capital.<br />

<br />
Also I did not say it's wrong he likes it. But them not expecting the events doesn't make the story unexpected as plenty people expected exactly that but rejected that as being far too expectable even for Blizzard.<br />
<br />
I'm sure &quot;plenty of people&quot; expected it. There are also &quot;plenty of people&quot; who didn't. In the same way there were plenty of people who logged in when patch 8.0 hit and wondered why their itemlevel was reduced, spells were removed, etc. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard storytelling is flashy moments not really connected into a coherent world. I still as a Horde druid have much more reason to go with Saurfang than with Sylvanas' Horde.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is an opinion or something as another &quot;fact&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
If Blizzard wants a morally grey world they should read Overlord and learn how a proper epic story with complex characters is done in a fantasy setting.<br />
<br />
You should work for Blizzard since you have such a good sense of the game, the storytelling of the game and also in general. You appear to be way above everyone else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a TLDR: No one of you can say that a character is poorly written, or the story is bad. You can say that you think it is - but that doesn't make it so. It also doesn't mean it's the opposite - good. It comes down to personal opinion and there is absolutely no way for anyone to say if it's &quot;objectively&quot; good or bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the face she's winning but on the books, she's absolutely losing. She also lost her main city. Let me rephrase this: The person who started the war lost their own capital.<br />

So far her only win is the world tree and a small town.<br />
<br />
Her capital is orgimmar not UC. <br />
<br />
The Horde is yet to splinter <br />

I really dont see how she was meant to stop him. He stop following order and their in the middle of a battle<br />

<br />
(also yes clearly Slyvannas is being set up to be a raid boss)<br />
<br />
Gameplay wise you already know. Lore generally follows right along or right before. Even besides that generally they work to provide a middle ground in their story telling rather than actual execution of statement. E.g<br />
<br />
Varian saying &quot;we will end you&quot; at the end of SoO.<br />
Now as players we know that is an empty threat because there will never come a day where an orc player wants to log on and the message &quot;sorry faction wiped out by alliance. You can play human instead&quot;. <br />
And from a lore perspective the horde still maintained control of the areas it took over and there was no military effect on horde capitals.<br />
At most that statement showed was &quot;right now we are stronger than you are&quot; but that all disappears within one expac too (and honestly not much time was wasted between MoP, WoD and Legion).<br />
<br />
Unless they do (there is a slight possibility) of a total sever wide faction victory, then servers clash by sharding or phasing. But that would take a ton of work. And looking at class balance and raid dates on beta chances of that tech being used this way look slim</div></div><hr />

what are you talking about? thats not lore reasons those are game play reasons. the only lore argument you made is at the end of MOP Alliance is stronger then Horde. Which is true but at the same token Horde Allied races so far are MUCH more useful then the Alliances. Again not a reason why its impossible to win.</div></div><hr />

That lore reason I provided is all that is needed. Blizzard for the sake of business and gameplay will never give one faction total victory over the other. It will always be 50 50 or some debate on who lost more. All of this would just result in characters being lost. The issue this time is, that now we have a fun character on the line. <br />

Every other leader besides sylvanas is pretty much linear. But as you said, being set up to be a raid boss pretty much (or God forbid, a Sarah Kerrigan)</div></div><hr />

But remember, technically, she is not an undead, Banshee got together with the undead but they are a spacial kind of it, I don+t think it is correct to categorize them as undead, they are a special kind, just like Sylvanas, they were not fully killed but taken out of their body, left with a lesser degree of consciousness but unable to act by their own will (initially), as they were slaves of someone as Sylvanas was a slave of the Lich King in soul and will.<br />

Jaina singlehandedly took on the entire Horde Army and sent them into retreat.<br />

The only reason Jaina didn't level all of Lordearon is because the Alliance wanted to take it and turn it back into an Alliance Stronghold.<br />
