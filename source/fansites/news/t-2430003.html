Reddit AMA Feedback<br />
Hi. Just for some additional context in advance of this AMA: I suggested and volunteered to do this, and I'm looking forward to it. I know there are a ton of questions and concerns that feel unanswered right now, and a need for much more robust communication on our end. I am accountable for everything that goes into WoW, so that should begin with me. A standard streamed Q&amp;A wouldn't really be sufficient to cover the range of topics that are likely to come up, since we're limited in the number of questions we can fit in. And a forum post or blog would end up as a giant wall of text that doesn't feel much like a conversation. So r/wow felt like the perfect place to address a wide range of topics in an open forum.<br />
<br />
I'm planning on spending at least a couple of hours responding, and I'll try to cover as much as I can. It'll just be me tanking this, so apologies in advance if I can't field a question about the nuances of Swift Roundhouse interactions for Windwalkers, or whatever.<br />
<br />
Also, to be clear, we don't view a one-off AMA as a silver bullet. It's impossible for everyone to agree with every decision we make, but you shouldn't feel unaware of them or disconnected from why we chose a given course to follow, and that will take a sustained effort on our part. (Source (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9fk8a2/ama_announcement_developer_ama_with_ion/e5xdif1/))<br />
<br />
Then perhaps it's time to upgrade your own? It boggles my mind to see a blue say something like this. Basically your saying, &quot;Ya, their platform for communicating is better than ours so we hang out there&quot;.<br />
<br />
That thought crossed my mind. I thought they were going to be upgrading these forums, I'm not sure what the status of that project is. The funny thing is that Twitter and Reddit are far more toxic than these forums ever were, I'm a little confused about the stated reasons.<br />
This is very much still in the works. Even though new forums are coming soon™ these new ones still wouldn't be able to accommodate this specific style. There are merits to both styles of forums, for WoW specifically I think this style is better. Considering we at most do an AMA there once a year or expansion almost, I don't think adopting that style is worth it for that convenience once a year. We can still just choose to format the questions and answers and repost here for you guys since its understandable that some folks don't like Reddit or Twitter. I'd rather accommodate than force people to use a platform they don't like honestly and bring that content to them.</div></div><hr />

Haha... Is that what kids are calling it these days...&quot;overtuned&quot;. How about just plain difficult and not meant to be killed on the first try. Back in the day it took 154 days to kill Ragnaros,vanilla Kel'Thuzad 90 days,Kil'jaeden in Sunwell 62 days,Yogg-Saron 85 days,Lich King 46 days...from then on kids started crying &quot;overtuned&quot; and it took 1-2 weeks to clear endgame. Now everybody wants first kill on day one. Pathetic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or people are just far far far better. Those bosses you mention would have been a minor speed bump to guilds like method or limit. I'm pretty sure that the mass of ordinary but good guilds will be stuck on them for months. <br />
<br />
You have a problem in raiding atm - do you target difficulty at the top .001% of players? or the mass of folk who'll encounter it a bit later....</div></div><hr />

When an add alone needs you to do 50k Dps at the start of an expansion when people are avg in the mid teens, yeh I think it warranted some adjustments.</div></div><hr />

Um...those numbers I mentioned were for world first kills. And in cases like with Fetid,it's only a matter of gear till they kill it without a nerf.</div></div><hr />

Is it not end game? For me the entire Mythic difficulty is end game,not just the last boss of the tier.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Back in the day it took 154 days to kill Ragnaros,vanilla Kel'Thuzad 90 days,Kil'jaeden in Sunwell 62 days,Yogg-Saron 85 days,Lich King 46 days&quot; these bosses are last boss of instances. Like G'huun.<br />
<br />
Fetid is just a filler boss (farm boss). He is meant to be down first/second day like other filler/farm bosses in the past.<br />
Blizzard already fixed him and its confirmed he was overtuned.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Um...those numbers I mentioned were for world first kills. And in cases like with Fetid,it's only a matter of gear till they kill it without a nerf.<br />
<br />
Limit and other top guild were geared for Fetid but still couldn't get past 80%. They even farmed Myhtic10+ for Fetid. Also, how can you get gear from Zul, Mythrax, Ghuun if you cant even get past a FILLER boss?</div></div><hr />

Way to try and spin it. It's popular to hate on WoW and always has been, and no matter what the dev team does they get shit from it. From one group or another. And even if it is just your view on the wow dev team, it's still unhealthy. If you dislike something, leave it. Groveling in the hate and dislike is seriously unhealthy and it wont change a damn thing because it just makes you come of as unreasonable.<br />
<br />
I'm not attacking anyone here, I'm just stating that I'm not suprised that Ion doesnt take feedback seriously when he gets shit for everything, regardless of what they do.</div></div><hr />

I'm actually having fun playing the game (check armory if you don't believe) but when i see how they don't care about content Quality and rush a product for whatever reason they have i get disappointed. Don't judge me by one comment i made on MMOC , i've given plenty of feedback whether in in-game suggestions or beta forums. At this point i'm just disappointed in them because people have aleady pointed out everything that was wrong with bfa months ago.</div></div><hr />
