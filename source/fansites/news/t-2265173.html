Protection Paladin Tier 21 Set Bonus<br />
By any chance are we getting a change to our active mitigation in 7.3 to address the downtime and gaps in our shield of the righteous compared to other tanks active mitigation?<br />
<br />
The current plan for the new set bonus, numbers are not final:<br />
<br />
2p - Block chance increased by 10% (additive).<br />
4p - when you are not affected by Shield of the Righteous, the effect of the 2p is increased by 100%.<br />
<br />
I don't have any information to share regarding active mitigation plans for any of the tank specs. I'm just commenting about the set bonuses.<br />
<br />
The goal of a set bonus is not to &quot;fix&quot; all of the potential weaknesses of a spec. <br />
<br />
If you have concerns with the base toolkit of a class, that's totally fine, but is not something I am going to resolve or comment on in a thread specifically about set bonuses. You are better off starting, or adding onto, a thread in the Class Development forum.

Raid Testing Schedule - July 28-31<br />
Just as a reminder for everyone, as was the case with Nighthold and Tomb of Sargeras, we plan to continue raid testing for Antorus on the PTR in the weeks and months leading up to its release (even after 7.3 is released). We recognize that progressing through Tomb of Sargeras will be a higher priority for many of you, so these first few rounds of testing are primarily for shaking out any major game-breaking bugs we can find, and less focused around mechanical tuning or overall difficulty.<br />
<br />
Feedback on difficulty or mechanics is certainly still helpful, but don't worry if you’d rather focus on Tomb of Sargeras for the time being. Any fights we test in the next few weeks will be tested again later on. Thanks!<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
There was a recent situation where world mobs were changed to scale with the players’ ilvl, instantly causing a HUGE backlash as it was intentionally left out of patch notes, because “they wanted players to experience the change organically”. The timing here was very unfortunate as, not that long before, Lore had gone out of his way to explain how they NEVER intentionally hide changes since it would eventually be found anyway. What are your thoughts on this kind of player info throttling?<br />
I am going to answer in a more general sense. You’d have to ask Lore about this specific situation.<br />
<br />
In general, when I say that it is pointless to try and hide information from players, I’m referring to the concept of “stealth nerfs.” The (somewhat specious) argument goes that when we developers want to nerf something, but don’t want to deal with player backlash, we might choose to be all sneaky and just try to hide the nerf. But in reality, it’s pretty easy to poke holes in that kind of strategy. First off, players more than likely are going to discover the change anyway through data-mining or experimentation, so you’re not really hiding anything. At best, you may just be delaying any backlash that might occur, and it might be worse because now players feel deceived as well.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, this doesn’t mean every single thing needs to be documented in patch notes. For starters, on LoL (and it was true on WoW as well and I assume still is today), we generally make far more changes and bug fixes than we document, typically because they are trivial, and we want the patch notes to be somewhat focused. Also, sometimes you do want players to be surprised. If we put some kind of Easter egg in the game, we wouldn’t document it. We would want players to discover it on their own.<br />
<br />
It’s also true that sometimes we just forget to document a change. It’s really challenging to stay on top of each and every data or code change that gets implemented patch to patch. We have systems to try and capture all of these for patch notes, but they are managed by humans, and humans make errors.<br />
<br />
Once in awhile we will make a change and choose not document it because we don’t want to bias perception. For example, sometimes we’ll make a matchmaking improvement that will speed up queue times, but we want to see if players notice (i.e. was the fix worth it?) before listing it out. This kind of thing is really important for player behavior, where perception can be everything. You just have to be really careful with this line of thinking. You could easily corrupt it into nerfing a champion just to see if players notice. I would not advocate that. <br />
<br />
If you’re a developer writing patch notes, my advice would be to put yourself in players’ shoes. Is it more fun for the player to know about the change or not to know about it? (Source (https://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/161250345398/there-was-a-recent-situation-where-world-mobs))<br />

<br />
Yup. Always save your tickets. Every year or so they'll add something new and you'll wish you had. I think the last big sink was the classic dungeon set replicas, and those were like 300-500 for a whole set.</div></div><hr />

Might I suggest seeing a mental health professional? The fact that you have 4,500 posts in which you attack a company as though its employees burned down your house, kicked your dog, slept with your wife, and spat in your eye is getting very tiresome.

Does it mean the dancing bear will be gone? (at least from the vendor)<br />
<br />
Spell ID is different when learned of course.<br />

Will get dancing bear next faire for sure then, if it's &quot;stealth&quot; removed in 7.3 it's the last chance probably.</div></div><hr />

Except that Lore isnt a dev and even the people who are responsible to communicate with the community dont do it. Sigma is a miserable bastard and everytime he shows up to post 3 lines and thinks that he knows how Elemental works the whole community pukes. Sigma is atleast as bad as Celestalon when it comes to communicating with the player base.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lore and them post FOR the devs because dev time is better spent developing, not arguing semantics with mouth breathers on the forums and they have posted plenty over the time period, much more than GC talks about wow.<br />
<br />
And three lines my ass http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1067136-frost-death-knight-in-73/, they talk more then devs in any other game I've played, ever, most games you might get a quip around patch time, but that's it.<br />
<br />
And just because YOU don't like something they say doesn't mean they're not saying it, do I agree with every design choice? No, but there's a reason for everything.</div></div><hr />

Because that's the angle all mounts look more or less the same from, effectively reducing them to what they are.. showboats. Because players made them so.. Pinto all the way.</div></div><hr />
