Heroic Leap Reliability<br />
Completely changing Heroic Leap so it works like shadowstep or (feral step) it would make it much more reliable and useful in PvP, and it could be used to jump up platforms and get back on targets like shadowstep does.<br />
<br />
This would actually be a step backwards in my eyes, the ability to choose the location you will land on Heroic Leap is a great offensive and defensive tool. I cannot count the number of times that Heroic Leap has saved my warrior from death by it being defensively, and on the other side, you can use it offensively gain ground on fleeing opponents or any of its many other applications.<br />
<br />
I feel that adding a targeting requirement would lower the manoeuvrability of the class and remove the unique feel given by this ability.

I mean, after EVERY FUCKING XPAC since I play WoW (BC+) IF there was a discussion about a new race/pet/world it was pandarian everytime. And now - nobody wants it ... Oh, how the ppl were going about the best race ever from WCIII etc. pp. Well - ontopic again - I like the scenery - there will be some &quot;asian&quot; influation, but why not? I don't think every landscape looks as asian-themed as Wandering Isle and there will be some more stuff. But at least not the current 5 complete different zones - in cata I had more of a &quot;patchwork&quot; feeling to the zones then the others before. I mean, the troll zone in Wotlk was way different from the others, but it still was northend everywhere. In cata they are not a bit together ... nothing really familar :/ With MoP - even if some don't like the asian theme - I think they can do something new, they can make wow fun again ... right now it tends to be boring. Oh - and I would enable full pvp for all zones in the first 5 months even on pve servers - war everywhere!</div></div><hr />

because rogues aren't warriors. :P<br />

<br />
is it just me or does no one else notice that the waterfall from 0.23 on that youtube looks like it was just remodeled from nagrand &gt;.&gt; <br />
<br />
And now people have taken to complaining about the waterfalls? &quot;remodeling&quot; something like a waterfall... not as easy as it sounds. Anyway, THESE (http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_G65uMbgx0rY/TCo_DwuDvtI/AAAAAAAAAQk/q7vlPHKNprY/s1600/nagrand.jpg) are Nagrand waterfalls... compare them yourself, and you'll see they don't look too much alike.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing left? No it's just a slow news day. It kinda always slows down on the news front at the end of the expansion. Give it a few weeks, starting next month, I should think there will be a lot more news. If I had to take a guess.</div></div><hr />

That isn't the point of liking it or not. The point is that they aren't getting anymore or much more subscribers out of the EU and US market so they are trying to break into the Chinese market and they did that by making a x-pac that would appeal to the Chinese doesn't mean people in EU and US won't like it.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to be able to use that as a defensive move aswell and shadowstep to an ally/healer instead of an enemy or making it like heroic leap would be awesome aswell and lets face it, if warriors can do it why not rogues?<br />
<br />
Yeah, and maybe they could finally fix the f***ing Blink issue which is there for years???</div></div><hr />

So WotLK tried to corner the Skandinavian market and Vashj'ir was made to appeal to Atlanteans? Honestly, I'd rather think that the people whose mythology gets butchered would shun the expansion.<br />
<br />
Seriously, WoW should just have gotten the obligatory Asian-themed expansion out of the way like the old Guild Wars did.</div></div><hr />

I like how they are going for that sprawling Asian feel and beautiful scenery like you see in movies like &quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot; &quot;Immortal&quot; &quot;Fearless&quot; &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot;. Man this is probably gonna be the only expac were I will actually do all the quests in each zone :) at least the first run through.</div></div><hr />

But I'm also not sure that Blizzard's approach of trickling out MoP details slowly over the course of the next year will be enough to retain the player base. I find the player statistics postings by MMO Champion more interesting than the next expansion details, which is a bad sign... :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was also thinking, &quot;refreshing&quot;. After the doom and gloom and darkness of the last couple Xpacs, I find myself more and more accepting of what I suspect to be a change of pace with the atmosphere of MoP.<br />
<br />
I still don't really see myself getting into the &quot;Pokemon&quot; style pet battles, but I imagine there will be a big following once players start to experience it. I have always enjoyed playing the Brewmaster in WCIII, so I have no problems with the new race and can easily disassociate it from the recent movies.<br />
<br />
In general I think I'm looking more forward to MoP more and more. I was never against it, just not super excited about it as I normally am with the new Xpacs, but as time has gone by and the more I see about it, the more I'm ready to jump in.</div></div><hr />

They don't work for Blizzard, no one cares what a green says, half the time they don't know what they are talking about like every other schmuck in WoW and it's annoying scrolling through a ton of useless green posts to find out what Blizzard said. case in point: http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215747-i-am-disappointed-in-blizzard-harassment/</div></div><hr />

<br />
There might be a slight possibility that among the 12 mill different accounts, there has existed people with conflicting opinions on stuff. Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

No WOTLK fit into the lore this doesn't they warped the world to fit it and there was never a Scandinavian themed race</div></div><hr />

The panda even has some identical move from the movie, and he's fighting against a monkey? <br />
How long until the furious 5 be implanted into MotP?<br />
<br />
Anyway, can't wait to see the x-pac tho! ;)</div></div><hr />
