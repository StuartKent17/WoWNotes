Good on Saurfang for shaming Thrall into action. Good on Thrall (can't believe I'm saying that) for declining to lead the horde (much better with a real Orc or at least someone strong in charge.) - and hey maybe if he'll fight for the horde he'll die for the horde and redeem himself.</div></div><hr />

Looks like it since it seems that Thrall is about the only one that has the respect from both sides.. And she feels threatened by it for if he returns she loses control of the Horde..</div></div><hr />

But to summarize this video - Sylvanas sent her assassins after Thrall. Now, as much as I don't like Sylvanas and would love to see her go, it was actually a valid strategic decision to go after Thrall. After all, he most likely still has a lot of sympathizers within the Horde and should he choose to come back, he'd be a legit threat to Sylvanas' rule.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, but another take would be if she had not sent them then Thrall would of still been there living a peaceful life with his family.. Now by attacking him that way has really only stirred the hornets nest so to speak..</div></div><hr />

I think they were only sent there as scouts/only to act if thrall is about to do something. Which is why they only acted when Saurfang showed up... but who even knows with blizz writing nowdays...</div></div><hr />

It's one of the flaws of WoW's design. There really isn't a solution to it but even though a WoW 2 will never happen or even a Warcraft 4 I have a feeling if the lore team could there would be a massive Horde break up. They just can't because the game is designed around 2 factions. <br />
<br />
Like I doubt in a WoW 2 or a Warcraft 4 that the Forsaken or Blood Elves would even still be with The Horde.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think one needs to, no, but the thing is: because he lost the trust of the elements he passed the hammer on. So the Doomhammer is now in the hands (actually the bank) of Notthrall or some other random shaman player, and Thrall no longer has it. So while maybe he could wield it as a normal hammer, he don't have it.<br />
<br />
Of course, nothing is beyong retconning, if Blizzard wants to.</div></div><hr />

The Doomhammer originally belonged to Orgrim Doomhammer and he was not a Shaman. The Doomhammer is in no way tied to the elements, but they did some kind of shenanigans in Legion to imply it was so because it was an artifact. Thrall probably just left it behind because he no longer wanted the responsibility, not because he couldn't physically use it.</div></div><hr />

My guess is Sylvanas deduced where Saurfang was going - he was heading from Stormwind to the Swamp of Sorrows and... since there isn't really anything that could be helpful to Saurfang in that part of the world except the Dark Portal, it was pretty clear he was going to Outland. And the most likely reason Saurfang would go there is to fetch Thrall. I imagine the idea was for the assassins to get to Thrall before Saurfang does.</div></div><hr />

Ahh k, was never sure and since it was not a shaman weapon per se it is weird to make it one for Legion.. I suppose they could not find a notable shaman melee weapon for enhancement shamans..</div></div><hr />

Might be more in line with “Saurfang escapee! Where will he go? Watch Thrall. If he gives asylum to our enemy then kill them both.”<br />
To the Rogues going to watch him, they had their opportunity.<br />
They might not even have been sent to kill Thrall but more likely kill Saurfang and just incapacitate or sound Thrall so he couldn’t interfere. You know, Sylvanas hunting down and killing a traitor that’s not n the loose.<br />
Again, being sent to Thrall’s location doesn’t mean they went to kill him as it could have been a reconnasaince job.<br />
In the cinematic, it was obvious one of them had poison tipped blades as you see the green tint coming off the blades, where as with Thrall there was none of that. Maybe I just missed it as I watched the video with a bit of a glare, but with Saurfang it was definitely prominently seen.</div></div><hr />

How is that a problem? If the idea was to kill Thrall before Saurfang got to him, Saurfang knowing about the assassins heading to Thrall doesn't really change much as apparently both Saurfang and the rogues got there pretty much around the same time. Or the assassins realized Saurfang was trailing them and decided to set up an ambush for both him and Thrall. <br />
<br />
Also, Saurfang saying that he was following the assassins implies that they weren't after him, but after Thrall.</div></div><hr />

But we've never seen Thrall in one of these HD cinematics, you cannot be the judge on whether its wrong or not. Also, Thrall IS old now. He's not as old as Saurfang, no, but Thrall is very much not a young orc anymore. Beside that, Thrall looks BANGER in this cinematic! He even grew out long hair again.</div></div><hr />

1. it was clearly a joke<br />
2. I essentially has no shamanistic power as of Legion, and he was a Warrior before he was a shaman - not to mention his bulkier appearance and two handed weapon, it's quite likely they're going back to Warrior thrall.<br />

Thrall was seemed to be more an enhancement shaman (specs don't exist in lore but you get my point) from vanilla to wrath - he wore heavy armor but did use some shaman abilities. From Cata he seemed to use spells far more often until Legion where his power was pretty much non-existent<br />

Like, I get that the budget for 2 more CGI characters would be crazy but we're not even mentioning that? Thrall and Saurfang just communicated that there were only 2 rogues and not an extra one going after Thrall's family? Saurfang is really so sure of his scouting/tracking skills that they don't even wanna check?<br />
<br />
I liked the cinematic, though. Looked really good, even if it is basicly another nod to MoP, where Chen (?) helps out Vol'jin and one of them has us alert Thrall of the current situation. The attention to detail was neat aswell, like when Saurfang grabbed the wheat and it sorta died, really shows why Outland can't be a home for the orcs anymore.</div></div><hr />

Not liking a story doesn't mean you think you could do better. This mentality is so confusing. Lots of BFA lore doesn't make sense and is a let down, this just isn't part of that.

I mostly agree with your statement, but most of the complaints I can see, at least on these forums, are, at best, not really well documented, or more generally quite dumb.

Ah yes, because treason is so not controversial. It speaks volumes about people mentality. Reality is edgy, but I guess they don't show it on carebears show.<br />

Since when was Thrall a traitor? Him defending himself against Sylvanas' assassins is apparently being marked as a traitor.<br />

Well... I'd rather be a traitor than dead. And in death, you can even become a puppet for Sylvanas...<br />

I'm so glad the Horde is getting it's true Warchief back. Lich Bitch is done boys.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling it was not her, but this is based on how those rogues looked like, their face, some kind of undead elf. <br />
I more and more start to believe that something has taken over Sylvanas, something dark from below. I hope it is true and I also hope that they are not bringing Thrall back to send him to die :/<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
The render quality has been improving massively in the last couple of years, but now even the detail level is outstanding. Even from the BfA cinematic to this there are some serious enhancements.<br />
<br />
I wonder if we will get to see a second Warcraft movie, only this time fully renderized? It seems like a waste to keep upgrading the otherwise already neat graphics, merely for cinematic. They could truly create a mind blowing movie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the Warcraft cinematic is still canon, so we've already seen Thrall, years, years ago (fighting side-by-side with Grommash against Mannoroth). Okay that's an old cinematic but that's HD equivalent.<br />
<br />
Regarding the whole &quot;Thrall traitor&quot; point of view, I don't really care, but the fact he abandoned the Horde and went hiding in darkest times make him a coward (and that's even more true if you look at that under Orc standards).<br />
<br />
I hope there are some explanation about why Sylvanas wanted to kill Thrall. It seemed to me the two Rogues were after Saurfang but he just took the opportunity to lie to Thrall in order to push him to join the rebellion. If Sylvanas wanted Thrall dead, she wouldn't wait for the greatest Warrior of Azeroth to be near him.<br />
<br />
Overall a bit underwhelmed by this cinematic. Top-notch quality as always, but I was far more impressed by the two previous ones. This one feels like a backstory and basically some kind of fan-service video (woohoo, Thrall ! woohoo, Nagrand ! woohoo, undead rogues !).<br />
<br />
Edit: and I'll forever be sad we'll probably never get to see legendary antagonists in HD. Just imagine Kil'Jaeden, Archimonde, Sargeras or even a random Sha with this quality. Dayum.<br />
<br />
Edit2: re-watching the cinematic, Thrall seems suspicious when Saurfang asks where the family is before his enigmatic &quot;not far&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still feel like ending the faction conflict with the arbitrary Horde vs Alliance would actually allow for some storytelling that lets players be MORE evil.<br />
<br />
If they wanted to explore the branching story idea that they're toying with on this Saurfang stuff, imagine taking that to higher levels with entire quest chains through certain zones being based on which path you chose to take. The quest chain for being good in Zone 2 being a direct result of the quest chain for being evil in Zone 1 type stuff. So good players get quest chains that are a &quot;result&quot; of the storyline for players doing evil stuff in previous chains.<br />
<br />
And regardless of which faction you're primarily with, you could still make some good and evil choices.<br />
<br />
It's a hard as hell line to walk in an MMO since ultimately all choice has to be an illusion and can't impact the bigger story's conclusion, but having player choice in smaller stories within the world that don't impact the larger narrative could definitely be explored.<br />
<br />
Another option would be to take a page from SWTOR and FFXIV and do more with class stories that take place at various points through leveling/expansion content and let those have more player choice.</div></div><hr />

Mate you read spoilers and that's cool but that is not a template buy the trends in media. Ultimately they are right. I'm not a fan of self exile but things usually aren't rainbows and sunshine. Personally U still hope the leaks were wrong and Dany will sit on the throne and keep it but we'll see. The same leaks predicted Qyuburn to become one of X king advisor.

<br />
But to summarize this video - Sylvanas sent her assassins after Thrall. Now, as much as I don't like Sylvanas and would love to see her go, it was actually a valid strategic decision to go after Thrall. After all, he most likely still has a lot of sympathizers within the Horde and should he choose to come back, he'd be a legit threat to Sylvanas' rule.<br />
<br />
Sylvanas considers everything a threat to her rule.<br />
In Before the Storm she was wary about the Darkspear producing a leader who can challenge her</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first phrases uttered by Thrall after Saurfang says &quot;So this is where you live now&quot; are this: &quot;Home. Family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which is exactly what Caesar says to Jason Clarke in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. &quot;Home. Family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thrall even says it the same way... slurring the F in family slightly... &quot;Home. Ffffamily.&quot; Just like in the movie<br />

<br />
Cheers for that, now I'm only wondering how Saurfang got there considering the Dark Portal was linked to WoD's timeline the last time it was active and we haven't had any confirmation it was relinked to Outland or how that would even be possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
you have no idea about that place and you talk for Saurfang.<br />
<br />
I legitimately couldn't tell if it was meant to be a place from Outland or somewhere in the barrens near the Cataclysm fault line with all the floating rocks in the background. I wanted to know so I could gauge how well Thrall was &quot;hiding&quot; considering this is the first I've heard of him doing this since Legion and I would think it'd be pretty silly of him to claim to be hiding if he was in the barrens. Also there's been no indication until this point that Assassins have been sent after anyone but Saurfang so for Saurfang to claim they were after Thrall is the biggest load coming from him. So yes he's straight up lying to his Old Warchief for the Alliance.</div></div><hr />

He said he doesn't want it, and Saurfang made it clear that that isn't what the Horde wants either.<br />
<br />
That aside, there really isn't much Blizzard can do with Sylvanas now. Either all these people are against her and she's within the right, meaning the majority of the Horde leadership is going to die for treason (Very Unlikely) or she has proven herself evil beyond redemption sending assassins to kill Thrall, someone beloved by the Orcs, but completely uninvolved in anything. Hell, he fled Draenor completely and is living on TBC Nagrand. At this point, she's at a cartoon level of villainy. <br />
<br />
No one is going to accept and forgive her after this expansion. She either dies or flees the Horde becoming a bigger threat next expansion which we kill her in. She's like an amalgamation of Arthas, Garrosh, and Gul'dan all rolled into one shitty, off the wall, weak storied character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BUT:<br />
<br />
Toward the beginning of BFA or shortly before the devs said something along the lines of both factions being able to have pride in their side this expac.<br />
Unless you are an orc (or very possibly a Tauren or Troll) where is your faction pride coming from as Horde? Twice now we are being split apart for the sake of a leader apparently gone power mad, or something. Once again, apparently, Thrall is the only one who can save us. Is Thrall the only thing holding the Horde together, ever? How are the &quot;lesser races&quot; supposed to feel about this? How should this bring about faction pride?<br />
<br />
Not to mention the sort of questionable decision to write the same storyline twice now but instead of having lesser character be the big bad leader who needs to be brought down, instead choose a faction leader many people have loved for years. I'm just trying to find some out here that doesn't end in crushing Sylvanas or some hamfisted redemption plot and I can't see it.</div></div><hr />

The Doomhammer is in no way tied to the elements, but they did some kind of shenanigans in Legion to imply it was so because it was an artifact. Thrall probably just left it behind because he no longer wanted the responsibility, not because he couldn't physically use it.<br />
<br />
The Elements never left Thrall, Thrall lost his &quot;faith&quot;, his strength and conviction. The Elements do not care he used them to end Garrosh, they're beyond petty mortal quarrels. They left Thrall because like when they pulled away from Gul'Dan, they aren't about to lend their strength to a weak willed Orc. Should Thrall find himself and call on the Elements, they will answer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is Thrall hiding in Nagrand?<br />
How Saurfang got there?<br />
Why Sylvanas want to kill Thrall?<br />
<br />
Nothing makes any sense.<br />
<br />
ok, first after WoD Thrall lost his conection with the elements (all bc he used the elements to kill Garrosh), after Legion he step down from the horde all together and when live on Nagrand with his wife and son. <br />
<br />
Outland and Azeroth and connected trow the dark portal, so you can still go there, i mean on canon, isnt like the way Alternate Dreanor was, that on canon was 1 time going. <br />
<br />
Sylvanas probably is after Thrall, base on what happen after she trap Baine, if you speak with the other Horde heroes there, you can see Rexxar saying he need to inform someone about what going on, knowing Sylvana she have ppl looking after each major horde figure, so probably she know Thralls is a problem for her plans. Plus she really never buy the whole story about Saurfang been death.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's roughly my thoughts on the matter, too. I mean, wasn't he 'closer to the elements than any other shaman'? He was literally broken into elemental versions of himself, and then all of those version were fused back into a single whole. He because the 'World-Shaman' and stood in for a fucking Aspect. The Elements don't just abandon someone like that because he broke the rules of a tradition that isn't theirs in the first place, on a planet that isn't theirs either.</div></div><hr />

I want you to understand that you've probably been playing this game for many years, and the way games are made change and adapt to the audience that plays it, and alter based on the staff making the game. What this means is that you are sitting here bitching about a game you don't like anymore, nearly demanding it change back to how it was, because you liked that game more. I like this game fine how it is, but if you don't, then you need to adjust your expectations, or move on. <br />
<br />
WoW is what it is. If you think it's too simple, or you don't like it, or the story or wahtever you gripe is, you're better served to just move on.<br />

<br />
But to summarize this video - Sylvanas sent her assassins after Thrall. Now, as much as I don't like Sylvanas and would love to see her go, it was actually a valid strategic decision to go after Thrall. After all, he most likely still has a lot of sympathizers within the Horde and should he choose to come back, he'd be a legit threat to Sylvanas' rule.<br />
<br />
I would agree with this if we actually saw Sylvanas doing it and it's not Saurfang being an orc and orcs, as we know, are very easy to manipulate.<br />
<br />
A friendly reminder, Vol'jin put Sylvanas to Warchief throne. Thrall accepted Sylvanas to the Horde.</div></div><hr />

Khadgar has/had some weird aging spell on him thanks to his old master. So while he looked like Gandalf during BC, he was still pretty young. Not sure if he got it under control of he's Benjamin Button now. The others though? Who knows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I and others have pointed out, there’s no evidence they were actually there to kill Thrall. Yes, they very well could have been sent by Syl with plans to stop a potential rebellion with him or even to make it look like Alli did it to rally the Horde behind her.<br />
The flip side is that she sent them to just watch Thrall in case Saurfang showed up. Seeing as how they attacked they were there to kill Saurfang when he appeared. You know, common tactic to watch people your enemies might go to when seeking refuge or allies to help them. <br />
I also pointed out the Rogue attacking Saurfang clearly has poison coming off their daggers, whereas Thrall’s attacker appears to be normal blades. Possibly more for keeping Thrall busy or to cause a no lethal injury while the other is trying to kill a traitor.<br />
Either way, I hope Blizz clarifies at some point as most people seem to think she wanted to kill Thrall, which I am completely open to admit as a possibility/</div></div><hr />

Lore-wise, you're a sneaky bastard. That's how you're not noticed 2 feet away.<br />
<br />
You know how to hide yourself behind cover, and can move silently. The idea behind stealth is to play into the assassination part of rogue, which has NEVER required full invisibility. That way, you simply get close, close the gap, then assassinate the target. And then you disappear back behind cover.<br />
<br />
It has never been about invisibility. If rogues could be fully invisible, what's stopping them from assassinating everyone in their sleep whenever they feel like it? In fact, now that we know it is, why hasn't Sylvanas just sent assassins to murder all of us in our sleep, since they're invisible?<br />
<br />
They could literally wait in our rooms till we went to sleep and we'd have no idea. Because they're literally fucking invisible.</div></div><hr />

Watching the undead slip into and out of invisibility right in front of people was a bit stupid.<br />
Actually to others it DOES make you invisible if you are out of range of them.<br />

I know stealth is meant to work differently, but I don't see why it can't be essentially rogues using a bit of dark magic themselves to literally become invisible in dark environments. Yeah, in broad daylight it is stupid to see, but at night or in places like Duskood when they can use the shadows to their advantage with some dark magic aid? Why not?<br />
<br />
Awesome cinematic. I love how people keep bringing up Saurfang's past. Yeah, he was a piece of shit, and he himself has admitted that much, and has spent his older years trying to atone for it. It doesn't justify what Sylvanas is doing. I really hope the story goes in a place where Saurfang and Thrall smash that bitch's face in with a great big hammer.</div></div><hr />

The idea of them being &quot;just very sneaky&quot; went right out the window when Blizzard removed the run speed penalty for stealth, and added a speed buff to it through a talent.. basically allowing you to move faster while stealthed.<br />
<br />
So you now somehow move faster while being as careful as possible to not make a sound while moving or brush into objects or avoiding lights, etc, etc...</div></div><hr />

That says 7.0, which was legion. And 8.2 is dealing with Azshara. Doubt she's getting her own expansion.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
We already knew Thrall is coming back, so now we know exactly how and why. <br />
<br />
But to summarize this video - Sylvanas sent her assassins after Thrall. Now, as much as I don't like Sylvanas and would love to see her go, it was actually a valid strategic decision to go after Thrall. After all, he most likely still has a lot of sympathizers within the Horde and should he choose to come back, he'd be a legit threat to Sylvanas' rule.<br />
<br />
Actually no. He wasn't remotely a threat to her rule. First off I don't think she's paranoid about losing control of the horde. She just doesn't wanna die because she's terrified of it. Killing thrall would not benefit her in any way. All it'd do is unite all the thrall sympathisers against her and put her life in increased jeopardy she wouldn't even be safe in Ogrimmar. If she were to assassinate him sending rogues equip with forsaken made blades seems like a really dumb idea. It'd be better to send them to poison his ale so it looks like natural causes. Also if Saurfang followed assassins stalking out Thrall why wasn't the very first thing he said was &quot;WATCH OUT I SAW ASSASSINS COMING FOR YOU!!!!&quot; Not say nothing until they show up and are killed so they can't answer any questions. That's sketchy. Though TBPH I don't think he set up the assassins, he may have. Been I see it as more opprotunic. Extra way to convince him is &quot;See how evil she is? She literally sent assassins after you!&quot;. I find it more likely that it is the twilight hammer's doing. As N'zoth is gonna want the horde and alliance broken so they can't stop him. So either that really pretty CGI video had some of the worst writing I've ever seen in anything (including most porno) or there is something sketch going on.</div></div><hr />

July 9th raid?</div></div><hr />

aren't friends with Saurfang right now, and he has NOTHING to gain from lying to Thrall, so could you guys please not keep harping<br />
on that? It's beyond retarded.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Saurfang enjoyed killing the defenseless civilians when the horde attacked stormwind during the second war, he said so himself. He is a piece of shit who enjoyes murdering defencless women and children for fun.<br />
<br />
That was when he had drunk the blood of Mannoroth, and was under a demonic influence.<br />
<br />
There's a scene in Borean Tundra where Saurfang tells Garrosh what happened when the Orcs attacked the Draenei,<br />
and how once Mannorth's influence was gone, a lot of the old Orcs were horrified and suicidal for committing so<br />
many attrocities.<br />
<br />
It was Saurfang who helped them, and even he himself says he doesn't eat pork anymore, because it reminds him<br />
of the sound the children make.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you actually knew anything about the lore, you'd already know this.<br />
<br />
Which you don't.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I followed them&quot; BWAAA HA HA HA HA HAA suuuuuuuuuuuuuure you did.. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Yeah because a war veteran like Saurfang who has a lifetime of combat experience in tactics and warfare couldn't<br />
possibly know anything about stealth, hunting, and/or tracking. I mean what would someone who's had the title/rank<br />
of General know anything about that stuff?<br />
<br />
Nope. How unrealistic.<br />
