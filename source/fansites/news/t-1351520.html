Patch 5.4 Raid Finder and Flex Drop Rates<br />

<br />
<br />
Upcoming Pet Changes<br />
We have a few hotfixes to share with you and these changes should be in game now, or will take effect once the realms have been restarted:<br />
<br />
<br />
Pierre (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/70082-pierre) and Rascal-Bot (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/71693-rascal-bot) are no longer Bind on Pickup; they can now be caged and you can collect up to 3 of each.<br />
Rascal-Bot's Phaser spell is now a one-round ability. The tooltip still erroneously states that it is a two-round ability which we plan to correct at a later date.<br />
Jadefire Spirit's Fade ability now has an eight-round cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />

Raid Finder Difficulty<br />
You would think with all this LFR SoO complaints that Blizzard would get the message but they're still in denial... <br />
You may have missed my second post (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10093319358?page=5#86). Or are you dismissing a lack of immediate change and specific hotfix notes as indifference? <br />
<br />
This guy gets it. You don't make people better players by smoothing to road for them. You do it by handing them a shovel and saying &quot;here's the tools, fix it yourself&quot;. <br />
That's an unfortunately common outlook, that if you just made stuff harder for people they'd aspire to greatness. But we know that's not how it works for everyone, or how all people respond to challenges, or necessarily what everyone is even looking for in their entertainment. We're getting into social commentary territory which I'd like to avoid, but let's dismiss the notion that any of us &quot;know what's best&quot; for any other person, and instead accept their preferences as absolutely valid, and think and discuss about what the issues and solutions are from that viewpoint instead of focusing on how to tell other people they're enjoying their game incorrectly. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/272062-state-of-lfr-not-a-remove-it-qq/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10093319358?page=24#470))<br />

Patch 5.4 and Deterrence<br />
I understand why there would be some confusion about Deterrence's function in 5.4. And yes, it's a nerf in cases where you were using it more or less on cooldown every minute for longer than about 4 minutes. <br />
<br />
However, in cases where you'd like to use it more than once inside a 1-minute period, the new Deterrence is a significant buff. Previously, that couldn't be done without using Readiness, and the vast majority of players weren't saving Readiness for Deterrence.<br />
<br />
It's different now, sure, but we like how the new version is working. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/272320-im-calling-you-out-on-this-mess-up-fix-it/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10104710390?page=4#71))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
Why don't you make all raid modes share the same lockout? That way they won't have to hate such an awesome feature. <br />
We like the idea that e.g. a HC guild could run a flex on another night for those folks who care about achievements. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374953613614776320))<br />
FWIW, in 5.0 when my old guild was dead, LFR was the only way I was able to run those raids. So I am all for it<br />
I am a HC raider, but if I log on an alt at 10 AM on a Sun, I don't want to have to look for guildies. LFR works great for that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374972044066041856))<br />
<br />
Do you think that this bias towards / insistence on larger raids leads to overemphasizing AE heals as a necessary consequence?<br />
In 10s it's easier to coordinate and 25s easier to specialize, which leads to just doing one thing over and over. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373931392473653249))<br />
I believe 25s are more fun personally and think better for the game strategically, but concede healing more fun in 10s. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373931247820476416))<br />
I feel 10s are better socially. 25 is too many people I don't know well enough to care about or listen to.<br />
Some truth to that, but 10s also have to be more selective &amp; are less resilient to losing folks. In that way, 25s good for social. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373977323990573056))<br />
seems the changes your making 10 man's are becoming worthless and second place to 25 man raids. how long b4 10 mans are gone<br />
10s are in no danger of going anywhere. 25s remain in danger despite the advantages you are worried about. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374969238718386176))<br />
<br />
so the next xpac will be another cataclysm, you had this talk before that launch about difficulty and need to change<br />
No, the problem with Cat was there was no alternatives to HC dungeons. As I said, exclusive is fine as long as alternative exist. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373886468952817666))<br />
That has me worried. The early cata zones is what made me leave last time!<br />
Zones (meaning the outdoor leveling content) or dungeons? The discussion was about dungeons.... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374950856426139648))<br />
<br />
does the vast diversity of player skill pose problems in content design?<br />
Absolutely. Often players can use gear (which is generally a function of time invested) to help make up the difference. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374949075218472960))<br />
<br />
Why not open heroics first week so heroic guilds dont load up on Ngear with multiple raids and the tiers last a little longer?<br />
Seeing the encounters for one week in normal helps us catch last minute problems. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/380064591050321921))<br />
Imagine first kill of a heroic boss was 60 sec without cheating. Do we then buff the boss? Do we strip them of their kill? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/380064856553947136))<br />
<br />
If organized gameplay is &quot;the heart and soul&quot; of wow, why is only a minority part of this &quot;heart and soul&quot;?<br />
Queuing for random matchmaking is very convenient. Our concern is that those players burn out quickly without social connections. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/379726622800089088))<br />
<br />
why the hell can i get a cloak off ordos when you need a legendary cloak to even fight him. Waste of a drop.<br />
You can access Ordos if any character on your account has a cloak I believe. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/379725637138661376))<br />

I think that normal raids should not be possible to clear on first week of patch release and that if a heroic raid boss can be downed without a majority of members with most of their BiS normal gear, then something is not right and the content is too easy. skill alone should not be enough to clear normal nor to down any heroic boss. I also believe that all gear drops on a dungeon and raid boss should have the same chance to drop. seeing the same thing drop almost everytime and the one piece you or someone on the team needs never drops except when that person is not present is stupid.</div></div><hr />

I limit myself to two runs per week ... it is painful enough doing that. I cannot even fathom having the time to do that many runs, much less the patience that would be required.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really think they want LFR to quickly lead to realm PUG Flex modes. They don´t want people doing LFR for 3 months and still get upgrades.. they probably want them to do it for 1 month, and then feel comfortable joining realm pugs and move up to Flex. In the past, there really wasn´t much opportunity for upward mobility like that for the typical LFR player.<br />
<br />

<br />
Before SoO launched, I was so excited because the very first boss dropped my weapon ( Bear druid). 3 weeks later, running Flex and LFR every week and using a bonus roll on that first boss every time, and even running FLex 3 times the first week just for the roll.... I now have an ilvl of 540, and still using a 510 weapon... lol.. I love RNG.<br />

<br />
I really think overall that is the biggest problem with LFR. Many people feel the need to gear up their alts in LFR, but then hate the idea of doing it 5 times... so they check-out once they get inside and have very short fuses when it comes to wipes. In my opinion, that is why Tuesdays are always much better. you have people who are doing it for the first time of the week, and still mentally involved. By Saturday, the people who only do LFR with 1 character are done, and all you have are people who are on their 3rd of 5th run of the week on alts that don´t play much.</div></div><hr />

Hmm I think it's very safe to keep that 20% drop rate for ToT instead of 16% you mentioned. The page of Treasures of the Thunder King also indicates that it's less than 80% chance to have a loser bag from any boss.</div></div><hr />

That's twice I've killed each boss from wing 1 on both toons and one go thru of the 2nd wing on each. 25% drop rate my ass. RNG hates me when it comes to upgrading my gear. I swear.

10s are in no danger of going anywhere. 25s remain in danger despite the advantages you are worried about.<br />
<br />
am i the only person who thinks that if 25 man was worth playing, it wouldn't need protecting?</div></div><hr />

There should be a built in counter displaying how many times a player has missed out on gear. Once this counter reaches a threshold like 4 bosses the next boss...boom loot. Both wings of flex and raid finder for 2 weeks and I have received 2 items, that's 2 items on 20 boss kills. Looking a little more like 10% to me.</div></div><hr />

Hmm I think it's very safe to keep that 20% drop rate for ToT instead of 16% you mentioned. The page of Treasures of the Thunder King also indicates that it's less than 80% chance to have a loser bag from any boss.<br />
<br />
The drop rates on Treasures of the Thunder King (http://www.wowdb.com/items/95343-treasures-of-the-thunder-king) are for all difficulties, you need to see the actual boss page and select LFR to just see LFR data. The 16% is adjusted from what you can see on WoWDB (~18%) due to an addon error that threw things slightly off.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it ever would. Although the illustrator mentioned about something that would force the two to work together, it would have to be HUGE in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AFAIK everything is supposed to have the same drop chance (tier tokens aside unless they changed it since MoP), however it was suggested some time ago (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7713981889) (see post 2) that Blizz's RNG code makes the same things happen in a row more often than it should. I dunno if this affects the loot tables from week-to-week (it certainly looks that way) but it surely causes 2-3 of the same item dropping off a boss far more often than it should, given the tiny odds of such a thing happening. (multiple drops of the same item should never have been applied to non-tier items in the first place, never mind the fact that the code seems to favour it)</div></div><hr />

Players will always take the path of least resistance. 10s are much easier to organize, therefore will be done more. The problem is from a design perspective, the game is more fun playing in 25 man mode and the encounters can be more interesting with more people.<br />
<br />
it isn´t about protecting 25ms, it is just about finding the proper reward balance to counteract the fact that 25s are harder to organize.<br />

Are you joking. The forums are filled with threads from raiders crying about cloaks being on the loot tables of bosses. Like half the posts a few days ago were tears on that issue.<br />
<br />
I agree about people being silly complaining about bad RNG after only a few weeks, but this is hardly just LFR people who cry about loot.</div></div><hr />

I feel that the logical thing to assume would be that he wants it to be the other way around, having PvE match the loot system of PvP. But hey, just jump at the chance at making fun of people, it makes you seem bright.<br />

<br />
You need to understand statistics a little more. The odds of you getting the exact same item off of a boss two times in a row is actually fairly high depending on the loot table and your spec. On most bosses, probably 25% or 33%. (and just for the statistically challenged, there is a difference between getting ´the same´ item two times in a row, then getting ´a certain item two times in a row´. The problem is just with human perception.. we remember those things much more than we do the normal cases where we get a different item.<br />
<br />
And to say Blizz´s RNG code is bad is just ignorant talk from people with no programming experience. These guys have programmed stuff like phasing, connected realms and some really crazy stuff... an RNG seed is very very basic stuff that is used and shared everywhere in programming and has been tested trillions of times. One guy saying ´omg, I got the same item 3 times in a row, Blizzards RNG is busted´ is kid´s talk.<br />

Well, the devs have already commented on that many times. And obviously with no VP gear this patch they are moving away from that model. One dev mentioned recently that they felt it wasn´t as exciting to go shopping for gear 2 hours after a raid as it was to loot your sword from the corpse of a dead dragon.<br />
<br />
This entire topic is just a bunch of whiners saying ´OMG, I want this new item and I didn´t get it the first 2 weeks´... Like I said, I have been the victim of terrible RNG this patch. Overall ilvl 540, weapon still at 510?? despite the fact that my weapon drops from the very first boss and I have used every stone, every week on that boss? But you just have to keep it in perspective.. on Tuesday, I have 5, or maybe 6 more rolls on that first boss ( and yes, I have won the helm twice already and fully expect to win another).<br />
<br />
You know what is really unfun? if there is a store somewhere that sells my weapon and I can say ´wow, I only need to kill 9 more bosses and I will be able to buy it´.. That is boring. Blizzard has already given us a bad RNG dampener in the form of bonus rolls, they allow us to pick and chose which boss we want a better chance at.<br />
<br />
This is just one of those things where players would make the game very boring if he got his way. Sorry, I want my weapon to come to me with dragon guts spilled on it, not with gift-wrapping and a price tag from an NPC store.</div></div><hr />

Nope, I read that thread. It was LFR people who have the cloak getting angry about Ordos dropping a cloak when you need the legendary to fight him. <br />

<br />
Apparently not. The developers keep this system in place for pvp. Why can't pvp have the same fun as everyone else? Aren't they just as deserving? Why not simple have a bg give a chance to drop a piece of loot? <br />
<br />
The developers insistence on RNG drives players (specifically casual players) away. Who in gods name want's to waste their time for little to no reward? THEIR WAS NOTHING WRONG with buying my gear from a valor vendor. It gave me an alternative progression path that wasn't some horrid RNG abomination. You like getting your gear from bosses okay go forth and do that. No reason you can't do that and I can't have a valor vendor. You know what's really boring? Killing the same fucking boss over and over again for no gain at all. Constant frustration gets boring. After awhile you stop giving a fuck and then bye bye sub. I honestly cannot understand how you find a system ENTIRELY OUT OF YOUR CONTROL more interesting then a system where you have some measure of control in how you get the gear you want to get. You're not g etting the loot off the boss, you're getting the loot off some artificial dice roll machine in the background. I'd love to get the loot of the boss, if that actually happened but it doesn't. Who in their right fucking mind writes a fantasy novel and after the hero kills the dragon or black knight or whatever they get NOTHING out of it. Like wtf kinda fantasuy is that? It's a non fantasy. The heroes ALWAYS EXPECT a reward from killing the boss not simple a chance at a reward. Going back to even fantasy archetypes. Siegfried doesn't kill fafnir because some programmer somewhere gives him a 5% chance at loot. Siegfried kills fafnir full well knowing he will gain strength from it.<br />
<br />
It's a fucking terrible fantasy robbing immersion killing system. The VENDOR was better. You can at least understand a world where you buy stuff from people for an acquired currency. People do that everyday. The constant cock block rng has NOTHING to do with the &quot;fantasy&quot; or the fun of the issue, it has everything to do with naked and obvious attempt to stretch out content that has little depth in an vein effort to keep subs retained and shove players into raiding. It's fucking terrible and I hope they lose millions of subs over the loss of the valor vendor. I mean I've got lots of criticism about the game but if I could rewind one thing it would be all the changes made to valor. It's a painfully stupid fucking regression to the game that wasn't necessary. It's TERRIBLE.</div></div><hr />

10 man is is just as hard as 25 man because you can only make 1 mistake maybe 2 and then it wipes on 25 man you can have more fuck ups as well as more healers to catch the dmg of mistakes I think your opinion is wrong and have a feeling you never did 10 man</div></div><hr />
