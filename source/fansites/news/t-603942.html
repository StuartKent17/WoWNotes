Transmutation Mastery Issue<br />
Sad day for alchemists, you're officially bugged.<br />
As of the 2.3 content patch, there's currently an issue with Transmutation Mastery by which the percentage chance to receive additional results from transmutations — aside from Transmute: Primal Might — is lower than the intended value. This is likely contributing to the dearth of procs you've observed, and I'd like to offer my apologies for any consternation that has arisen as a result of the discrepancy. I'm happy to report that this matter should be resolved in a future patch, but your continued patience in the interim is appreciated. :)<br />

Professions leveling<br />
It seems that the 2.4 will make leveling some professions easier, especially the gathering ones. (and cooking !)<br />
Concerning there being some leveling bumps for mining nearing the end of pre-BC, it's planned to be smoothed out along with other professions. Some professions have already seen changes in this regard, and we're certainly planning to continue them so that there's no need to stop leveling, go back and a zone, and do circuits until you're caught up. That really shouldn't be necessary, and yes, isn't fun.<br />
<br />
In general those changes mean lengthening the amount of time each type of ore would give skill ups, so that you can consistently get skillups or even go a bit beyond where you should be for your level before you have to move on, smoothing the transitions.<br />

US Servers - Free Character Transfer<br />
More free character transfers are now available, it almost feels like christmas. <br />
We will be offering free character moves from selected high population realms to other, lower populated realms to assist in population dispersal. The ability to move a character on the selected source realms will become available on Friday, December 21 at 12:01 PM PST, and are scheduled to run until Friday, December 28 at 12:01 PM PST.<br />
<br />
In the event that a realm meets our transfer goals before the scheduled end date, the transfers to that realm will be disabled. We highly recommend that if you are planning to transfer that you do so at your earliest convenience.<br />
<br />
Once the transfers open you can begin your transfer by visiting the Character Move page located here: https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html (https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html)<br />
<br />
The realms chosen consist of source realms with the highest sustained queues, and destination realms with the lowest population. The numbers gathered are directly from our data, and depict the realms in most need of these transfers. We will be continuing to monitor all realms and open additional free transfers in the future where necessary.<br />

Cooking<br />
&quot;Cooking was recently actually smoothed out, to making leveling easier, however in some spots this meant that recipes weren't carrying as far as they needed to. The end result did the opposite of what was intended. It's something we're aware of and will be fixing.&quot; (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3547877990&amp;postId=35473991841&amp;sid=1#7))<br />

Gnome: Escape Artist<br />
The fail rate of Escape Artist is confirmed to be 1%, it's always been here and it's not a 2.3 nerf. However if you feel that it's higher than that you can always post a bug report on the Bug forums.

Tier 3 Models in Naxxramas<br />
&quot;As much as you may not like the idea of reusing an armor set with a new color, we feel it definitely helps the overall development of the game and the new content we are continually implementing.

<br />
<br />
Yes, maybe :) I think the problem is not skilling mining for blacksmithing, it is the sheer amount of ores you need. Engineering is much more difficult because you need a lot different mats e.g. leather or gems. What i wanted to say is that there was never a problem to skill the gathering professions compared to the crafting ones but the gathering ones will be buffed :)</div></div><hr />
