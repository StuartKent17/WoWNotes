Wrath of the Lich King - Talent Calculator<br />
The Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/) has been updated for the launch of Wrath of the Lich King ! <br />
<br />
The interface looks a bit nicer, most of the text links have been replaced by nice buttons<br />
Glyphs are now included in the template! Now that all the Glyphs are available in game it makes sense to add them to the calculator.<br />
Tons of new bugs have been added for your enjoyment. We'll fix them throughout the night but just like anything I launch it wasn't tested intensively before going live, the first 10 people who report bugs in comments are getting a hug.<br />
Just like the old talent calculator, it's not supposed to be compatible with IE6 and you will have to upgrade your browser (and make thousands of webmaster happy by doing it)<br />
<br />
Already known bugs include funny behavior of glyph tooltips (clicking will always work, your mouse cursor/item tooltip might just not update), you can report everything else. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Irbis</div><div class="date">2008-11-13, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like the glyph thing. ^^ But i have some kind of idea here... Just a little concept. Photoshoped, ofc - i don't know javascript enough to do it actually. :P Image is clickable. <br />
<br />
http://feq.ru/talants_spells_mini.jpg (http://feq.ru/talants_spells.jpg)<br />
<br />
The point is to combine spells list with talent calñ in some way (not to just remove spells list - it has a bit different function). It's usually hard to keep in mind what talant changes what spell and in which way. So there could be something like dinamic spell list, which will update while you picking talants. Got new spell from your talant build? it will be added below. Got 2 points in, for example, improved earth shield? The spell below resto tree will show that Earth Shild has 8 charges (maybe it could be highlighted by color that it was changed or show somewhere default value). Ideal would be, ofc, if we could also insers somewhere main stats - like spell power, int, stamina, etc, and it will also cause spells to change. <br />
I know it's most likely very hard to implement in technical way, and maybe even almost impossible. But i think that'd be cool... theoreticly. ^^ Anyway, i was just bored on work... :P</div></div><hr />
