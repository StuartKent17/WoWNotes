New Valor Points and Daily Dungeons gains in Patch 4.1<br />
We finally have a blue posts about the changes to daily quests!<br />
Right now, you receive 70 VP for the first random Cataclysm Heroic dungeon you complete each day. In 4.1, you'll receive 70 VP for the first seven random Cataclysm Heroic dungeons you complete each week. Similarly, you'll receive 140 VP for the first seven random Rise of the Zandalari Heroic dungeons (the new Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub instances) you complete in the week, too. Collectively, you'll be able to earn up to 980 VP exclusively from Heroic dungeons, which in turn will count towards your weekly 1250 VP cap.<br />
<br />
By transitioning random Heroic dungeon rewards from a daily format to a weekly one, we'll be able to give players more control and flexibility over how they can earn VP -- which is cool! -- but this also means that we've a lot more bookkeeping to do in terms of where those points are coming from. To help with that, we're adding a &quot;Valor Point bar&quot; (similar to an XP bar) to the top of Dungeon Finder UI that will track your weekly cap, as well as how many Heroics you can still run for VP during the week.<br />
<br />
We're going to be writing up a pretty big blog about that system since it's somewhat complicated, but here's what you can take away right now:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In 4.1, running random Heroic dungeons for VP is now something you can do on your own schedule. Feel like spending your entire Saturday queuing up as random? No problem!<br />
<br />
<br />
The first seven random Rise of the Zandalari Heroics you run for the week will award 140 VP each. This is double the VP that youâ€™ll receive from your first seven random &quot;tier 1&quot; Cataclysm Heroics, since the dungeons are considered a &quot;step up&quot; in difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
You'll be able to randomly queue for the Rise of the Zandalari Heroics separately from the tier 1 Cataclysm Heroic dungeons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Each week you can earn up to 980 VP just by running random Heroic dungeons. If you want to maximize your VP gains, you can still reach the overall weekly cap of 1250 by defeating raid level content.<br />
<br />
<br />
This isn't yet on the PTR for testing. We'll let you know when it is, though, and will continue to provide more information as the development of 4.1 progresses.<br />
<br />

RSA Vulnerability and Blizzard Authenticators<br />
The Blizzard Authenticators are based off modified Vasco tokens. I'm sorry to hear about RSA's troubles, but it will not affect the Blizzard Authenticator. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/164619/rsa-compromise-concerns-about-authenticators))<br />

People blocking mailboxes with flying mounts<br />
You may have noticed that a number of mailboxes were added to the capital cities so that, if you happen to find one blocked, it should be relatively easy to walk a few steps and find another one that remains unobstructed. Most vendors are located inside buildings where mounts aren't allowed too.<br />
<br />
Having the option to use one's flying mounts within the capital cities is ultimately more convenient than removing them to ensure access to services which should be reasonably accessible to begin with. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/164703/take-away-the-dragons))<br />
<br />
<br />
Heroic Instance Tiers<br />
But, yes. The Rise of the Zandalari Heroics are considered a tier above the current Cataclysm Heroics. You can randomly queue for them separately, but you'll still only be able to earn at most 980 VP per week from running Heroics, period (no matter what tier they are). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/164622/abolish-the-daily-valor-points-from-heroics))<br />
<br />
<br />
Reasons behind the change to daily dungeon<br />
Some people don't have time to log in every day, but have, for instance, a lot of time on the weekend to play.<br />
We hear you, and we agree that asking players log in every day (or night) just to keep pace with their VP is a bit unreasonable and can sometimes lead to World of Warcraft feeling less like a game and more like a job. That's ultimately why we're making these changes. We want you to log in because you enjoy raiding, or questing, or -- in this case -- running dungeons, not because you feel like you need to complete a specific chore every day in order to stay viable/competitive. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/164622/abolish-the-daily-valor-points-from-heroics))<br />
<br />
<br />
Amount of instances in a week<br />
It sounds like you meant that you could do 7 total heroics; not 7 tier 1 AND 7 ZG/ZA... so its possible to get a TOTAL of 980 VP (Source (It sounds like you meant that you could do 7 total heroics; not 7 tier 1 AND 7 ZG/ZA... so its possible to get a TOTAL of 980 VP))<br />
<br />
<br />
Hitting the cap with the new dungeon dailies<br />
Even with only doing the dungeons (both types), you'll hit the cap before the week is over, without stepping foot into a raid.<br />
Nah, you won't. You'll only be able to earn up to 980 VP per week from running random Heroics, not 1470 VP (we're purposefully placing a soft cap on VP from Heroics). If you want to reach the 1250 weekly cap, you'll still need to run raid content.<br />
<br />
Again, I know it's a bit complicated, so let me give you some examples:<br />
<br />
Example 1:<br />
Player A has a blast on a Friday with his friends and runs seven Rise of the Zandalari Heroics, earning 980 VP (7 x 140 VP). The next day, he helps a friend with a random tier 1 Cataclysm Heroic -- let's say Heroic Deadmines. Because player A has already earned 980 VP from random Heroics, he won't receive any VP from the Saturday's Deadmines run.<br />
<br />
Example 2:<br />
Player B kills 25-man Argaloth, Council of Wind, and Halfus Wyrmbreaker, earning 270 VP on Tuesday night. She then runs three random tier 1 Cataclysm Heroics during the workweek for 210 VP. Come Saturday, player B wants to kill LOTS of trolls and decides to chain-run a few random Rise of the Zandalari Heroics. At this point, player B has 770 VP available to be earned from Heroic dungeons (980 VP - 210 VP). This means she can run six of those dungeons -- for the first five, she'll get 140 VP; for the sixth, only 70 VP.<br />
<br />
Example 3:<br />
Player C raids a lot of bosses, killing 10 of them with 24 of his peers on Tuesday/Wednesday, earning 900 VP. He can still earn 350 VP before hitting the weekly cap. The 980 VP Heroic dungeon cap won't affect him at this point. He can do five tier 1 Heroics -- or three Rise of the Zandalari Heroics, or two Rise of the Zandalari Heroic + one tier 1 Heroic -- to earn those 350 VP.<br />
<br />
This is all much easier to understand with pictures (which we'll be sure include in spades in the blog post), but I hope the above makes sense for now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/164622/abolish-the-daily-valor-points-from-heroics))<br />

<br />
I don't think this is unacceptable at all. If you're in a good raiding guild making progress, you'll be picking up valor quickly as well as raid drops, possibly heroics (which you can't buy with valor) and on top of that, you have access to 140 VP random zg/za's as well. Also, unless they add 4pc t12 to the valor vendor in 4.2, you can get a decent selection of items to help you become raid ready, but you can't put a whole set together unless you actually raid.<br />
<br />
I see this as a huge buff for convenience of the players, as well as for gearing alts so that you can enjoy raids on multiple characters if you so choose, or at the very least you might have an acceptable substitute char if a healer is MIA come raid time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RokFenris</div><div class="date">2011-03-19, 03:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">im a bit confused, so the weekly VP cap is 1250 is that including raids. Because that would suck if it did.<br />
<br />
The Blue explained quite well. The 1250 cap is including raids and heroics. Heroics are soft capped at 980, and apparently only the first 7 heroics of each tier matter.<br />
Players can get up to 490 points if they run just the first tier heroics, up to 980 points if they also run the second tier heroics, and reach the 1250 cap if they also raid.<br />
<br />
If I was still playing, I would be quite happy with being able to reach 3/4 of the cap from just heroics. Really good change, and should reduce the gear gap between successful raiders and casual players - which I see as a very good thing for the game as a whole. After all, gifting the more experienced players with better performing gear is a sure recipe to have the content impossible to balance, as then the gear difference naturally nerfs it for the more experienced player, while keeping the initial, higher difficulty for the less experienced players.<br />
<br />
Now that points have a weekly cap, I think Blizzard should make a slight change - move the point grants to the bosses, keeping the weekly cap intact and roughly the current amount of points per dungeon. They could even make different bosses grant different amount of points, based on how difficulty they are and on the amount of trash that needs to be cleared to get to them. That way, optional bosses would be skipped way less, since beating them would make the run worth more points, and even players that don't complete the run (but did beat at least one boss) would have something to show for their effort.<br />
<br />
BTW, was just reading about Global Agenda (due to it's charity sales) and found the way it gives points quite interesting. Beating content grants points based on both the difficulty of the content and the time expected to beat the content - so a fast PvE instance actually gives less points than a long one, and the amount of points per hour should be roughly the same no matter which instances the player runs. It also grants points for failing at the content - between half and a quarter of the points for beating the content. I really liked the concept of having faster instances give more points.</div></div><hr />

I'm not, that's an easy PR victory. It gives them the chance to point out something they did to try and make players lives easier. When you know that a blue post will be replicated to a large number of fan sites, that's easy and free publicity. The CM who responded to it deserves credit for their astuteness, whether they did it on purpose or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
people who are crying about this change are bad players who are stuck doing normal mode content, working REALLY HARD for their SUPER COOL 359 gear. for everyone else its a huge convenience - casual players can get geared too, and the raiders can easily fill out the last few VP things they still need and start makin' dat boot money.<br />

cry more about &quot;casuals&quot;, people. if you still care about VP than you are either casual or in a bad guild... SORRY</div></div><hr />

What I find even funnier is it explains why they added so many extra mailboxes. Apparently this was enough of a problem that blizzard decided to correct the problem in their own fashion..ie add more boxes AND move the vendors indoors instead of banning flying mounts in capital cities.</div></div><hr />

The new heroics give 140. Current ones will still give 70. If you do 7 of the new ones, which give a greater reward for a much greater challenge and gear level, you will hit the HEROIC CAP of 980, and be unable to earn any more. <br />
<br />
Why do you feel entitled to anything whatsoever, simply because you spend more hours sitting at home playing a video game? That is the only argument you are making, and we would all appreciate if you would stop spewing out elitist garbage. I hit my VP cap from just raiding, and I have absolutely no problem with people running heroics for VP, just like they do now.</div></div><hr />

Good. &quot;But what about all the gear I get from raiding in Firelands in 4.2? All the heroic ppl will get the same!&quot; - No.<br />
<br />
Come 4.2, raiders doing Firelands and Boss #2 of BH will get VP again. All 4.0 Raid content = JP, not VP. Heroics will still pay out their current system. So, while ppl who can't muster up the muscle to hit Firelands can get 980 VP a week (1050 if they can manage the new BH boss), the people who CAN raid, will get their 1250 cap, AND all the shiny 372 epics from normal mode Firelands. You will out-pace and out-gear the Heroic farming ppl in no time.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way: It means that people you look to recruit won't be AS far behind, should the need arise.<br />
<br />
So again: If you are already doing Heroic Modes in 4.0, this change is of ZERO impact to you, aside from gearing your alts faster most likely. If what OTHER people get from doing something of less work bugs you, go play a solo game. Cause you sound like all the ppl who bitched cause Blizzard made Dual Spec level 30 and cost 10g, vs level 40 and costing 1000g during WotLK. Or the mount price changes...<br />
<br />
It's a GAME. Does it ruin YOUR fun when someone else gets to enjoy the game a little more with NO impact to your own gameplay?</div></div><hr />

I think most people will end up doing the troll dungeons just because you will be getting lots of upgrades at least the first few weeks. You will also get another 70 above this cap from BH, which is basically faceroll easy already.</div></div><hr />

Is the only reason you raid just to have better gear than someone? Isn't the raid gear better than point gear anyway? I don't keep up with this crap like I used to. The more you raid, the less you need points. All of wow is people worried about what everyone else is doing. The best gear should (and does, I believe) come from killing raid bosses. No one is getting better gear from grinding 5mans then you are getting from killing whatever the top boss is right now. Even IF they did....why do you care? If someone wants to grind 5-mans, let them have their fun. You don't play with them, so they aren't taking anything away from you. <br />
<br />
No one outside of our guilds care what gear we have. I get it now... the stats don't matter, as long as it's gear that others don't have. We gotta feel special. The gear grind is what hooks the most players, where as I enjoy the actual game and playing with people. The gear is a means to see more stuff and play more of the game. If they turned all gear that didn't drop from raid bosses back to green or blue, a lot less people would complain. God forbid someone did a boring 5-man instance grind to get a purple that you had to avoid standing in fire for a few minutes to get.</div></div><hr />

Seems like you can't read. Now you get 490 points if you do the daily each day. Next patch you'll be able to get 980 if you do the new heroics too, which give 140 each.</div></div><hr />

It won't slow you progression down. Casuals getting easy epic's won't fly by you on realm rankings either. What this can do is give casual players a chance to see the raid content, because let's face it, you aren't beating many bosses with ilvl 346.<br />
<br />
Embrace it, and be happy that you might actuelly get to take your alt to a raid also, because it will be easier to find people geared for it. Becides, if you want full epic gear you will still have to raid, because you can't buy every item with valot points, and the valor points earned from heroics will still only be able to provide 1 piece of gear every two weeks.</div></div><hr />

At level 60 do you know HOW a priest would get the &quot;Vestments of the Oracle&quot; set? Going through and getting the specific Scarabs and Idols while rolling against maybe 20 other people in AQ40 and then turning them in to get the gear. THAT was a challenge. THAT was a grind. It is more rewarding to get get if you really work at it. Blizz you disappoint me.<br />
<br />
You can easily remove the &quot;THAT was a challenge&quot; part.<br />
It was nothing more than just a boring grind and a time sink for the sake of time sink.<br />

That's like 7*70+2*70 = 630 VP in a single day... If Blizzard wants to please the crowd like this, they should please a epics for bananas vendor outside AH. Would be less time-consuming too.. I see a bad moon rising.<br />
<br />
You only forgot that one actually has to spend a good 4-6 hours (longer, if you include 30min+ dps queues) to actually get the VP. That's isn't exactly free, since time is the only resource you have invest in this game.</div></div><hr />

I totally agree with you. Warcraft + Anime = One massive no no. It ruins the epic feel of it for me and every Warcraft character drawn in that style just ends up looking stupid.

Excuse me, but am I totally missing something here? What in name of Spitfire and the Troubleshooters makes this a casual change? The VP cap, even after the patch, remains at 1250 per week. Every single person at level 85 can get these points, regardless of the 'virtual-caste' label you care to slap on them. What this new change brings is that you can get the majority of that cap (which again, is the same cap that is present now), in the first 7 heroics that you do in a week. Whether you do them all in one sitting, or still stretch them out over the week SHOULD be totally irrelevant. Because if you truly are trying to make the argument that people shouldn't have this option, which doesn't speed up VP gear acquisition at all, I would love to know why.<br />
<br />
Really, am I missing something? Does this say the cap is extended beyond the current 1250/week?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, but the torture of running 2-3 latest tier random heroics per week should not last longer than maybe 2-3 months into a major patch until you get all you need from VP. Ok, maybe hybrids have it a bit worse.<br />
<br />
Still a better model that Wrath, where you had to do raids both in 10 and 25 man plus a damn random hc every day if you wanted to maximize your performance.<br />

I can agree with that one. There really isn't much randomness from two instances. Like flipping a coin over and over again. But then again people do the same on-farm raid bosses over and over again as well.</div></div><hr />

What's the big fucking deal in letting those that had trouble or didn't have a whole lot of time get gear? Blizzard is a business, if they want to make as much profit as possible they need to cater to all their customers, if that means letting them slide through the cracks a bit, why should it matter? You all act like the only people this caters to is bad players, but there are folks who want to get in to raiding, but aren't able to get geared up in a timely fashion. <br />
<br />
But why should we let people see the content? They're a different type of player than me. They may pay the same subscription fee, but who cares, Blizzard should make content for me and me only. Self entitlement, it's rich here.</div></div><hr />

That's like 7*70+2*70 = 630 VP in a single day... If Blizzard wants to please the crowd like this, they should please a epics for bananas vendor outside AH. Would be less time-consuming too.. I see a bad moon rising.<br />

yea 630 in a single day per day until you hit the heroic VP cap of 980 a week. Dont mislead that you can do this per day indefinitely</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm thinking it's just for pacing out this last 2-3 months of the first tier so that people who didn't manage to raid much, or started late, or rerolled to an alt are up to speed when the next tier starts. Come 4.2 I expect the numbers will get juggled around again.</div></div><hr />

And this won't change, noone will become top #100 hardcore heroic raider because now they can get to the VP cap every week.

If you are truly raiding you won't need much Valor Points at all.

You wonÂ´t have to do that. Because of the valor cap, you will only have to do 3 or 4 troll dungeons per week, and the rest can be the other dungeons.<br />

Well you can get nearly full epic from it so :/<br />
<br />
It feels like /slap for the ones that were tring to aquire the gear not just farm HCs :/<br />
<br />
So you are really insulted because other people playing a game can get some of the same items you can get from playing a game. Items that donÂ´t even really exist. This is the type of thing that insults you??<br />
<br />
Blizzard is much smarter than you guys. The vast majority of their players do not raid extensively. If you turn off their Â´progressionÂ´because they donÂ´t raid, then you will lose a whole bunch of subscribers. The reason WOW has grown so much over the past 4 years is because there is Â´progressionÂ´available for everyone. Get over yourself.. even with this change, people doing only heroics will only be able to buy 1 piece of gear every two weeks.<br />
<br />
I laugh at all the hardcore raiders who act like they are tough because they raid, but then cry on the forums like 2 year olds because someone else might have the same toy they have.... that they Â´workedÂ´so hard for. My guild is first in progression on our server, and we are happy about this change because it allows us to gear up alts so that we have more flexibility. It also makes it so that we wonÂ´t have to do old content for weeks in order to gear up a new member. The practical implications of this system benefit raiders. The only people who are crying are the ones who raid so they feel Â´specialÂ´.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically, instead of having to do one heroic a day for valor points, you can do them all in one day. Or in two days, or over whatever period of time you want, as long as it's in the same week. So for example if you have a really busy day of work on Wednesday and don't have time to play WoW, you don't lose those 70 VP; you can just get them later in the week.<br />
<br />
The troll heroics will also give more VP for completing them because they are harder than the original Cata heroics. The maximum number of VP you can get from doing heroics is now 980 instead of 490.</div></div><hr />

Too bad the people you're telling to quit make up a good majority of the playerbase, so why should Blizzard, as a business, not make changes that would make the majority happy? You could call it selling out or whatever, but they're a business, and if a business isn't there to make money then they're doing it wrong.</div></div><hr />

I recommend taking a break from raiding and posting here to read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-on_sentence.<br />
<br />
I have been playing WoW for 6 years now. I used to raid all the time. I work 70-hour weeks because I like having lots of money IRL more than I like having lots of purples in WoW. There is no conceivable reason why I should feel compelled to play a new game simply because I &quot;don't have time for&quot; it (as in, I don't have as much time as you, the self-proclaimed model citizen of WoW). If you are unable to comprehend how these changes do not actually make epics any &quot;easier&quot; to obtain despite the fact that they do add a level of convenience for those of us with actual lives and schedules and obligations outside of a box of rasterized polygons, then there is no sense in carrying an argument any further. I would sooner argue with a bag of rocks or a jar of mayonnaise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are implenting theyre &quot;Hey look it will be hard for casuals to try Firelands, so we implent something that will give em free points and epics so they can try it NICE IS IT ?!&quot; thing that they were doing whole WOTLK and we know what it was like back then :X<br />
<br />
Yup... the perfect storm of ungemmed casuals poorly facerolling through heroics because of the arrogant elitist raiders doing their daily point-farming chores.<br />
<br />
As a gemmed casual non-raiding player who studies how to play the game and is quite good at it for all my lack of raiding, in Wrath I found the latter to be far, far, FAR more annoying than the former, who at least kept their mouths shut for the most part. A crappy DPS who wasn't carrying their weight meant for challenge (and therefore fun) for me in otherwise challengeless content; the stupid whiney raider constantly insulting and insisting everyone &quot;pull their weight&quot; when the fire mage could have AoE dps'd the whole thing solo behind the T12 overgeared tank killed my buzz more than anything.<br />
<br />
Here's a thought that's way, way out there:<br />
A corporation is going to make decisions that attempt to guarantee its continued success. If you feel like Blizzard is constantly changing the game deliberately in such a way it is making you consider leaving, they probably are.... if you want them to stop, then try not behaving in a manner which makes them think you are risking their profit.</div></div><hr />

You better don't talk as long you don't have the facts too. T12 is far away and you don't know how many T12 parts one get get for VP. You talk as if 5 parts are buyable....<br />
<br />
This QQ is getting on everybodys nerves already!<br />
<br />
You could get t9/t10/t11 without doing raids since about 2 years now.<br />
<br />
You get 3 pieces of T11 for VP, for the 4 piece bonus you still need to kill nefarian or cho'gall. That'll be just same with T12!<br />
<br />
Some of you elistists act as if you pay 50$ a month for exclusive content.<br />
<br />
Everyone pays the same monthly fee and everyone has the same rights to wear T11 or to buy stuff for VP.<br />
<br />
Be honest, is a casual gamer full 359 equiped if he buys all that's available for VP? No he isn't, you as raider &quot;can be&quot; are. So stop to act as if WoW is made only for you...</div></div><hr />

Now, I can't speak for the two worgens in the forest image, but my drawing (the one holding the stone), is crying due to a huge influx of memories. It's kind of an RP thing I had months ago, and it's explained slightly on my deviantART.

<br />
They won't be adding in any new currency as far as I'm aware of. They're sticking with JP (for old gear) and VP (newest gear)<br />
<br />
When T12 gear is put on the vendors, its going to work like this:<br />
<br />
Current T11 359 gear will shift down to JP, and all current VP will transfer over into JP, thus wiping out your current VP count.<br />
New T12 gear will cost VP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you. The Blue's language was a bit twisty.<br />
There is a weekly VP cap of 1250. This will not change.<br />
In 4.1, we will get a cap from VP gained from Heroics of 980 VP. We will have now two tiers of Heroics. We can earn a max of 490 VP from Tier 1 Heroics, which are the dungeons we have now. From the coming 4.1 Tier 2 dungeons, which will be ZA and ZG, we can earn a max 980 VP. So, we can earn our weekly VP cap from running only the Tier 2 Heroics. <br />
The Tier 2 Heroics will be on par of difficulty as the current raids, so if you aren't geared for or capable of running (read: not failing at) the opening raids of Cataclysm, you don't be able to make through ZA- and ZG-redux. <br />
<br />
What is also changing is that we can run seven random Tier 1 H's in a row, all in a single day, earning 70 VP for each completed. Tier 2 Heroics are on a separate cool-down, so to speak. This means we can run the seven Tier 1's, getting 490 VP and then run four Tier 2 Heroics to hit the cap. Or any similar permutations to hit the VP 980 Heroic cap.<br />
<br />
Why would someone not want to run only the Tier 2 H's? Because that sounds boring, Zoidberg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Running heroics each and every day and paying a mothly fee is not &quot;getting well deserved items&quot;? WTF! Do you expect casual games to just afk in stormwind, doing their 25 dailies and 1 rnd heroic a day and beside that they have to shut up, be nice and don't ask for epics? You sir are an elitist, how bout you running a private server, where everything belongs to you and noone else gets something?<br />
<br />
Your math skills aren't the best aren't they?<br />
<br />
You have to kill 7! bosses of which 2 are tier 2 heroic bosses. Not all casuals will and can complete ZG and ZA.<br />
7x70 = 490 if they do the regular heroics.<br />
Only the ZG and ZA bosses yield 140 VP per kill. Nonetheless you have to kill 7 bosses for &quot;casual cap of 490&quot; or 7 ZG/ZA bosses for 980 cap.<br />
<br />
A normal casual gamer who has an iLvl of 333 or maybe 337 or even 340, can't enter ZG/ZA since you ONLY can enter them via Dungeonfinder, and they'll need iLvl 346 for it.<br />
<br />
People that have 346 iLvl still don't complete ZA/ZG for 100%, if some of them still don't finish GB or DM.. do you really think they can finish the new ones?<br />
<br />
So summa summarum: A casual gamer most likey will still only get 490 VP + Baradinhold 70 VP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The new heroics give 140. Current ones will still give 70. If you do 7 of the new ones, which give a greater reward for a much greater challenge and gear level, you will hit the HEROIC CAP of 980, and be unable to earn any more. <br />
<br />
Why do you feel entitled to anything whatsoever, simply because you spend more hours sitting at home playing a video game? That is the only argument you are making, and we would all appreciate if you would stop spewing out elitist garbage. I hit my VP cap from just raiding, and I have absolutely no problem with people running heroics for VP, just like they do now.<br />
<br />
This a million times. <br />
<br />
They already have the gear, but heaven-be-damned if they're going to &quot;allow&quot; someone who can't play more than an hour a day have it without screaming &quot;gg blizz&quot;. <br />

Exclusionists want exclusive rights to the game. They don't want harder content, they just want to be the only ones to see it. Ever.<br />

Alright, I'll bite. <br />
Please provide a business model that will keep a casual player involved enough to pay $15 a month. If only the people that can play 4 hours a day and raid 3 nights a week, you run the risk of losing a huge portion of your paying customers. <br />
<br />
If you have everything done (and by the way you are defending your argument, it sounds as if you are a very accomplished raider) then why do you give two shats how fast the &quot;old&quot; gear comes for us that can't play but a little each week? Should t you be concerned with the higher ilvl stuff in the new, harder 5 mans coming out?<br />
<br />
Unless, of course my assesment of you is correct and you are, indeed, someone who wishes sole rights to everything wow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fundamentally, yes. There is a really big business model problem in seperating your playerbase. You cannot honestly expect someone who pays the same as everyone else to be severly restricted in their ability to see all of the content. One cannot expect that fishing, cooking, and jewelcrafting dailies will be enough to keep customers coming back for more. <br />
<br />
As a casual, I have sucked up the fact that I don't get to see everything as fast as a dedicated player. It's fine. It's the nature of the beast. I'm 80% okay with it (I still would rather pay less, but that argument is not this thread). This does not mean I am a bad player. It means I work, have a wife, have housework, have a gym membership, have real life flesh friends, have other games to play. And I'm okay with it, I am. I get to see the stuff about 3 months slower, and pay just the same. I deal. <br />
<br />
What I cannot deal with is the pompus additude of exclusionists that think just because they can be celler dwellers and devote &gt;20 hours a week playing a GAME that blizzard should shovel the shit out of their way so the all mighty Minmax can come through and bust some shit up. <br />

If your in a position where you still need valor point gear and are QQing others will get it easier, you are also casual so probably no point in giving others a hard time about it.<br />
<br />
If your in a position where your decked in 359 and dont need anything from valor point and your QQing that so called &quot;casuals&quot; can gear up to the same standard as you, stop being bad and start killing HC bosses already, it's not their fault your bad.<br />
<br />
On the brightside, my alts are happy and my mains happy because its easier to cap out and get valor boots quicker even when &quot;progressing&quot;:see wiping, on a new HC boss which is earlier in the instance so not clearing 12/12 that week.</div></div><hr />

If I had to say something about this that affects me personally it's the fact that if I want to get the weekly Valor Point cap I have to run heroics, since clearing the full raiding content itself doesn't provide me with the amount of points needed. At this point of the raiding tier it doesn't matter, but at the beginning it does. This new system of turning heroics from daily to weekly is pleasing, but I'd rather not touch them at all. Getting 980/1250 Valor Points from heroics a week also means that in the next tier Valor Point gear is handed to casuals and raiders at a similiar rate in the beginning, which cannot be right no matter how you look at it, not that it affects me in the least though.</div></div><hr />

I though to myself who cares what Ja rule thinks about that and thats pretty much how i feel now. Your entitled to your opinion but if it's just that you don't need to champion it above all else. <br />
And as for next tier they never said they'd keep valor points from HCs the same as now or raid valor the same, i'm aware that without further info we shouldnt assume they'll give you less valor in 4.2 but it's blizzard you can't assume they wont either. So QQ about that if/when it comes, now is always more important on this game.</div></div><hr />

If you are a raider what you should be careing about is the ability of your raid team to become a cohesive group of players working together to overcome obsticales and as a result kill challenging and exciting encounters. That is what raiding is all about, to me at least. Of course gear matters, because we all want to see our charecter evolve, but the fact that &quot;casuals&quot; can get epics without actuelly raiding don't take anything away from &quot;raiders&quot;. In order to get full epic gear of current tier, you still need to kill raid bosses. In order to get maximum gear 4-set bonuses you still need to kill end-bosses.<br />
So to all those cry-babies out there, start playing the game for the right reasons.<br />
<br />
EDIT: <br />
Also, I agree with #139. Clearing all bosses in current raid tier should give enough valor points to meet the weekly cap. I can accept that in the first weeks of a new tier where you aren't killing all the bosses and are still working on normal progression, a few random heroics to meet the cap is needed. Once you are clearing everything on normal, the random heroic farming shouldn't be a neccesity however.</div></div><hr />

I think the current requirement for heroics is 329, will someone be able to queue for the new heroics at that level, if so then that will be a problem. Nothing like having someone doing subpar DPS in a higher heroic, almost as bad as not pulling 10K at least on BH. I find myself saying the same thing to people in my guild, to many people are trying to leap frog the progression system. I have a few heroic pieces that are not BiS pre raid (I know some classes have BiS from heroics) yeah I think I am ready for raids. NO NO NO. You need to keep doing your heroics, farm some more rep and buy some valor pieces before you try and tackle harder raids. <br />
<br />
I am happy about the change in heroic daily to heroic weekly because everyday I don't have to race home from work sit in queue while I cook dinner and hope that the tank doesn't leave, leaving me stuck in queue again. I can relax on a Saturday or Sunday put on a NBA, NFL, college football game and just wait for the heroics to start.

This change is horrible. 80% of your VP points just by doing heroics? lol? This is a joke right?<br />
<br />
I don't even raid anymore, and even I say that non-raiders such as myself definitely DO NOT deserve the amount of points (80%) a raider who puts the time in does.<br />

Really? How many slots are filled through VP items? <br />
You can get a trinket, if it is BiS for your role, but that's really not a thing for everyone, with trinkets what they are. A cloak and a ring. BoE boots. Relics, if you use relics. And three Tier 11 pieces (legs, chest, hands). Missing from the VP vendor list are things in the weapon, waist, head, neck, wrist, ranged (bow, gun, wand), shield, and off-hand slot. Also that fourth Tier 11 piece, or something similar.<br />
<br />
It's a shame that there aren't places for players to get the best things. It shouldn't be just handed out, of course. That wouldn't be right. Or be predictable either, as there wouldn't be a reason for a player to do something more than once. Or easy, as a question of skill has to be the gateway for getting a chance to get the things they would need. <br />
This is something Blizzard should work on.</div></div><hr />
