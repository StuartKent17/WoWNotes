Cataclysm Post Mortem - Dungeons and Raids with Scott “Daelo” Mercer	<br />
As a part of our post mortem series on Cataclysm, we sat down with World of Warcraft Lead Encounter Designer Scott “Daelo” Mercer to hear his thoughts on Cataclysm dungeons and raids.<br />
<br />
Q. What were your main goals going into Cataclysm?<br />
We really wanted to make sure we were creating new challenges, strong mechanics, and cool creatures while staying true to the expansion and the themes we wanted to carry out. The three raid dungeons came out well and we had a lot of fun bringing the story of Nefarian and the Twilight’s Hammer to life. We were also able to add some dynamic mechanics in Throne of the Four Winds (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/throne-of-the-four-winds/), which featured players moving across multiple platforms.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/thumb/6E3VY6RW4BFW1329941619673.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/6E3VY6RW4BFW1329941619673.jpg) <br />
<br />
Q. How did this evolve over the various content patches?<br />
Zul’Gurub (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/zulgurub/) and Zul’Aman (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/zulaman/) were entertaining raids with diverse mechanics, and they translated well when we converted them into Heroic dungeons for patch 4.1. Interesting mechanics and features that once were restricted to raids are now finding their way into our five-player dungeons.<br />
<br />
Adding the Dungeon Journal (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2943357) in patch 4.2 was also a major step forward. We wanted to be able to share more information in the game so that players wouldn’t feel the need to go look everything up on external websites. While those sites are great at what they do, we felt like we needed to try to alleviate the need to go out of the game to find the information players wanted to see.<br />
<br />
The addition of Raid Finder (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/4023602) in patch 4.3 also opened up more opportunities for players to be able to experience our raid content. The feature has proven to be extremely popular, and not just with people who had given up on raiding. Many players use Raid Finder to gear up their secondary characters, gain Valor for the week, or just because it’s fun.<br />
<br />
Q. What do you think worked best?<br />
We’ve been reasonably successful with our tuning across all four raid difficulty modes. There were a few warts here and there, but we delivered on the idea that 10-player and 25-player raids could exist at a similar difficulty. We also had some memorable dungeons and cinematic moments in Cataclysm. I’m particularly fond of the interactive bombing run in Grim Batol (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/grim-batol/) involving the red drakes. Players really got a sense of the epic scale of Grim Batol, and how well they performed in the event could make clearing the rest of the dungeon much easier.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/thumb/OUCVDZM6BOFL1329941822013.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/OUCVDZM6BOFL1329941822013.jpg) <br />
<br />
With our improved tools and the experience we’ve gained over the years, we’ve become better at finding ways to explain the mechanics of our encounters. Our bosses do a better job of warning players of incoming threats. In Dragon Soul (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/dragon-soul/) we also began to better inform players of mechanics that caused them to die. Providing a better understanding of the encounters to players is an important goal. We feel that losing to a boss and not understanding why is frustrating, just as beating a boss and not understanding why you won is not as satisfying.<br />
<br />
Q. What didn’t work out as planned or expected?<br />
Initially, we started off the Heroic dungeons at too high of a difficulty. The difficulty level rather abruptly changed when compared to the Heroics players experienced at the end of Wrath of the Lich King. This major change caught many players off guard, and frustrated some of them. The difficulty also increased the effective amount of time required to complete a dungeon to a longer experience than we wanted. With the release of patch 4.3 we’re now in a much better place. We’ve always talked about being able to complete a dungeon over lunch, and the Hour of Twilight dungeons get us back to that goal. End Time (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/end-time/), Well of Eternity (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/well-of-eternity/), and Hour of Twilight (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/hour-of-twilight/) all provide epic play experiences to our players, but at the real sweet spot of difficulty, complexity, and time commitment.<br />
<br />
Q. Was there anything that surprised you about how players reacted to a particular encounter?<br />
Not particularly. Something we’ve learned over the years is to expect the unexpected. The community is very creative and intelligent. The most important thing for us is that players are having fun. They often find interesting ways of approaching things that maybe we didn’t expect, but as long the creative solution is still fun for everyone, we usually don’t have a problem with it.<br />
<br />
Q. What have you learned from Cataclysm and what are some of your top goals for Mists of Pandaria?<br />
We learned we could create a crazy encounter like the Spine of Deathwing (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/dragon-soul/spine-of-deathwing). It took a lot of hard work from the whole team and it was a difficult design challenge to tackle. How do you orchestrate a fight on the back of a gigantic flying dragon without inducing nausea? How do we make sure you feel like you’re on Deathwing? Delivering that experience was really important and everyone wanted the opportunity to work on it. What was really great was that we launched the story of Cataclysm with the cinematic (http://youtu.be/Wq4Y7ztznKc) that showed Deathwing having his elementium plates being put on, then we end the expansion with those very same plates being torn off. It gives some real closure to storyline.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
For Mists of Pandaria (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/mists-of-pandaria/), we will continue to provide new dungeons and raids while also presenting interesting new types of content in the form of challenge modes and scenarios. Players will also be introduced to new enemies in the Sha, Mogu, and Mantids. Making those creatures come to life will be a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
Q. Do you have a favorite dungeon or encounter from Cataclysm?<br />
There are so many. The Conclave of Wind was a great one. Working out interesting mechanics that allowed players to go from platform to platform was a lot of fun and the environment felt really epic. A fight like that was a goal of the encounter team for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Blackwing Descent (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/blackwing-descent/) was another favorite and working out the mechanics for the Atramedes (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/blackwing-descent/atramedes) fight gave us a lot to think about. How do you create an encounter with a blind dragon that fights? So we gave him sonar and showed the interaction with a sound meter on the player’s UI.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/thumb/UMTY2JT5N1RL1329941684567.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/UMTY2JT5N1RL1329941684567.jpg) <br />
<br />
In Bastion of Twilight (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/the-bastion-of-twilight/), we really got to sell the corruption angle on Cho’gall (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/the-bastion-of-twilight/chogall) which made for another really interesting fight.<br />
<br />
Q. Is there a certain mechanic that you always wanted to do but couldn’t do prior to Cataclysm? <br />
Not really. There are so many cool ideas to work with that I never feel held back. It’s easy to be creatively inspired by the people around you and their energy. It’s never a problem of coming up with ideas. It’s usually deciding which ones we want to go with next, but the possibilities are endless.<br />
<br />
Q. Do you have a “dream” dungeon or encounter that you’d like to create if you had the opportunity?<br />
I’ve never felt that I haven’t been able to do the things I want to do. Everyone on the team is completely dedicated to giving us unlimited opportunities to make epic and awesome experiences. But, if I have to mention something, it would be huge giant death robots. We had Mimiron (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/ulduar/mimiron#npc=mimiron) in Ulduar, but you just can’t have too many death robots.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time, Scott.<br />
You’re welcome.<br />

Darkmoon Faire Issues<br />
February’s Darkmoon Faire achievement progress status was cleared prior to the launch of March's faire. Any achievements that were started but not completed have had their criteria reset. Completed achievements are unaffected. We previously announced that this was resolved for this month and going forward, unfortunately, that did not happen and this is still being investigated for a resolution.<br />
<br />
The following achievements are most likely impacted:<br />
<br />
Darkmoon Defender (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/6028/darkmoon-defender/)<br />
Darkmoon Dungeoneer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/6027/darkmoon-dungeoneer/)<br />
Darkmoon Despoiler (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/6029/darkmoon-despoiler/)<br />
<br />
Regrettably, we are not able to restore any progress you may have made during February's faire. We understand the impact this may have had and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.<br />

I don't expect anyone at Blizzard to come out and detail specific arguments about content difficulty, or encounter design, or raid size scaling issues, but I would have preferred it to at least sound like the sort of thing that a real human would say if you were talking with them face to face. <br />

Well, that`s an opinion too..but could you explain to me which instaces were the last ones where you spent &quot;hours&quot; (WoE with the buff is really a joke...not to mention the endboss fight which is basically a fight between 3 npc...but hell, if you like that, have fun:))</div></div><hr />

But I really enjoyed the challenge they provided the first couple of weeks in cata, while gearing for raids. I know I fall in the minority, which is sad, but I hope, going into Mist of Pandaria, that at least raids won't be dumbed down to the current level. Thats just my two cents though :-)</div></div><hr />

Worse. interview. ever .... <br />
Scott “Daelo” Mercer is so tasteless, i get it now. if someone like him is in charge it could explain a few things... I don't get it... he seems to have ab-so-lu-te-ly no point of view whatsoever about how things went thoughout cata it's impressive. <br />
<br />
I mean the interviewer asks him a few interesting questions like - were you surprised by anything ? what did u think worked best ? what didnt work out as intended ? what have you learned ? and so on ...<br />
.....AND HIS ANSWERS ARE ALL THE SAME : - Hmm i don't know maybe, i guess. <br />
<br />
wait. . .what ? That's all that's comming to mind ? there's SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT and you have NOTHING TO SAY.... REALLY. <br />
I'm really amazed by his lack of interest in the game.</div></div><hr />

I think the fact we were able to drive away many hardcore raiding guilds within a few months of release and also eliminate approximately 2.5 million other accounts proved to work exactly as planned. Since these were mostly players that took the game too seriously and made it difficult for us, no big deal. For MoP we intend to drive away at least 50%, if not more, within the first two months. Eventually you will be mailed current tier items with each patch, something we never could have gotten away with as long as &quot;those people&quot; were around. <br />
<br />
I keep saying this. The problem with the developers at this very moment is that they are casual gamers, not actual raiders or PvPers, if they even play the game at all. The old guard were serious gamers. Tigole and Furor ... holy crap. These were people that fed on the tears of the general public. They had to throttle their own guild back just to allow others to get world first kills. Game's too hard? HA! Go farm 250,000 Stranglekelp. Don't have your attunements? Tough. Compare these two legends to where we are today. Mercer was allowed the encounter lead in Wrath, so I ask you... how's that working out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always took that as the price for having better gear. A matter of &quot;You want to progress in the game? put in some extra time and effort.&quot; Even then, I rarely had any terrible experiences in Heroic cataclysm dungeons. Ever. <br />
<br />
I don't really find the three new heroics ANY kind of fun. At all. I actually had a better time of it running ZA/ZG for months. End time is the only one of the new dungeons I can tolerate, as it's the only one that actually requires anything requiring effort to complete. Well of Eternity would have been better if it weren't so repetitive, and Hour of Twilight... I see very few saving graces about it. At all. If I wanted to run around Dragonblight, I would. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, if Blizzard feels heroics need to be &quot;easier,&quot; they should make end level normal dungeons that are of that &quot;easier&quot; difficulty, and maintain heroics as being more difficult. I honestly don't see anything wrong with this model. Heroics taking too long or are too challenging? Continue gearing up in normal dungeons until you're good enough. The &quot;entry barrier&quot; present in raiding is a non-issue for normal to heroic dungeons, as you don't need a &quot;heroic dungeon guild&quot; to do heroics. You get a nice queue mechanic that sticks you right in a group. And like I said, if someone wants the better gear, they need to stick it out. It's more a question of commitment than skill as it is. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for raids in general, a lot of their effort seems to go into designing actual boss mechanics, which is fine... it just seems that raid &quot;depth&quot; tends to suffer in turn...</div></div><hr />

It's a shark tank of pack hunting sharks swipping food from solo sharks.The reaction to spine of deathwing has been so overwhelmingly negative, I honestly thought that Daelo here was trolling. From a technical , the fight is an interesting concept. From an execution standpoint, it's a mess. Entire classes rendedered useless by mechanics. Fighting mobs, not deathwing himself. Closure? Closure fighting what... tentacles, elementals and slimes? This quote is as delusional Corey Stockton's love letter to WoW's outdated quest design last week. Grim Batol is epic?

This is the No BS comment so far. Loved Rift, renewing that account. The thing I loved most about Rift was the failure penalty - this is unfortunately why it's not as popular however. You run the wrong way in a raid and you get 2 shot. It's a know wtf to do or get clobbered thing. Hey! Like Classic! Although PvP in that game is pretty fair. A level 50 beating up on lowbies can get hammered if enough lowbies get together.

<br />
I note that T11 raids was noted as favorites and well as far as this expansion goes they are mine as well. Sadly though I thought there was room for improvement in overall zone designs and yet things went downhill. <br />
<br />
To me making that shift from a year of face roll two year old dungeons being tanked by dps and ignoring fight mechanics to requiring CC and punishing players for ignoring fight mechanics was definitely a shock for players and even more so when the RDF system is involved. What I find issue with is how they feel the current dungeons are at the right level, especially for the last set of dungeons of an expansion, couldnt they at least be as difficult as the ICC five mans?<br />
<br />
Oh and to those who say &quot;casuals&quot; couldnt raid during t11 because it wasnt too hard, I call BS. I PuGed T11 raids pre nerf and PuGs got as far as 9/12 to 10/12 dependant on gear, skill and willingness of players to bother to work together as a team. &quot;Casual&quot; does not mean selfish player who expects team mates to carry them. It took almost a year for PuGs on my realm to get that far in ICC and that was with a nerf. In my years of PuGing the biggest reason I have seen PuGs stop short is because of the selfish players who are looking for a carry and have no intentions of puling their weight.</div></div><hr />

Look back at the other end of expac raids, I mean, I know we did ICC for like a year and a bit but it was epically big with new models set in an environment that had been overaching the whole story line with a serious villain. <br />
<br />
T11 was boss, so much variety allowed by the three different raids designed perfectly around the typical guild which will raid 3 days a week. They said that raiders were finding this too much (semi hardcore here, never saw anyone complaining about that) and they cut it down to 7 in FL. TBF we did skip 4 winds and al'akir most weeks, but the options and variety was awesome.<br />
<br />
FL was unique and interesting, confusing as hell the first time you set foot in it and nice new models. Fights like Alyz and Ryho were truly inspired. Downside was the staff collection rate of 10vs25 but overall a good tier.<br />
<br />
THEN we have DS, imo 5 awesome fights (not ultrax spine or madness) (this is heroic) including one of my favs warmaster, the variety of strategy the bredth of the encounters allowed (in these 5) were truly great. HOWEVER Ultrax was literally intended to be a brick wall to heroic guilds racing for world first lacking any truly interesting mechanics for a dragon which was supposed to be better than Nefarion (WTF?!?!?!111?). Spine, how the hell can this guy say how proud he was of it when it induced such a harsh class stacking mechanic and noone even saw the f*cking boss unless the died?! The fight is terrible, the most interesting thing that happens is you get 10000 bloods and your tank has to kite them around *clap* *clap* sure it takes execution but really its whoever has the most legendary arcane mages whos going to get the kill. Madness is such a huge anti-climax, kill a claw kill a tentacle woop woop you beat the game. Oh wait dont forget the big head you have to beat on at the end of the fight, but then again those adds are posing more of a threat better kill them first....<br />
<br />
Truly tragic he cant admit that he wouldve prefered another content patch and a more epic climax to the expansion. The guy designed ulduar, ICC, BWD, BoT and FL he thinks that Spine is the best thing to come out of cata? That 5 minute heroics where 1 geared dps can carry a group are a good thing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amen. It is sad watching Blizz prove they are so out of touch with players and clearly completely lacking in understanding why they are losing subscriptions,<br />
<br />
The 4.3 dugneons were great dungeons in terms of design, story and mechanics, but the fact that they provided ZERO challenge made them boring and made players like myself, who isn't in any way hardcore, lose interest very very fast. Compare them to ICC 5-mans, which provided challenges and playable content for months and months, these were just money down the drain for Blizzard. <br />
<br />
The problem is the whole &quot;tourist mode&quot; attitude of Blizz to raids and dungeons alike. If you can do it in tourist mode, you get done with it a few weeks after patch day. Then what? Well for me, I've just unsubscribed. I'll come back for MoP, sure, but it will be the same again after completing MoP content 1-2 months after launch. Their business modell really isn't great for people being subscribers for a total of 4 months every 2 years.</div></div><hr />

Rift currently does have the best PVE endgame content. I have always said if Trion had brought out a popular RTS, RPG like blizzard did before creating a MMO they would have a much larger sub base which they deserve.<br />

That's how fucking awful Blizzard's developers are when someone completely outside the game could fix it better than they can.<br />
<br />
The problem? It's so fucking obvious. They made the criteria for the achievement QUESTS that they then RESET every month. DUH FUCKING DUH. Because they couldn't find a non-fail way to limit the Darkmoon turn ins rather than let people just farm them and get &quot;too many&quot; previous tickets at once.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2012-03-06, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q. What were your main goals going into Cataclysm?<br />
We really wanted to make sure we were creating new challenges, strong mechanics, and cool creatures while staying true to the expansion and the themes we wanted to carry out. The three raid dungeons came out well and we had a lot of fun bringing the story of Nefarian and the Twilight’s Hammer to life. We were also able to add some dynamic mechanics in Throne of the Four Winds (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/throne-of-the-four-winds/), which featured players moving across multiple platforms.<br />
The Omnotron Defense System and Atramedes bosses were fun, but that was it. People in general were teed off about facing Nefarian and Onyxia yet again. Old is old, Blizzard. Also, while TotFW was a beautiful raid zone... its loot wasn't worth the trouble beyond having another chance at a tier token, and only if you were having some seriously bad RNG. For the most part, the drops were disenchanted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. How did this evolve over the various content patches?<br />
Zul’Gurub (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/zulgurub/) and Zul’Aman (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/zulaman/) were entertaining raids with diverse mechanics, and they translated well when we converted them into Heroic dungeons for patch 4.1. Interesting mechanics and features that once were restricted to raids are now finding their way into our five-player dungeons.<br />
Heck no! I think I can speak for many players when I say &quot;NEVER AGAIN!&quot; I hate those places with a passion, and am still mad what Blizzard has done to the Zandalar tribe. (And they removed content for this tripe.) :mad:<br />
<br />
<br />
Adding the Dungeon Journal (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2943357) in patch 4.2 was also a major step forward. We wanted to be able to share more information in the game so that players wouldn’t feel the need to go look everything up on external websites. While those sites are great at what they do, we felt like we needed to try to alleviate the need to go out of the game to find the information players wanted to see.<br />
This I don't mind. It still needs some work, but it's great to refer to for boss(es) abilities.<br />
<br />
The addition of Raid Finder (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/4023602) in patch 4.3 also opened up more opportunities for players to be able to experience our raid content. The feature has proven to be extremely popular, and not just with people who had given up on raiding. Many players use Raid Finder to gear up their secondary characters, gain Valor for the week, or just because it’s fun.<br />
Raid Finder is great for alts. Mains, not so much.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. What do you think worked best?<br />
We’ve been reasonably successful with our tuning across all four raid difficulty modes. There were a few warts here and there, but we delivered on the idea that 10-player and 25-player raids could exist at a similar difficulty. We also had some memorable dungeons and cinematic moments in Cataclysm. I’m particularly fond of the interactive bombing run in Grim Batol (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/grim-batol/) involving the red drakes. Players really got a sense of the epic scale of Grim Batol, and how well they performed in the event could make clearing the rest of the dungeon much easier.<br />
So the death of many 25 guilds due to the equalizing of loot item level doesn't even appear on your radar? Ok. And Grim Batol... ooh, that name greatly increases my blood pressure. http://static.diablofans.com/public/style_emoticons/default/boom.gif<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. What didn’t work out as planned or expected?<br />
Initially, we started off the Heroic dungeons at too high of a difficulty. The difficulty level rather abruptly changed when compared to the Heroics players experienced at the end of Wrath of the Lich King. This major change caught many players off guard, and frustrated some of them. The difficulty also increased the effective amount of time required to complete a dungeon to a longer experience than we wanted. With the release of patch 4.3 we’re now in a much better place. We’ve always talked about being able to complete a dungeon over lunch, and the Hour of Twilight dungeons get us back to that goal. End Time (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/end-time/), Well of Eternity (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/well-of-eternity/), and Hour of Twilight (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/hour-of-twilight/) all provide epic play experiences to our players, but at the real sweet spot of difficulty, complexity, and time commitment.<br />
I would give kudos to Blizzard for belatedly recognizing that the starting tier of dungeons was over-tuned, but I can't do that in good conscience. They were told before-hand about the problem, and still ignored feedback even as they were ruining developing the troll heroics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. What have you learned from Cataclysm and what are some of your top goals for Mists of Pandaria?<br />
We learned we could create a crazy encounter like the Spine of Deathwing (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/dragon-soul/spine-of-deathwing). It took a lot of hard work from the whole team and it was a difficult design challenge to tackle. How do you orchestrate a fight on the back of a gigantic flying dragon without inducing nausea? How do we make sure you feel like you’re on Deathwing? Delivering that experience was really important and everyone wanted the opportunity to work on it. What was really great was that we launched the story of Cataclysm with the cinematic (http://youtu.be/Wq4Y7ztznKc) that showed Deathwing having his elementium plates being put on, then we end the expansion with those very same plates being torn off. It gives some real closure to storyline.<br />
Deathwing. The great villain that never was.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. Do you have a “dream” dungeon or encounter that you’d like to create if you had the opportunity?<br />
I’ve never felt that I haven’t been able to do the things I want to do. Everyone on the team is completely dedicated to giving us unlimited opportunities to make epic and awesome experiences. But, if I have to mention something, it would be huge giant death robots. We had Mimiron (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/zone/ulduar/mimiron#npc=mimiron) in Ulduar, but you just can’t have too many death robots.<br />
My dream is being able to over-gear dungeon mechanics that are current to the expansion. Basically, I want back the days of running around inside instances in my ICC gear and just trampling everything. RIP AoE damage. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most people playing today never saw Molten Core in it's prime or at level. While it was very, very, very simple in it's raid mechanics (tank, spank, decurse, heal, stay out of fire baddies, feral druid innervate me) it was hardly terrible. TOC has it beat by a mile for bad. The reason most hate it as well was the sheer fact you had to farm resistance to be able to also complete the place and were rewarded with T2 quality items and level 48 blues for your efforts. Rag's entrance was also considered by many the most epic of all boss entrances in the game for years.<br />
<br />
You just had to see the original BWL, AQ40, and Naxx at the level as they were developed and for the classes available at that time. Since the player population has turned over 3 times in 7 years (Source: Ghostcrawler) it's really difficult to get a solid internet opinion. This is one huge reason why I think MoP should include Legacy servers - just to give everyone a shot at playing the way they really want to play. I'd actually pay money for an expansion if it gave me the option to play the game in 5 different versions rather than the crap we're fed today. Pandas... no. Regrind the entire AQ event? Yes please.<br />
Pokemon... no. A true GM/HW grind again? Omg yes please. Take me to Illidan with all the gating and toppings, please. One day, maybe not anytime soon but someday. I've waited almost 12 years for D3, so I'm one patient no-lifer.</div></div><hr />

I mean the idea was good but it turned out to be fail. Do players enjoy Madness? No. If your idea of fun is doing more or less same thing 4 times to get to final phase to kill head of the dragon, head. Seriously there was no new content, its like Crtl+c -&gt; Ctrl+v and what is with the tentacles? They are everywhere, its sick. But from the start: T11 hc dungeons were indeed too hard. I mean if u went with friends that have a clue it was ok but if u went alone, after work to get your vp points you sometimes spend 2 hrs with noobs. Endless &quot;cc that, cc this, do that, do this&quot;. BTW the idea that u have whole week to cap ur vp was very good. They should did it faster. T11 raid were cool but there are some flaws for me. First of all they were unfinished (Sinestra for example), they were buggy and had many shits like grounding totems on Twin Drakes, the ice shit on Council, Magmaw adds kiting, Atramedes bug and some more. I know there will be always bugs but there were just too many. Also what with this &quot;extraplayerbar&quot; shit. They can't just add this as a debuff with &quot;sound level&quot; or &quot;corrupted blood level&quot; like on yog? Instead they add some new bar and think ppl will go like &quot;oh, this is new&quot;. In DS they added some new button to press. I mean rly, after MoP we will have like 10 new buttons to click 20 new bars to watch and maybe something else. Throne of the 4winds was good. Al'akir fight was fun, but i know its like u want to eat your own face fight on the beginning :D. Troll dungeons = Crtl+c -&gt; Ctrl+v. Zul'gurub was nice mechanic wise, nice bosses, almost no trash, coll stuff with claudrons but Zul'aman was like omfg. Tons of trash, long dungeon i mean instant leave. T12 was nice raid. It was small, cool bosses, some cool mechanics, and the most important good final boss. T13 its joke. I think I dont even have to comment on this. LFR is joke. The idea to get every1 to see everything is stupid. First of all if Blizzard says that only like 5% of wow players go raid why do you even care? Leave those 5% alone and do something for rest/or everyone. Now its like u have to go for LFR, and then to go normals to get your gear. Its like 10 and 25 again. Hello? Not to mention final boss. When i heard the Deathwing will be 2-boss encounter i thought &quot;man, that needs to be cool&quot; but then this bloods/tentacles and shit. I mean rly Blizzard. You have misstake in your cinematic, insteand of big dragon flying around and destroying azeroth put there big tentacle flying around, add some bloods as a tail and there you go. Final boss.</div></div><hr />

I actually think a lot of the good players have moved onto rift, the community in that game is very similar to what I experienced in burning crusade. It's great!</div></div><hr />

While I could praise the unique boss mechanics for new Zul'Gurub, it was vastly overturned -- the gear didn't justify the time investment to clear either of the overhauled Zandalari dungeons in a reasonable amount of time for most players who the dungeon's gear rewards were aimed at.<br />
<br />
I mean, if you've routinely experienced LFG groups where a tank is votekicked if they're not vastly outgearing the dungeon, that is indicative of a huge balance problem. Considering that there are going to be challenge mode dungeons in Mists of Pandaria based off of the Mount speed runs for Zul'Aman, this is something that Blizzard desperately needs to be careful of. <br />
<br />
Risk vs. reward levels for different levels of gameplay, and attempting to shove an apple (an instance where blue-geared players earn mediocre epics without the group dissolving due to a long dungeon/difficult trash mobs) and an orange (instance where well-geared players race to a bonus loot chests) into the exact same instance should not be something to be repeated.</div></div><hr />

Speaking of which, I did really like the dungeons at launch. I thought they were hard, but not too hard. The rewards seemed commiserate with the effort put in.The three new heroics DO NOT strike the right balance. WoE and HoT would be 20 minute dungeons, if large parts of them weren't scripted, max. ET can be as short as 10 minutes if you get the right mini-bosses (Sylvanas and Cairne? GG, 10 minute instance). People get ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY VP for completing these, which is 1/7th of the points needed to reach your weekly cap. Technically, you can cap your weekly points with 6 heroics and one BH &quot;raid&quot; boss for 100 VP, which is even shorter (2 trash mobs and then a boss who just might as well fall over dead when you engage her). I've never been in a new heroic which lasted more than 30 minutes - that means I can cap my weekly points in 3 hours a week, plus BH. I know heroics should be for casuals...but 3 hours a week? I spend more time showering in a week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's some issues here I would have liked Daelo to have addressed, most notably:<br />
<br />
-Abyssal Maw being scrapped<br />
<br />
-How they feel the separate 10 and 25 man raiding formats have worked out in Cataclysm. It was a huge change, and a comment would have been nice. If they feel it's not working out, it might be a precursor to the fact we might be seeing a single 15-man raiding format in Mists.<br />
<br />
-From the feedback they gauged, what mechanics and fights they felt players liked and which ones they didn't. Spine wasn't a popular fight, but it seems there's a disconnect here because it was widely unpopular with the community.<br />
<br />
That's my two cents. Daelos a great guy and I've talked with him on the PTR before a lot, but I really think this interview could have been more informative than it was. :(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eschatological</div><div class="date">2012-03-06, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking of which, Deadmines had a mob which had a buff which was immune to CC and raped tanks - but could be easily dealt with if you PURGED the buff and then CCed them. This one mob (3 iterations therein) has caused me more wipes in Cataclysm than some of the heroic bosses in DS. They say they want to introduce CC and interrupts and things into dungeons, but that's become progressively less true. Take one example: Hour of Twilight. Sure, you can interrupt the ice thing on the first boss in HoT so he does less damage, but it's inconsequential. Sure, you could break Thrall out of his tomb to ease up on the ice patches thrown down, but the ice patches do little damage AND THRALL BREAKS OUT AUTOMATICALLY AT 30%!?!1one! And then he BLOODLUSTS FOR YOU just in case you were in danger of getting overwhelmed by the massive AOE he was doing (hint, you weren't). Sure, the 2nd boss invokes a silence which ranged have to LoS the boss with melee/tanks/hunters. But the damage associated with the silence, the damage the boss does otherwise, and the fact that Thrall's throwing a massive thing that buffs you constantly makes the fight literally able to be done with 1 DPS, 1 tank, and 0 heals. Which I've done. The third boss is similarly a joke. Every mechanic is countered by Thrall in light phase, where you're supposed to &quot;learn what's up&quot;. He even dispels the dispellable debuff for you. The giant wave which rolls across the platform (which screams &quot;I am going to kill you!!!) does not, in fact, kill you. If you're unlucky, it'll take you to 50% health. Then shadow phase you have the exact same thing again except you have to dodge the pools on the ground, dispel the debuff, and avoid the wave, oh, but hey, we BLed light phase, and that bubble you can hide in on light phase gives a damage boost, so we only spend the last 15 seconds of the fight in shadow phase. Literally the RP leading up to the fight is often longer than the fight itself.</div></div><hr />

Some of the dungeons were good. Some of them were not. No mention of Firelands and no mention of the severe lack of content between 4.0 and 4.2 are the most troubling. And to make it sound like they met all of their design goals? Umm...that doesn't really seem to be the case when there's so much content announced then cancelled (Vashj'ir raid) or scaled back to a heroic (Well of Eternity raid).<br />
<br />
I know I'm preaching to the choir here. What I hope is that there is a lot more internal honesty within Blizzard because it sure seems like they're playing softball to the presses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the last time you had a community problem you had to nerf the instance by 30% and release an accessibility feature in 4.3, but it's still not fixed the problem. Even though it seems like a bad thing to do, please keep working against players that seek to divide the community.<br />
<br />
The brand new heroics were epic. Please keep on using CoT to show us what has happened in lore such that we don't need to go all the way back to an ancient PC game to find out.<br />
This is what I posted on the thread on the EU site. Heroics were more or less a success (early Cata heroics aside), they just need to work on getting more people to see the rest of the game. LFR for raiding is a start, and Valor for questing in MoP keeps us going.<br />
<br />
The game really turned for the worse when the community decided that a raid needed to be cleared with your guild in order for it to be PuGged. Along with the change to the guild system that has left many in dead guilds not wishing to leave because of the rep grind, the community was split in two because of it. They've tried working against it in Firelands and with LFR, but it's still not working. Even with the 10% nerf to the raid people still want 5/8N in order to join a run: a role that the LFR achievement was supposed to fill, but was made incredibly easy (to overcompensate for the fact that a tiny percentage of players actually saw Firelands).<br />
<br />
I can easily see Normal difficulty being put on the LFR queueing system. Those wanting to keep raiding to raiders only have themselves to blame when it happens. :)</div></div><hr />

In fact, it hurt both a lot. Larger groups demand more commitment to the game and other players and created realm cohesion. This is gone now. Look at the number of formerly successful long term (from vanilla through wotlk) end game guilds who have disbanded, shrunk in size, or are shadows of their former selves.<br />

No one. You know this by the fact that it's carried by a handful of people, its flooded with bots, and people bring as many friends as they can to help roll on gear, even if they don't need it, to use it to trade later in the run. It's not some opportunity golden land. It's a shark tank of pack hunting sharks swipping food from solo sharks. <br />
<br />
Not to sound like an ass, but unless you can give concrete evidence that the majority of the people dislike the LFR, you're pretty much talking out of your behind. The only people that I've ever seen whining about LFR are:<br />
<br />
1) The people that want loot, but can't win loot, and only go there for loot, thus continue to whine about loot.<br />
2) The Pseudo-elitists that are STILL angry about not being a special snowflake.<br />
<br />
Both people are seen most vocally on the WoW Dungeon and Raid Forums, and that's pretty much it. For the people in game, the response has been very positive about LFR, and from the people that aren't in those two categories (Which is quite a few, to be sure) are also enjoying it quite a bit as well. It's just that, alas, the people that are enjoying it are a lot less vocal than the people who want to rage about it constantly.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to point out that I'm sure Blizzard does a lot more census gathering about responses to their content and changes to the UI than you or I or MMO Champion are aware of. They don't need to tell the player base everything about everything. They gather their information through their own means, and use it for their own purposes, with no reason or need to share it with others. Again, I didn't want to sound like an ass, but it seems your view on the LFR is slightly biased in comparison to how the majority feel. Blizzard wouldn't have considered it a success unless they knew something we don't.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">errosync</div><div class="date">2012-03-06, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem is people are sheep and will stick to one thing.I like to PvE and PvP, though not at the top end. I don't care if Rift's PvE is phenomenal because when I get burned out from doing only raiding, there will be nothing else for me and people in the same boat as me. If I get burned out on raiding in WoW, I can go PvP and have a much better experience than in Rift. Since I know that last bit will catch flak from people who PvP'd when it was relatively balanced/not at all, the PvP in Cataclysm is miles ahead of Wrath's and infinitely superior to BC PvP. It isn't perfect, but it's not going to be in a game that gets as many changes as World of Warcraft does.<br />
There was no talk about Abyssal Maw being scrappedThey already explained the reasoning for this. All they would've been doing is shoe-horning a dungeon-turned-raid into an expansion where it didn't make sense for it to be in (because the Neptulon quest chain is, for all intents and purposes, resolved) because they said they'd patch it in at Blizzcon. The last thing Blizzard should've done was shoe-horn in content for the sake of pleasing people, especially after the ZG/ZA fiasco (despite the revamps being quite nice).<br />
b- They are actually feeling proud and happy with what they did, which is even worse and tells me to move on to another game as this game is not going to get any better. I'll never understand why people can't possibly fathom that Cataclysm actually had some really great things about it. The fact they made every single zone meaningful in terms of story and questing is absolutely huge, regardless if you actually took part in it or not. Being able to finally interact with your friends on separate servers without having to put money into server transfers is a massive boon, and not being forced into logging on daily just to make sure you didn't fall behind even the bottom-of-the-barrel quality players while being able to switch between PvE and PvP much easier (thanks to the point exchanges) is absolutely fantastic. Cataclysm had it's share of downsides (arguably more than the other expansions), but so did the other expansions; Wrath was far too easy, had far more issues relating to general PvP than Cataclysm that largely went unfixed and necessitated you be married to the game just to ensure you didn't miss anything (housing the poorest designed raid doesn't help, either). BC content design was bad, class mechanics were lopsided at best and was filled with tons of pointless grinds on top of pointless grinds that just prevented people from actually seeing the content for really shitty reasons (like not being able to have 25+ people at constant beck and call). Cataclysm wasn't a grand slam, but it wasn't a strike-out, either.<br />
Old is old, Blizzard.Old isn't old when the models are completely new, as well as the mechanics of the fight and the scenario the fight is in. I'm really not getting how/why this is still being used as an argument when it holds absolutely zero water.<br />
I think I can speak for many players when I say &quot;NEVER AGAIN!&quot;Because group-speak is totally an effective way to 'prove' an argument and not a cop-out for self-validation despite having none.<br />
So the death of many 25 guilds due to the equalizing of loot item level doesn't even appear on your radar?I've said this before and I'll say it again: if your twenty-five man guild died, chances are likely that it should not have been a twenty-five man guild to begin with. I can only base this off of twenty-five man guilds that I know of personally, and the ones that became ten-man guilds were not equipped to deal with managing everything needed to keep a twenty-five man guild active and effective. It's not a large enough sample size to be relevant to the player-base at large, but it's enough since you aren't actually quoting any statistics yourself.<br />
No one finds LFR fun.I do, so 'point' voided. Next time come up with points that are truly arguable, not sentiments that you personally harbor and are trying to look for validation elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Now before you jump on for 'defending Blizzard', Daelo's interview was terrible. The answers he gave are the same length as answers you'd give on for the short answer portion on a high school midterm exam. Interviewers don't conduct interviews to get three-to-five sentence answers that ultimately give out nothing; they're looking for you to give a relatively deep, thoughtful and honest answer. I don't think Daelo was being dishonest, mind you, but he sure as shit wasn't giving answers that Fargo did which allowed us to understand what actually goes on behind the scenes at Blizzard along with the low/high points. Good interviewees answer the questions objectively; they don't use 'I liked what I did' as the answer for every fuckin' question being asked.</div></div><hr />

There are normal modes and hard modes, what is there to be special snowflake about? Any change to the game will have its good sides and its bad sides. Its not fun seeing that if you want to be the best you can be, that you feel like you have to run content that you have surpassed and dont want to run in order to progress in the content your in now. Players have there various reasons to like and dislike LFR. Are you going to call me a &quot;pseudo-elitist&quot; and &quot;special snowflake&quot; because I enjoy teamwork in group based content and dont like how a players who intentionally afk or other forms of leeching which forces team mates to work harder in order to succeed and get rewarded for such selfish behavior?</div></div><hr />

Do you honestly believe they would ever admit a damned thing went wrong? &quot;Hi, we fucked this up, fire me&quot;. That's what it would translate to. They see the rosy side of anything because it's their work being judged. Here, answer this question - Do you have any weaknesses? Now pretend you are talking to a future employer. That's the worst and stupidest question because you will always smell roses when there's clearly a shitty ass in front of you.<br />
<br />
4.2 was a redux. We got: reformatted ZA, ZG, and a boss 70% of people claim to have killed in Vanilla but never did. WoW Classic heroes are like those kids that were nerds at one school, get relocated to another and try to reinvent themselves so all the girls like them. I know who you are. I've busted so many people wanting to raid that can't answer the simple questions about the place but claim they were there.

How is that exactly? Classes with totally underpowered talent trees being forced into healing or tanking roles? Crafting professions that give very little of interest? Big caves of fights with tank and spank? Horde having lots of void areas without questing available until the Hinterlands hub was added? Manual flying with just a few flight paths? Ridiculous features like 5 minutes blessings, 30 seconds seals and caster set gear without spell damage?<br />

<br />
Mainstream got what it asked for and now it wont let go of it. <br />
The big lol I have out of this game is that the openly admit that more players stopped playing WoW then it currently does. Well if bringing towards casuals and causing such a gigantic rotation in players makes for such a unstable and ungrowing playerbase, wouldn't it be wiser to stick to your guns and appease to the playerbase which made WoW popular to begin with?<br />
<br />
Before anything it all comes down to this:<br />
WoW is a subscription based game, the more someone plays the more cash goes in.<br />
The more things take time, the more someone plays thus the more cash goes in.<br />
Vanilla WoW DID had great time sinks and despite not everyone seeing all raid content people miraculously kept playing and playerbase miraculously kept growing.<br />
<br />
I simply fail to see blizzard's logic in giving out meaningful things in the game to be achieved in a relatievly short time span and expect people to stay after they get it. They admitted it themselves with explaining why they nerf normal and heroic DS. Well geee... so people want to see more content which is mostly boss mechanics they omitted in LFR but depends on the extend of the DS nerf they can partially or completly ignore the boss mechanics doing basicly the same but still somehow believe they are doing more content which even without the nerf is basicly the same thing.<br />
<br />
Challange modes, events, pokemon battles and hopefully open world preparations like head/leg arcanums in Vanilla in MoP made it seem like Blizz had realized that raiding is *gasp* NOT the only worthwhile thing to do in the game. Pity they did it so late but I guess its better later then never.</div></div><hr />

The only people that I've ever seen whining about LFR are:<br />
<br />
1) The people that want loot, but can't win loot, and only go there for loot, thus continue to whine about loot.<br />
2) The Pseudo-elitists that are STILL angry about not being a special snowflake.<br />
<br />
Not to sound like one of those &quot;pseudo-elitists&quot; here but i don't know anyone at all that truly enjoys LFR, but can you really blame them? it's almost like hitting on a training dummy for 30 minutes just to get some &quot;epics&quot; you will never use more than to look somewhat good while being afk in org/sw<br />

I'm really not getting how/why this is still being used as an argument when it holds absolutely zero water.<br />
Then I shall enlighten you. New model, new mechanics, new scenario, new anything -- it doesn't matter. Slap the name Nefarian or Onyxia on a mob, and it's immediately old news.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because group-speak is totally an effective way to 'prove' an argument and not a cop-out for self-validation despite having none.<br />
Because merely stating an ambiguous term -- &quot;many&quot; could mean anywhere from, let's say, 10 people to 500,000 -- is still trying to speak for &quot;everyone&quot;. You, sir, are full of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've said this before and I'll say it again: if your twenty-five man guild died, chances are likely that it should not have been a twenty-five man guild to begin with. I can only base this off of twenty-five man guilds that I know of personally, and the ones that became ten-man guilds were not equipped to deal with managing everything needed to keep a twenty-five man guild active and effective. It's not a large enough sample size to be relevant to the player-base at large, but it's enough since you aren't actually quoting any statistics yourself.<br />
So now I need to be a statistician to even ask anything, right? And by the way, my guild has been around since the first day our server came online in November 2005. It did 40-player, and then 25-player as late as patch 4.0.6. And then things went downhill from there, so it's been stuck as 10-player ever since.<br />
<br />
You complain about me having nothing to back up my question, and then give an anecdotal response. Wise up.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy it. Every week, two characters go in in unorthodox gear and spec and effectively play loot roulette. If I ever want to raise the stakes, I pull side trash on Morchok, pull two packs of oozes before Yor'sahj, keep Zon'ozz facing the raid for the entire encounter, take Hour of Twilights on Ultraxion, kill Corruptions on Spine whilst players are killing the tendons, and keep the blood as far away from Deathwing's tentacles as possible for Madness.<br />
<br />
I understand why people get bored of LFR though. They're probably in a mediumcore raiding guild and want their four-set, and can't be asked to run LFR every week for tier.<br />

Valor for questing didn't give that away during BlizzCon? WoW's all about accessibility now, and difficult isn't accessible, not until it all goes onto the LFR queueing system anyway.<br />

Did he seriously call Atramedes and Spine, the 2 biggest PvE fails of Cataclysm, FUN and GOOD encounters? <br />
I'm pretty sure that Al'Akir (Malygos remake) and Valiona and Theralion (tank and spank and don't stand in fire) were bigger PvE fails than two encounters exploring new tactics and ways to fight a boss.</div></div><hr />

Point still stands though that they don't take 5 hours. I honestly don't mind these awful feedback provided by the Devs. Terrible content design drove my friends away from the game, which in turn allowed me to quit. Now I can move on to more meaningful or fun things to do. If the majority of the subscriber think paying a monthly subscription for pet battles and mediocre content, it's their game now.

<br />
The first run of most of these dungeons took my guild about 45minutes to an hour tops to complete the first time, after we got done with the getting knocked on your ass first time phase, we were rolling them in 30-40 minutes. We even got our achievement drake the 2nd week of cata being out.<br />
<br />
They were hard, the first time, and maybe the 2nd time. But that is how all things are your first time is gonna be an iffy experience you may hit it, or you may miss, it depends on how it was designed.<br />
<br />
I liked that it made me use my brain, it was entertaining and enjoyable. These new 5 mans make me wanna stab things because of the sheer boredom. It was kill 3-5 trash packs before every boss, and every boss was just a straight up tank and spank with no one could possibly die from this unless the healer had to afk at the start of the fight, but if you had a DK tank you didn't need a healer to begin with.<br />
<br />
So yeah the new ones weren't fun. The old ones were pretty great, they were hard, but only for that first trip. <br />
<br />
I don't get where &quot;5 hour dead mines&quot; comes from.<br />
<br />

Are you sure that you know how Heroic Atramedes was in the start of Cataclysm? It was bugged so you couldn't kill it without using a bug.<br />
<br />
Or how Spine was pre-nerf? You dps the Amalgamation, you burst the tendons, you dps the Amalgamation, you burst the tendons. As a healer you heal the debuffs, heal the debuffs, heal the debuffs, heal the debuffs. It's even worse now, because it's not challenging anymore. <br />
<br />
Al'Akir and Valiona were one of the best encounters, both design and balance wise. Spine was shit and Atramedes was even worse. I don't care how hard it was to design them, I'm playing this game to play and they should be designing them for us to play.</div></div><hr />

Not if encounters change based on difficulty. Heroics only added numbers to their abilities instead of introducing new abilities.<br />
Heroics seem to lack motivation. Needs more than a look-alike gear with a bit higher of every stat.</div></div><hr />

You seem to have this belief that most people like playing the same game for seven years, even if it gets refreshed with new content and mechanics every year or two.<br />
<br />
They don't. <br />
<br />
We are the anomalies for sticking with a game for so long. The playerbase which made WoW popular to begin with has already moved on, largely. Most people grow tired of something they initially loved after a few years, and WoW is no exception. Blizzard knows they will keep a dedicated base around, but they have to focus on bringing in new blood, and that challenge will get harder and harder as the years go on.</div></div><hr />

5m difficulty at expansion start - I found it actually nice. Sure that it could take so long (especially deadmines) was bad, also PUG group at stonecore/Grim Batol could be a bad experience. Still - was more fun than later &quot;bombing through mindless dungeon&quot;. They were nerfed too much. They especially forgot that with later in the expansion gear-progression it will be easier anyways then.<br />
Zandalar - I don't agree with some critics of people in this thread. They were not bad instances. The only problem - they were the ONLY instances to get decent amount of VP at the time, so people were grinding them, so people could not stand seeing them anymore soon. THAT was their problem.

first time at 85.. ya some dungeons were tough.. trash in grim batol was nasty.. karsh steelbender was bugged and pretty much unbeatable.. Ozruk would 1shot people almost every time.. Corborus had only a 1 second warning time on his thrash.. but the dungeons were much more satisfying when u beat them.. and i miss it.</div></div><hr />

Q. How did this evolve over the various content patches?Zul’Gurub and Zul’Aman were entertaining raids with diverse mechanics, and they translated well when we converted them into Heroic dungeons for patch 4.1. Interesting mechanics and features that once were restricted to raids are now finding their way into our five-player dungeons.They were also craptastically long and the only relevant content for far to long.<br />
Q. What do you think worked best?We’ve been reasonably successful with our tuning across all four raid difficulty modes. There were a few warts here and there, but we delivered on the idea that 10-player and 25-player raids could exist at a similar difficulty. Ehhh wait what? Head up ass much?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faldric</div><div class="date">2012-03-06, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This interview is really disappointing. A missed chance to gain interesting information instead of marketing talk... <br />
<br />
Why not ask him about Abyssal Maw? I mean why skip it, if you are never held back and get unlimited support? <br />
Or how even justify skipping a raid, if you promise &quot;more raidcontent than ever before&quot; on the box? <br />
Why is DS full of random encounters with no lore to back them up, no design time spent on their models and the most boring HMs who ever existed, most of them are the same simple encounter with bigger numbers(yeah its always more or less like that but never was that bad...) <br />
<br />
Doing an interview doesn't mean to ask the questions they want to hear, so they can answer with what they have prepared. This just leads to give them free space for advertisments with next to no information. If Blizz doesn't want to answer unpleasant questions well nothing lost, because nothing would have been as interesting as reading this interview.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eschatological</div><div class="date">2012-03-06, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just don't understand the continual encroachment on raiding the unappeasable casuals desire. They say they want to see all the encounters. Fine. Blizzard institutes LFR. It allows experienced raiders to gear up their alts and lets the casuals see their end-game content. It works fine for what it is, imo.<br />
<br />
But then, the casuals want 397 loot because it isn't fair that they don't get to do a PuG without 5/8N experience. Here's a hint: If you can't do 5/8N in a raid, you don't really deserve 8/8N experience. 5/8N, even before the nerfs, was a joke, even in 378 gear, which is what is available to even the most casual of casuals in JP and new heroic gear. If you're not ready to go 8/8, you get what you can down and build on it. That's how raiding works. You cannot expect to never have been an organized raider, or have come back from a long hiatus and levelled up to 85, or what have you, and go 0/0 to 8/8 in one week without exerting effort. NB: effort requires gemming and enchanting your gear properly, having professions (even if one is a gathering profession like mining or herbalism, because even those have raid benefits these days), and knowing the rudimentary elements of the fight, whether you looked them up in the Dungeon Journal or looked them up on Youtube. You can look stuff up on Youtube right? That's why your casual, after all, isn't it, because you sit on Youtube all day watching videos of kittens falling asleep? The most common response I hear to these sort of suggestions are, &quot;Man, it's just a GAME, you shouldn't take it SO SRS.&quot; I'm sorry you think looking up a fight video on youtube is &quot;taking a game too serious,&quot; but then again, I could never understand how every girl I know has like a level 902 farm on farmville. I'm also sorry that even that small modicum of effort is too much for you to handle and that you feel so entitled that you think you should be able to down THE LAST BOSS in the expansion without thinking, effort, or any sort of investment on your end. That 1 hour you set aside each week should be more than enough, right? Nevertheless, Blizz nerfed that content, and is continually nerfing it, to the point that 397 will be the average ilevel of anyone who can play the game for about 2 hours a week. Even then, I could live with that, because normal raiding is whatever, should be puggable, and isn't the major leagues of raiding.<br />
<br />
But now, you start to hear people suggest they should be entitled to heroic raid loot, that you should be able to be casual and be 8/8H. And, somehow, somewhere, Blizz thought this would be a good idea, and started nerfing heroic content, which bothers me. I'm 8/8H, and I work 60 hours a week, and it took us a long time to get where we are, raiding 12 hours a week for 3 nights. The content, even unnerfed, was not unbeatable. Not even H-Spine, and let's just say we had one rogue, and one mage on our H-Spine first kill (10 man). Many would consider 12 hours a week during &quot;progression&quot; for an 8/8H guild to be casual, and I'd suggest there's some truth to that - we all work a great deal, have families, wives, kids, jobs. We lost a week of raiding because our guild leader was in Asia for a business trip the same week one of our healers had a law school exam. Our resto shaman has missed the past month because he's finishing his grad thesis or something. The difference is, we know our stuff, and when we show up, we show up. We pay attention, we don't fuck around, and we get stuff dead. But hey man, I should be able to down H-DS drunk and high with 9 of my friends who haven't even bothered to look up the fight, right?<br />
<br />
Please. Blizz's design philosophy has shifted to the same philosophy of television execs and movie producers. They cater to the lowest common denominator to get the broadest appeal, and they do it to make money. The same people who agree with the dumbing down of the game are probably the same people who so dearly love Two and a Half Men and whatever monstrosity the Kardashian sisters are currently trying to be famous in. And fine, they'll continue to have broad support. But they won't be taken seriously as a game any more, or a gaming company. And while their harder-core fans leave to pursue actual challenges in gaming, eventually their casuals will get bored and get caught up in the latest new shiny object, like, say, Two and a Half Men with Ashton Kutcher, and then, well, that's when things'll get bad.</div></div><hr />

Could you be a little more condescending? People are allowed to have their own opinions and you have no right to say they're wrong or make assumptions about them.

m8... have you even looked at the companies income for the last 2 quarters? They are earning money like mad and they are really not in need for more money. The reason they fired 600 people is that they really haven't cleaned up in the blizzard imploymentship for a long time and well, there is alot of people they don't need anymore since they have moved on from doing advertisment, to doing a lot of more programming then they used to. <br />
<br />
Blizzard will always be a company that goes after the money, but trust me, they are in no need for money to get things go around.<br />

The difference is the raid wide debuff that can make you go 50% less dmg or make you go BOOM! that makes the encounter into a fight to keep control and a fight to do max without blowing up. I did not say it is the funniest fight in all of WOW, but it does make the fight a bit more fun then just pew pew, die tendrils!</div></div><hr />

Okay, closing eyes and covering ears in order not to hear or see complains about content is one thing. Okay, they may be pissed off, they worked hard, and all they are rewarded with is whine. I can accept that. But selecting the WORST aspects of the expansion in order to show how good it was is somehow too much. Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman 4.1 revamps were a good idea? In my entire experiance with WoW there was no worse patch. Zul'Aman is a complete revamp, showing how boring can one of the best raids be when you turn it into a dungeon. Zul'Gurub... interesting boss mechanics? Interesting=annoying? Since when? + both of Troll isntances were incredibly long. Throne of the Four Winds and its &quot;Dynamic mechanics&quot;? Excuse me, but since when moving straight in order to get somewhere further away is a dynamic mechanic? Whole raid seems to be in early concept phase. Like designers heard halfway through that they wont get paid. LFR &quot;successes&quot;... Okay, there was too much of that whine already. You got my point. Spine of Deathwing as a &quot;crazy encounter&quot;? Either boring or crazily unbalanced. Depends on difficulty. Im glad to hear designers spent months doing that, but hey, why couldnt they make it a bit more epic meanwhile? The only moment I realise im sitting on Deathwings back is when he is yelling his quotes like &quot;Lulz, I didnt know you were still there&quot;. The spinning mechanic, which could be a baseline for the encounter, or lack of any reaction of DW other than this spinning is just bad. I understand all. But why couldnt Blizzard just concentrate on real things that succeeded at during Cata, not those that meant to be successfull? Like whole BWL raid? Ragnaros with legs? A FINE level of difficulty on heroics at start (at least they teached to cooperate, use ccs and silence, and read the damn tactics)? And in the end, one more thing. Blizzard, you promised Abyssal Maw dungeon and War of the Ancients raid. THOSE were the things everybody was looking forward to see during Cataclysm. And those were the things missing. Abyssal Maw in place of those damn Troll dungeons, and War of the Ancients created before DS for like 4 months of progress (I guess you like to release expansions on Christmas, and with current DS timeline there is no way for this) would make Cataclysm pretty successfull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What??? Do you have any idea what you are talking about? There is no raid wide debuff, or anything like that. It is just a debuff placed on a random person that needs to be dispelled, because if it runs out it will wipe the raid. When you dispell it it jumps to another person and after some dispells it changes to a debuff reducing all damage taken. <br />
<br />
In action this means: Dispell -&gt; Dispell --&gt; Dispell --&gt; oh now its a good one should no longer dispell (most of the time).<br />

Time commitment? I'm not asking for hour long dungeons, but around 30 minutes would be preferable. That is a reasonable amount of time.<br />

The heroics at the start of Cataclysm were great. It was the players who were bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't. <br />
<br />
We are the anomalies for sticking with a game for so long. The playerbase which made WoW popular to begin with has already moved on, largely. Most people grow tired of something they initially loved after a few years, and WoW is no exception. Blizzard knows they will keep a dedicated base around, but they have to focus on bringing in new blood, and that challenge will get harder and harder as the years go on.<br />
<br />
You are wrong. If that would be the case how come stagnant game genre's like sport game survive to this day? Take Madden for example, for all we know the big update of it is minor game tweaks, updated rosters (which at this point could've been DLCs) and a new game box cover. Basicly the same game you bought last year yet you pay a whole new full price for it. And yet here we are seeing those games being bought agian and agian.<br />
<br />
Another example is Fifa or PES soccer games. Pro evolution soccer going for 11 years and FIFA for 19 years. 2 game series pretty much about the same damn thing last year edition, one going for over a decade and another one hitting almost 2 decades.<br />
<br />
How come such stagnant game types manage to survive these days?<br />
<br />
Because if the basic activity is fun then the game will survive no matter how redundant it is. <br />
<br />
Now you might say that those games might have just as big player rotations as WoW. If that is the case then anwser me this:<br />
<br />
If that would be the case how come those redundant games with outdated gameplay managed to survive in modern day gamers world?<br />
<br />
Either way the thesis that &quot;old games mechanics die out without players who in their time seen them as new&quot; is WRONG<br />
<br />
There are no anomalies for sticking with a game for so long. The playerbase which made WoW popular might still be hanging around either by hoping for a Vanilla retail server, or just downright playing on a private one. Laregly... most people dont grow tired of something they initally loved and still love after few years and WoW is no exception. Blizzard doesnt know they can keep a dedicated base around, but instead they preffer to focus on getting favor of unfaithful subscribers who will dump them as soon as something better shows up on the horizon, and their misery will get worse and worse as the years go on.</div></div><hr />

Than they fixed the priests mana issues and it became much easier. <br />
<br />
I liked the harder heroics before raiding of a new expansion, keeping us sharp, letting us adapt the new talents and skills to make us more prepared for the new raids. When we got the new talents and stuff in wotlk it was not like u could really test it out as ICC had the 30% buff at that time and everyone out geared the place. <br />
<br />
Shame they already said that they would take the difficulty lvl to WotLK for heroics and make challenge mode the difficulty of these early Cata heroics. <br />
<br />
Early Heroics and T11 were the best of this expansion, didnt like FL as it was just boring raid environment everything looked the same it was ok the first few weeks after that i got bored in that place pretty fast. Also the kill x amount of trash for shannox is even more annoying than the trash before ultraxion. <br />
<br />
I do like DS because it has much diversity in environment, the fights it self isnt that exciting on normals as normal is basicly a 1 tank and stack + bash buttons as dps. HM's does add diversity to the raid encounters in DS something normals lack for these roles.<br />
<br />
As a healer i like this raid alot, more so than FL.</div></div><hr />

That's one of my gripes against this Expansion: the motto &quot;Everyone gets to see all content&quot;, which was responsible for all the nerfs that occurred.<br />
Sure, it's Blizzard's game. They can do what the hell they want with it! But they sure should expect people getting bored, because suddenly we can steamroll the content faster than they can deliver.</div></div><hr />

then ZG/ZA came out. holy crap. 1 hr+ just to get 100 vp (thats what it was then right?). that was miserable. easily could have been split into 2 instances. i mean, its rehashed so i can see why youd want it all in the same place. but BRD was rehashed and cut down simply because.. it took so damn long. JIN DO THE GROUPBREAKER. /wrists. you actually needed 3 excellent players or 5 competent ones to finish ZG. miserable experience. <br />

new heroics are more boring than trimming my toenails, and i HATE the rp. i dont want to have to talk to thrall. ok, i lied. yes, theyre boring as fuck, but the first two were actually pretty decent. just that one with thrall gives me a bad taste in my mouth.</div></div><hr />

Back in BC I also never saw Sunwell and I was fine with that. The difference was that there were other things for non-raiders to do. Raids were seen as an addon to the game. When Blizzard shifted to focusing on raids to the detrement of open world content they kind of shot themselves in the foot. The mass exodus during Cataclysm showed that if they are going to focus on raids to the point of listing them as content features on the package then they better let everyone see them. I wouldn;t be surprised if post MoP we see a shift back toward open world content and away from raiding.</div></div><hr />

What didn’t work out as planned or expected? Initially, we started off the Heroic dungeons at too high of a difficulty. The difficulty level rather abruptly changed when compared to the Heroics players experienced at the end of Wrath of the Lich King. This major change caught many players off guard, and frustrated some of them. The difficulty also increased the effective amount of time required to complete a dungeon to a longer experience than we wanted. With the release of patch 4.3 we’re now in a much better place. We’ve always talked about being able to complete a dungeon over lunch, and the Hour of Twilight dungeons get us back to that goal. End Time, Well of Eternity, and Hour of Twilight all provide epic play experiences to our players, but at the real sweet spot of difficulty, complexity, and time commitment. What a joke.. Heroic is what its called, HEROIC, its not for everyone! Heroic Raids aint for everyone, and Heroic Dungeons should not be for everyone either. Blizzard failed both PvE and PvP this expansion, never been so frustrated over the lack of difficulty in PvE content (except for heroic raids ofc) never been so frustrated over the hidious stuns,slows,cc,etc... in PvP, feels like VanillaWoW all over on PvP</div></div><hr />

You get what you invest on it.<br />

Well, M'uru was the epitome of class stacking but per se, it wasn't difficult. Kill adds, kill some more adds, burst the big boss at the end. Conceptually, it was quite simple. You just needed a millimeter-tuned combo to beat it. On our M'uru kills, we had only two class &quot;choices&quot;: replace a hunter with a mage (woohoo) and replace a healing priest with a resto drood. The other slots were set in stone.<br />

Frankly, if I were Blizzard, I would release optional heroic dungeon for a supplementary fee. You want a heroic dungeon with amazing gear and mounts that the &quot;casuals&quot; (whatever that means) won't have access to? Poney up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since they are the majority of readers/writers on this forum, it may appear as if they are a majority, but they are not. <br />
Blizzard is balancing the game around the average player, and many of of those never got into raiding in current raiding tiers until Dragon Soul. <br />
<br />
When Scott Mercer says that Cata heroics were too hard at start, he probably should have added &quot;for the average WoW player&quot;. Now he got flame with experienced raiders (probably well into heroic Dragon Soul by now) immediately showing off their E-peen and explaining how Cata dungeons were easy to them from the start. They might be right, but they actually were hard to the rest of the 90+% of the WoW players.<br />
<br />
My point: Blizzard is and should be tuning the difficulty of 5-mans en normals around the capabilities of the average players. LFR is intended for those who cannot or will not usually otherwise and should probably be avoided by anyone who raids regularly, because experienced raiders may not enjoy LFR raids very much, unless they are prepared to party up with casuals and &quot;baddies&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see how anything in this expansion could be considered epic. Incredible cliche? Maybe. As for the Spine of Deathwing? They don't actually expect us to believe that it was a horribly complicated fight to design, do they? It was exactly the same as a land fight with a skybox. How do you avoid nausea for the players? By not using a terrible skybox, of course. How do you make players feel like they are on Deathwing? How do you NOT make players feel like they are on Deathwing if you can see him right there? As for the elementium plates going on and off, come on. That's one hell of a long bow to stretch. <br />
<br />
End Time, Well of Eternity and Hour of Twilight were hardly what I'd call epic. If Blizzard's idea of a difficulty/complexity sweetspot for the epitome of 5-man endgame is &quot;mindless faceroll&quot;, I don't know what to think. And time commitment? Is it too much to ask for more than 15 minutes of someone's time to participate in an endgame activity? I'd question why anyone would want to play a game structured like an MMO if they didn't want to invest larger amounts of time - even if you're given the option to have a 15-minute session, you're still going to be grinding the same stuff over and over again and eat up a hell of a lot of your time anyway. Even if we accept that 15-minute heroics are a good option to have, why are no alternatives whatsoever offered? Why can a set of harder, non-LFD heroics be made alongside those that exist? <br />
<br />
This entire thing is far too self-complimentary. I find it difficult to take self-evaluation seriously when all that they do is pat themselves on the back and try and turn the only flaw that they mention into a &quot;look, we fixed it&quot;.</div></div><hr />

We’ve been reasonably successful with our tuning across all four raid difficulty modes. There were a few warts here and there, but we delivered on the idea that 10-player raids is the way to gear with little effort and that 25-player raids should die. <br />

Yeah sounds reasonable. I think that it could be a store mount or a SoR mount. DMF is unlikely because hardly anyone has the existing mounts already so why should they add new ones already.<br />

Stop thinking about the players. Think about all the work that is being done and just a few can see it. Not profitable. And a silly design.</div></div><hr />

And its of your own ignorant bias to think its only the top 5% (or what ever number you want to make up in order to suit your argument) who enjoyed Cata at launch and that the idea of a wanting a game to be brought down to their level, well in this case brought up to their level to be solely distinct on this &quot;5%&quot; of the player base and evident no where else.</div></div><hr />

These things alone make me consider cancelling my sub and finding a new game:- &quot;Spine worked well&quot; Lol good joke worst encounter design ever.- &quot; Early heroics were too hard&quot; NO they were just the right dificulty!- He seems to just not be interested in making them hard..- He seems to think that Dragonsoul was the best raid of the expo, no it was the worse, T11 and T12 were awesome!<br />
<br />
Your opinion is not &quot;a large part of the fanbase these days&quot;.<br />
<br />
Only blizz knows what a large part of the fanbase is.<br />
<br />
They catered to the minority in making heroics &quot;heroic&quot; again at the start of cata. Look how well it turned out for them back then.<br />
The majority of players play only at weekends and/or a couple of hours now and then. If you are on a wow forum you are not part of the majority.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
they were at the proper level, nothing that required more than the available dungeon gear to complete, nothing that was at a higher level than the raids. heroics were heroic again.<br />
<br />
The player exodus started when the majority of players began experiencing heroics. Coincidence? Only Blizz knows. <br />
Funny how with time and when heroics started to turn easier due to gear escalation the exodus seemed to slow down. Only blizz has the data to answer to this but &quot;hard&quot; for you might be &quot;impossible&quot; to the majority and although I agree that WotLK 15min heroics were a joke they seemed to get a decent difficulty know. You can't ignore mechanics but you can compensate a screw up in your party.</div></div><hr />

We’ve been reasonably successful with our tuning across all four raid difficulty modes. <br />
There were a few warts here and there, but we delivered on the idea that 10-player and 25-player raids could exist at a similar difficulty. <br />

They went for the short term retention of customers, after they shot their golden goose in the face, with the disaster that this Xpac was.

I agree! A lot of pink-glasses talk. Do you think that from a marketing point of view this is more effective than a more down-to-earth honest approach?

One might argue that I'm exaggerating, but I have build up Blizzard in my mind as some sort of evil corporation devoid of all emotion. When I look at Chris Metzen nowadays I just see his nonchalant demeanor and unsettling smirk as a sign that they will never care about their game again. That's so sad to say, 5 years ago I would be praising Blizzard as Gods. The only thing that's going to kill wow is wow itself, why can't they just be humble and lay down, waiting for some other game to come and finish them off.</div></div><hr />

There's something really wrong, unless they were big packs that took some degree of coordination (which didn't really exist after the first set of cata dungeon nerf).

I'd suggest that even Blizzard don't know who their fanbase is anymore. They still seem to be in denial about how players perceive Cataclysm. If they carry on regardless and not learn anything, how do they expect to bring back players for MoP?</div></div><hr />

Most of the conversations I have with people in Wow is that they felt let down from the beginning and this expansion got worse as it went on. I've yet to talk to someone I'm in a raid or pvp with that has all nice things to say about this expansion, that they really enjoyed it and think this is the best expansion. I think the people that left the game agree as well. A good majority do like MC 2.0 that I've talked to though and that was never mentioned in this article.

<br />
Since they are the majority of readers/writers on this forum, it may appear as if they are a majority, but they are not. <br />
Blizzard is balancing the game around the average player, and many of of those never got into raiding in current raiding tiers until Dragon Soul. <br />
<br />
When Scott Mercer says that Cata heroics were too hard at start, he probably should have added &quot;for the average WoW player&quot;. Now he got flame with experienced raiders (probably well into heroic Dragon Soul by now) immediately showing off their E-peen and explaining how Cata dungeons were easy to them from the start. They might be right, but they actually were hard to the rest of the 90+% of the WoW players.<br />
<br />
My point: Blizzard is and should be tuning the difficulty of 5-mans en normals around the capabilities of the average players. LFR is intended for those who cannot or will not usually otherwise and should probably be avoided by anyone who raids regularly, because experienced raiders may not enjoy LFR raids very much, unless they are prepared to party up with casuals and &quot;baddies&quot;.<br />
<br />
The average player isn't the kind of stupid player you want to show off.<br />
<br />
Also, a lot of players simply doesn't raid because they don't want to. No matter how easy Blizzard make the stuff, they don't like raiding at all. Sure if you start handling high ilvl epics so easily, they'll show up to grab them. Wich pvp only player does not want a high ilvl raid weapon like gurth to use on pvp? Or some of the trinkets?<br />
<br />
Stop thinking that the 95% of player base are a bunch of stupid and &quot;gimme gimme&quot; players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ummm. Have you done Hyjal and wipe on trash?<br />
<br />
Cata Heroics were fun and hard in the beginning and it was worth it to me. I am a casual player now and if you do LFG of course you are going to find baddies always happens. That is why they give you the kick option to use. PPL get butt hurt over the littlest thing becuz they can't complete something. Tip if you could not complete Cata Heroics or ZA/ZG you might want to look at yourself. It is sad when you look at a ret pally wearing Tank gear, int gear, pvp and claims he can dps. I think some players really are younger than 14 or just have an IQ of 75(border line retarded).<br />
<br />
If the game gets to easy that is when i will leave. I been playin sents wow came out. Hots were fun in the beginning but it just like wow really. I can go there and clear it with dps doing 8k that makes it a joke. Another tip for baddies if a tank out dps you on a boss fight your bad. You need to learn your class or gem/enchant your gear and one more thing wear the right gear. <br />
<br />
Here a few things to know if your a baddie. (does not mean your casual)<br />
1.) you have no gems(does not matter if it is a blue or purple u can get a cheap gem for 4g)<br />
2.) your in pvp gear trying to raid not including BH (Res does not increase you dps)<br />
3.) you have no enchants(you can get the cheapest one at least have something)<br />
4.) no profession buff (either your lazy or just dont know)<br />
5.) not wearing the right gear even if it is a high ilvl (dodge does not give u a boost in dps)<br />
6.)back to 5 don't miss match gear.(leather with plate)<br />
7.) if a tank out dps you on a boss fight or a tank has 50% heals.(come on)<br />
8.) you try to raid with out vent and state you did it before(hello if you did it before you would know to have vent)<br />
9.) if your in ilvl 380 above and your a dps that can't pull 15k dps on the training dummy. (this does not include pvpers only pve)<br />
10.) Dps that stands in front of a boss or trash when you have an option of being in back of them.<br />
<br />
I could go on about the content on what bad ppl do. If you find you are bad just get better or stay bad. No big deal</div></div><hr />

How many of you complaining about how they were &quot;just right&quot; were the same people who auto-dropped Grim Batol or Stonecore any time it popped up? Many of you probably even auto-dropped Blackrock Caverns. It's one thing if we were playing in an era where you found the people to run a heroic with yourselves--there the fault lies with you if it fails. It's quite another if that group is handed to you--then people blame Blizzard for other people sucking. And Dragon Soul was an amazing raid... from the standpoint of Lore &amp; Storytelling. For the first time we were given a raid with several cinematics and portals that took you all the way around the world, all centred with one goal in mind--to tell a story. That has potential. Sure some of the mechanics and bugs left something to be desired, and sure the raid was highly undertuned, but undertuning is a simple mistake to fix. What did you guys want anyways, a raid full of Patchwerks? An encounter where the dps has to hold back half the fight is great as a changeup.</div></div><hr />

I'm not really a raider, I have done it in years past but these days I just have too much going on to be reliable enough to do it. I loved the fact they were making heroics more difficult again because it gave me some form of a challenge that didn't involve raiding. Sadly it was short lived.<br />
<br />
I just think they tried to reverse too many things too quickly in one expansion, and generally when it comes to anything like this people don't like it. Tack on top of that the healing overhaul ( which tbh didn't really seem to work), the initial tank threat nerf, DPS needing to find a CC button again and it was just bound to get off on the wrong foot.<br />
<br />
Then couple it with rehased bosses and content, a really bad ending to the Worgen area, spending way too much time on the leveling content compared to end game and its no wonder Cata has been received so poorly.<br />
<br />
I still think one of the reason they didn't put out Abysal Maw is that by the time Firelands hit they knew Cata was basically a bad expansion, so they just wanted to get Deathwing dead and move on to MoP. Overall from beginning to end its probably the poorest work Blizzard has done on a released version of a game in its history, and being where WoW is in its life cycle I just don't see it being a mistake the game every really recovers from.</div></div><hr />

Never nerf any content. Why? = Everyone can see content now. NO reason to nerf. Can't beat a boss on normal? Too bad, clearly you can't get there JUST YET, but after trying harder and having more practice you will beat it, making the reward more meaningful. The essence of overcoming a challenge.<br />
<br />
Easy mode - LFR (See all content, lesser rewards.)<br />
Normal - (Contain challenge for the majority, normal rewards.)<br />
Hard Mode - (Very hard, for the people that SEEK challenge and are ABLE! The problem with wow is that the loud idiots scream and complain that they cannot do this and want it brought down to their level.<br />
<br />

I have to call BS on this statement, man. 5 hours is too high, but 30 minutes at the start of the expansion? No way, dude. Around 1hr 30min to 2 hours sounds more accurate, and that's how most Cata 5-mans were when it was released.</div></div><hr />

Ugh, I really hope they don't have a situation like ZA/ZG again. Only 2 dungeons for a tier, that are difficult to pug, and have a very um... let's say &quot;distinctive&quot; (ie, hideous) visual style to the loot. I still haven't even completed both of them.<br />
<br />

No, those were &quot;bads.&quot; They left because no one wants to spend 5 hours wiping in heroic Grim Batol. They left because the inaccessibility of heroics left them nothing to do.

I think you're grossly overestimating the skill level of the playerbase. Some raid groups are hitting road blocks they cannot and will not ever surpass without nerfs.

<br />
The difficulty of content depends mostly on the gear you wear. The first set of dungeons were too difficult cause ppl still had crappy gear. In the last 3 you very rarely go in without at least 2 ppl that are overgearing it and making it alot easier. Specially if they are healer and tank.<br />
<br />
There are also alot of things ppl have forgotten about the starting dungeons in Cata. They had all sorts of issues cause the difficulty from one to the next was not equal. Not to mention that the graphic settings very often determined the encounter difficulty cause some essential features were missing in lower settings - Like things on the ground that needed to be avoided. That is just disasterous design and just not acceptable.<br />
<br />
Overall - there are 2-3 good dungeons in Cata. But some of them are too long and just boring when you do them for the 50th + time. But thats mainly because BLizzard is now spendin 2 WHOLE YEARS bettween expansions with the same amount of dungeons. And thats just another thing that is not acceptable.<br />

And, since Blizzard is a business and want their playerbase to stick around, they'll nerf the content so those people still have something to do. Its quite simple really.<br />
<br />
The main reason ppl hit road blocks is because ppl quit the game and new ones need to be geared up.<br />
<br />
There is also possible to reduce these roadblocks with better quality gear coming in like first and second month after release of new raid content.</div></div><hr />

Why can't Blizzard just stick to something simple. I am well aware of the intricacies of game development, but what I am about to write is the very core of gaming and should be easy enough, or so one would think.<br />
<br />
Never nerf any content. Why? = Everyone can see content now. NO reason to nerf. Can't beat a boss on normal? Too bad, clearly you can't get there JUST YET, but after trying harder and having more practice you will beat it, making the reward more meaningful. The essence of overcoming a challenge.<br />
<br />
Easy mode - LFR (See all content, lesser rewards.)<br />
Normal - (Contain challenge for the majority, normal rewards.)<br />
Hard Mode - (Very hard, for the people that SEEK challenge and are ABLE! The problem with wow is that the loud idiots scream and complain that they cannot do this and want it brought down to their level.<br />
<br />
Want to do hard mode? Work and EARN your way there.<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW's problem? Solved. :/ (Raid difficulties anyway, they are still money hungry and lazy.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, we don't need LFR, Normal, and Hard Mode.<br />
<br />
We don't even need 10/25 mans.<br />
<br />
Let's just have one, 15 man raid. Then, they can just work on multiple raids of different difficulties. Open expansion with 5 raids. 3 easy, 2 medium. That should cover content for quite a bit of time with the leveling process, 5-mans, then bam raid progression.<br />
<br />
Release a second patch with a couple new 5-mans, 3 raids (2 mediums and a hard). No gear reset. To get to the new raids, you'll need to do the old raids. Hell, put attunements back in, too. They're story based walls, better than silly artificial walls where you have to wait to this date or so to get into content.<br />
<br />
Multiple difficulties add to design time, and sacrifices content. If you reset gear, you make current raids pretty much obsolete. Blackwing Descent was out of date just as much as Black Temple once Firelands came out. That's sad seeing as it is still current expansion content.<br />
<br />
Let's look at how instances work in BC:<br />
<br />
Karazhan -&gt; Zul'Aman -&gt; Gruul's Lair -&gt; SSC/TK-&gt; Black Temple -&gt; Sunwell<br />
<br />
Progression based.<br />
<br />
End of Cata:<br />
<br />
Dragon Soul (LFR) -&gt; Dragon Soul (Normal) -&gt; Dragon Soul (heroic)<br />
<br />
There's something wrong with that picture. Sure, progression, perhaps, but very boring progression.<br />
<br />
Say you skip LFR cause your guild can go right into normal:<br />
<br />
Dragon Soul (Normal) -&gt; Dragon Soul (Heroic)<br />
<br />
Say you only do one week of Normal and move to Heroic cause you're guild is hardcore.<br />
<br />
Dragon Soul (Heroic)<br />
<br />
There goes progression. Why do the other two difficulties when it's basically the same content?<br />
<br />
Once you beat Normal, how do you convince a guild to continue to heroic? Just cause it'll be more challenging? I mean, we just saw all the content. Nothing is going to change other than slight things to make it a bit more difficult. That's not fun.<br />
<br />
What Blizzard needs to realize is that not everyone needs to see the content, and this is coming from a guy who probably wouldn't see all of the content if it was set up like that, either. Not everyone needs epics, not everyone can really earn them. But, they'll aspire to do so. That gives people something to do, something to keep playing for.<br />
<br />
Having everyone wearing epics that look pretty much the same from 3 different versions of the same instances only different based on ilevel and tags that say LFR or Heroic isn't going to inspire me to want to play.<br />
<br />
Cut down the amount of difficulty, create new content, stop giving out purple items as they mean nothing at this point. In fact, never let a person doing a 5-man have a purple item. Never let epics drop from a 5-man.<br />
<br />
It's gotta be something they look into because the current model isn't working. It's burning out content faster than they can create it, and leading to large gaps of content before new releases, which then are lacking content due to all the modes they had to design.<br />
<br />
Someone else has to see this, right?</div></div><hr />

Nope, it's not the new people, it's the old people who can't push their buttons fast enough regardless of full 397 gear.<br />
<br />
A casual guild is not going to kick people for being in the 30th percentile on epeenbot. They'll just try to compensate for the worse players with better players, but since encounters these days include so much hair-trigger target swapping, you can't always do that. If you have ranged players who just can't switch targets for the life of them, who drop from 40k on Ultraxion to 10k on Blackhorn, what are you going to do, except pray for nerfs?<br />
<br />
If you are in an actual raiding guild where you kick bads, you should have cleared the content by now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do see the problem there. It's just not the one you want people to see.<br />
<br />
I agree that on a personal level, progressing through all content makes sense. But there's a problem with that.<br />
<br />
First tier of the expansion, everybody, existing and new toons alike, are on the same tier.<br />
<br />
Second tier of the expansion, existing toons are on second tier, but new toons have to find new toons to run the first tier with, as those on the second tier are busy with the second tier.<br />
<br />
As you get to the third and possibly fourth tier, you get an exponential decrease in the number of players seeing new content. As most players would rather be seeing new content, you get an exponential increase in the amount of time and difficulty for progression in older tiers, and thus an exponential decrease in the number of new toons entering raid content.<br />
<br />
So ultimately, Blizzard had to make a choice. Do they keep a chain of progression in an expansion, with the result that only a very small handful of people actually see the end and the vast majority of people are paying for content they will never see? Or do they cut out the middle parts, having shorter progression, but much more people can actually see what they pay for? As a consumer, I think they made the right decision.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a valid comparison.<br />
<br />
At the end of Cata, you can START raiding with Dragon Soul (LFR). There is zero reason to even go into BWD/BOT/FL at all. Just do a few heroics and voila, you're at the final tier of raiding for the expansion. <br />
<br />
At the end of BC, you still had to start at Kara and work your way through, although badges made your starting point a little easier towards the end.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much this. Remember, just because YOU read EJ and know that Agility doesn't give spell critical chance doesn't mean everyone else and their parents know the same, but who's to say Blizzard's not supposed to provide fun to them? They are paying the same $15 as you are after all.<br />
<br />
I'm surprised to see that some people think they know exactly what the problem was, when they lack any form of conclusive empirical data.

It took a lot of hard work from the whole team and it was a difficult design challenge to tackle. How do you orchestrate a fight on the back of a gigantic flying dragon without inducing nausea? How do we make sure you feel like you’re on Deathwing? Delivering that experience was really important and everyone wanted the opportunity to work on it. What was really great was that we launched the story of Cataclysm with the cinematic that showed Deathwing having his elementium plates being put on, then we end the expansion with those very same plates being torn off. It gives some real closure to storyline.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bullshit, it was easily the worst fight I've ever done, it didn't act as a great closure to the story because we never really did fight Deathwing, we fought his back and arms while thrall and the dragon aspects did everything else. Please never make a fight like this ever again, PLEASE.<br />
<br />
Also is anyone else getting a little tired of these 'post mortem' things? They basically don't say anything worthwhile and just pat themselves on the back for all the good jobs they've done while leaving out the real failures they've made.</div></div><hr />

VERY FEW PEOPLE enjoyed heroics at the start of Cata. <br />
A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE hated them. <br />
<br />
At first blizzard refuse to see this, Ghostcrawler even mocked those that were nto enjoying them in a blog, but then Blizzard saw their data and realized the truth: Cata heroics were too long, had too much trash and were too hard for randomg groups (which are the mayority, sorry but 5 man guild groups are not the norm). For many of us, Wrath heroics gave us much, MUCH more fun than Cata ones (and that has nothing to do with age, i'm 30 years old).

<br />
It's a valid comparison.<br />
<br />
At the end of Cata, you can START raiding with Dragon Soul (LFR). There is zero reason to even go into BWD/BOT/FL at all. Just do a few heroics and voila, you're at the final tier of raiding for the expansion. <br />
<br />
At the end of BC, you still had to start at Kara and work your way through, although badges made your starting point a little easier towards the end.<br />
Yeah exactly !! I did this on my brand new dk alt a month ago. Got lvl 85 then started doing BGs for the 390 PvP gear and then got into LFR and cleared that stupid place in 2 hours with every boss.<br />
<br />
Content cleared :( BTW I did the 3 new HCs on that evening too ...<br />
<br />
Edit: No need for running any cata raids before jumping into DS :(</div></div><hr />

Challenging content might not be fun for you, but there are plenty of others who don't share that opinion. The make it hard and nerf it later approach works pretty well. Also there is no justification whatsoever that everyone has the right to see all the content as soon as it's released, there is plenty of sutff for the casuals - they don't have the 'right' to kill heroic raid encounters the week they're released.</div></div><hr />
