Raid Testing Schedule - October 11th - 18th<br />
On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, October 11th-13th we will be conducting raid tests of Antorus, the Burning Throne. If testing goes well, the majority of Normal mode will remain available over the weekend.<br />
<br />
Thursday, October 12th<br />
<br />
Kin'garoth - Mythic Antorus, the Burning Throne<br />
13:00 PDT (16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
The Coven of Shivarra - Mythic Antorus, the Burning Throne<br />
14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Friday, October 13th<br />
<br />
Antoran High Command - Heroic Antorus, the Burning Throne<br />
13:00 PDT (16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Argus the Unmaker - Heroic Antorus, the Burning Throne<br />
14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Friday, October 13th - Wednesday, October 18th<br />
Normal Antorus, the Burning Throne<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br />
<br />
A: In Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade Sr. in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br />
<br />
I assume are all normal bosses up Friday, October 13th - Wednesday, October 18th? Including argus?<br />
Argus the Unmaker will not be included in the Normal mode test. All other bosses will be available.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.3 Hotfixes - October 10<br />
Argus<br />

Fixed an issue where bonus rolls would fail to occur when defeating some Greater Invasion Point bosses.<br />

I just posted this in another thread, but I'll mention it again here:<br />
<br />
Any artifact appearances you've unlocked (including Druid forms) will be available as transmogrification options after Legion. I'm not privy to the specifics on how it will work regarding Druid forms, but the developers are keen to make sure you can still use those forms after Legion.<br />
<br />
You'll also still be able to acquire appearances you haven't earned post-Legion, with the only exceptions being the Mythic 15 Keystone Dungeon appearance, and the Mage Tower appearances. If you don't earn those before the end of Legion, you won't be able to earn them after Legion - think of them as effectively the Challenge Mode sets of Legion.<br />
<br />
Hope this clarifies.<br />
<br />
only to make sure: when legion ends we can use our artifact skins as transmog weapons, but only for the class? i mean i cant use thunderfury on another class am i right?<br />
Right now I believe the current intent is that artifact weapon appearances can only be transmogged on the class the artifact was for. So to use an earlier example, Death Knight's wouldn't be able to transmog the Corrupted Ashbringer appearance from a Paladin.<br />
<br />
I've forwarded on the other questions in this thread so if I get any more specific details I can share, I'll let you know.<br />
<br />
Morning! I've got a few updates to share.<br />
<br />
Regarding the Mage Tower appearance. If you unlock your Mage Tower appearance before Legion is over, you will still be able to earn the colour variants of it post-Legion.<br />
<br />
Likewise the colour variants of the Balance of Power appearance will still be obtainable post-Legion, with the exception of the Mythic +15 variant which needs to be obtained before Legion ends.<br />
<br />
Prestige appearances will still be obtainable after Legion, though the exact manner in which they are earned may change. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1074188-will-we-keep-artifact-looks/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17617013933?page=2#32))<br />

Retribution Paladin Balance<br />
Retribution Paladins are nowhere near the bottom, and, like others have pointed out, that data is misleading considering there are quite a few bosses that allow us to cleave. <br />
<br />
Currently I still see that if I have more than one target I know Divine Storm overpowers Templar's Verdict and I'm free to cleave like a madman. Retribution Paladins shine on movement and cleave which ToS is definitely a lot more friendly to us. <br />
<br />
Of course I wouldn't object to buffs(who wouldn't) but I don't feel like we need them at the moment. This could change with our T21 set bonuses considering we'd be losing the T20 4 set that interacts so well with our talents and Crusade, however in the current state I think Ret Paladins are quite fine and pretty formidable among melee.<br />
<br />
I can't say I agree with you here. Movement is quite punishing for Ret outside of Steed. Divine Steed off GCD would be amazing right now.<br />
True, Divine Steed coming off GCD would be nice change. However, having the option to switch to Cavalier I feel fills that need for me when I do want the additional mobility. Cavalier plus our Blessings fills any need of mobility I've encountered this tier. <br />
<br />
With the T20 4p going away some buffs would be nice. The 4p even feels like it's made to be baseline since it makes the spec feel much more fluid. Spending that one extra GCD is annoying when you need aoe. I would like to see T21 changed though.<br />
I agree here as well. I've become very used to the T20 four-piece and it feels very baseline to me at this point. It's going to take some getting used to for me moving away from it if that isn't changed to a baseline.

Depends on what spec you're viewing it from. As a vengeance DH, I'm welcoming this change alot!<br />
Also, if I remember correctly, when you're running an demonic build (which is highly likely you will with T21), haste, mastery becomes better than crit... Atleast haste...</div></div><hr />

Haste is actually pretty bad for demonic. Crit is and always be far ahead of everything else, save this tier as 222 build where haste can catch up if you have 50%++ crit and really low haste. For demonic, it's crit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mastery &gt; vers &gt;= haste.</div></div><hr />

That's funny, haste sims slightly higher than crit for me with demonic build. Even with crit being less than 40%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course haste is great, but crit is greater (and I'm playing Demonic right now)<br />
<br />
Thanks god for &quot;Regarding the Mage Tower appearance. If you unlock your Mage Tower appearance before Legion is over, you will still be able to earn the colour variants of it post-Legion.&quot;. That was my main interrogation regarding the Artifact colors, there is a 0% chance I'll be winning 10 RBG up to the end of Legion as I hate PvP, but maybe one day.</div></div><hr />

You're likely really close to a plateau for haste then. Add one piece of haste gear, and I'd bet that changes.</div></div><hr />

Using RNG would make sense knowing Blizzard and WoW though..<br />
<br />
Maybe in some future expansion also 2nd stats change by spec or at least let us have only Haste/Mastery/Crit as 2nd stats and make versatility a 3rd stat or random proc (more RNG!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're at a haste breakpoint and/or simming 332 which is the tier 20 build, everything else uses 331<br />
<br />
if you have less than 40% crit something is horribly wrong since i see &gt;60% CS crit on both t19 and t21 profiles, t19 from the +8% set bonus and t21 from high ilvl</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping so, the only reason I did vengance on my DH was for that bad arse appearance from the hidden skin<br />
<br />
What I'm more curious to know is if after legion, if we unlock a appearance, will that one be x moggable. Or will it only be skins that were unlocked during legion - note I'm asking about x mog a newly unlocked appearance, not the physical ability to unlock one.</div></div><hr />

The front page says you will be able to get every skin for transmog beside the Mage Tower/mythic+15 apperance beyond Legion.</div></div><hr />

Tier pieces are deliberately not perfectly itemized, they said so many times. There is supposed to be a choice between set boni and an off set piece with a better stat allocation.</div></div><hr />

You mean &quot;making the tier greater for vengeance&quot; right ? Nice to not be plagued by the useless crit of the brainless spec.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brubear</div><div class="date">2017-10-12, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I'm okay with not being able to earn the M15 and initial Mage Tower appearance after legion, I'm not too thrilled on the idea of having to unlock each one for each character. That's a total of 12 M15 runs and 36 characters/specs that you need to learn/have geared enough to unlock all the Mage Tower appearances.<br />
<br />
I think a nice compromise on that would be that if you unlock all three mage Tower appearances for one spec during legion, then you've unlocked the ability to earn/use them as xmogs on every spec, you just need to complete the mage tower scenarios. That way you still have to unlock it with 3 specs while it's current, but you also have some of the account-wide aspect that WoD challenge-mode rewards had.</div></div><hr />
