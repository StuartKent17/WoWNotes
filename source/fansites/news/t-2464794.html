<br />
Marksmanship<br />
<br />
All damage and pet damage increased by 3%.<br />
Developers’ note: Marksmanship damage has been a bit too low when not using Unerring Vision. With the reduction to Unerring Vision’s effectiveness, this increase brings Marksmanship up to a more appropriate overall level.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
https://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#k))<br />
<br />
Demonology<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where demons from the Nether Portal talent would sometimes not correctly spawn when spending Soul Shards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
https://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E))<br />
<br />
Arms<br />
<br />
Mortal Strike, Execute, Slam, Overpower, and Rend damage increased by 8%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Battle of Dazar’alor<br />
<br />
Jadefire Masters<br />
<br />
Placing a raid marker while holding the egg for the Hidden Dragon achievement should no longer cause you to drop the egg.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stormwall Blockade<br />
<br />
Laminaria health reduced by 10% on Normal and Heroic difficulties.<br />
Energized Storm health reduced by 10% on all non-Mythic difficulties.<br />
Tidal Volley and Jolting Volley damage has been reduced by 10% on all non-Mythic difficulties.<br />
Sea Storm initial damage reduced by 10% on all non-Mythic difficulties.<br />
The interval between spawns of Energized Storms has been increased by 25% on all non-Mythic difficulties.<br />
Storm's Wail now lasts 13 seconds on Raid Finder and Normal difficulties (was 10 seconds).<br />
<br />
<br />
Lady Jaina Proudmoore<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where Elusive Brawler was not being correctly removed when dodging Ice Shard.<br />
Jaina will now finish casting Orb of Frost or Glacial Ray before activating Ice Block if she detects Heroism or Bloodlust effects.<br />
Frozen Solid can no longer be broken with stun breaks (Icebound Fortitude, Blink).<br />
Jaina's berserk timer has been adjusted to 15 minutes in non-Mythic difficulties. It is 12 minutes in Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
King Rastakahn<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that caused some players to see no loot in the Treasure of the Zandalari.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Temple of Sethraliss<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue with Reaping that caused Static-charged Dervish to incorrectly summon many, many, MANY Lost Souls.<br />
Hoodoo Hexxers now continue to cast Rain Of Toads as long as they are alive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
The wrapper quest for Assaults can no longer award Azerite Armor Caches.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: We'd like Assaults to remain a lucrative source of equipment for characters who have recently hit level 120, but this wasn’t a good source for Azerite gear, as players will want to obtain newer Azerite gear with 5 powers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue that prevented the Crest of Pa'ku from being activated by Healing spells.<br />
Fixed a bug where some on-use Battle of Dazar'alor trinkets were not properly triggering the on-use cooldowns of other trinkets.<br />
Shadowtome can now be upgraded by Ensorcelled Tarots.<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: Based on data observed since Tides of Vengeance launched, we have several tuning changes for Azerite traits. The goal of these changes is to improve the usability of some class traits, as well as rein in the power of some of the newer traits in a way that still preserves their core coolness. Additionally, some Azerite traits changed value dramatically with changes to specs in Tides of Vengeance, so we’re taking this opportunity to rebalance those traits as the Mythic Raid opens.<br />

<br />
Light's Decree change only hurts builds not using Divine Purpose and/or Fires of Justice. Both of those talents got buffed, because of the secondary fix in there. Now, it's full damage Light's Decree (even if less overall) from those reduced in cost by Fires of Justice, or free by Divine Purpose (which, 8.1 also fixed to proc into itself, so... that is a fun thing). I wonder if it triggers properly for the free Divine Storms from the other Trait though... hmmm...</div></div><hr />
