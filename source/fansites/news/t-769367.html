It's about time they buffed hunters, they really did need it. They have brutalized them too much. Hunters are one of the few non hybrid classes. (mage, lock, hunter, rogue) and 3 out of those 4 have been given HUGE buffs, while hunters got some they were quickly nerfed. Buff em up blizz. They only get to do one thing, let them do it to the gd best. (oh boohoo you playz hunter) yeah, that's why I QQ so much about my paladin. Secretly I want to be a hunter =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
More like it was listened to. The change will ultimately help with single-target tanking which was seriously hurting, rather than AoE tanking. I'm certain that the limited CDs on AoE threat abilities will still prevent the AoE tank faceroll-a-thon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not quite. People on the forums, almost certainly confirmed by Blizzard's own testing, showed that threat was too low across the board to the point of frustration for many. It shouldn't be easy to hold threat, but it shouldn't feel like an enema neither.</div></div><hr />

I get the feeling they just gave up.<br />
<br />
The changes they put in w/ 13131 was enough to help bolster Ret DPS to at least above what it is right now on Live. Anything else done right now would be overkill, with the state of things being as they are right now.<br />
<br />
Note how they also tuned down Destro; the 'low dps' that you're seeing compared to casters on the PTR is due to the casters being overtuned.<br />

200% up from 125% is a LOT<br />
Will tanking be easier than in WotLK now?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
It's still a threat decrease from what it is in Live right now -- most signifigantly AoE threat.</div></div><hr />

So this new tank threat modifier is SLIGHTLY lower than live. However, all DPS negative threat multipliers were removed.

I will admit, I squealed with joy at this. I never did like it when they changed traps to only last for 30 seconds.

<br />
I have been running tons of heroic dungeons on my pally during the past 3 days on the PTR and I didn't see much problem with threat. Don't make me wrong it's harder than before and yes sometimes dps pull aggro on trash, and most of the PTR players are ilvl 277 gear. But when I say &quot;sometimes&quot; I mean it, it's definitely not always happening ( it's pretty rare to be honnest) and I feel it's normal to have to taunt sometimes to bring the mob back<br />
<br />
I tried ICC 10 man and the only thing I noticed (but still unsure about it)is how hard mobs are hitting. Marrowgar basically sliced our Dk tank in two and as a prot pally I survived alone only cause I was using word of glory all the time instead of Sotr. I'd like to get the 30% buff on the PTR to have better idea cause comparing the damage I take on live with 30% buff and the damage I take on the PTR without is hard<br />
<br />
By the way aggro is not in my opinion a big problem atm if you train a bit and know what you are doing</div></div><hr />

<br />
They also removed all of the threat reductions from classes and put all the different sources of threat increases into one spell(blood presence, bear form, defensive stance, righteous fury)..so...shouldn't 125% be more than enough(75% increased by 125% is 168.75%)? 200% means tanks are doing like 225% more threat than dps. 75% increased by 200%=225% dps' threat..</div></div><hr />

As for paladins, holy got a nice buff and so far ret is alot more fun in pve, i mean yeah we suck at aoe but we do pretty well vs single target/boss fights, you know fights that matter. As for pvp i wont even comment since melee are pretty much boned in pvp vs casters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tank/raid with all the tanking classes and have for years so I am not some faceroll noob. It was tough even at 100%. Now since the 125% change I have only been on the target dummies so not sure how bad it is.<br />

<br />
why does everyone whinge about tanks being able to aoe tank...this is not what they wanted to stop...they wanted to make it dangerous...ie if you try tank everything you will die.<br />
<br />
You could aoe tank in TBC, but you try that in MGT for example...you will likely die. Once tanks become well geared, cc in lower level content will be less important. Karazhan for instance required alot of cc when we started it, yet once you were in BT/SWP gear, your tank could take alot more adds on him/her and it would be fine.<br />
<br />
This is the model they are working to here, I haven't tried the beta...but I've heard enough from people that threat was just a major pain in the ass(least for warriors). If you pull a perfect tps rotation and people are pulling of you (single target)...this is broken ok?<br />
<br />
All tanks should be able to hold as many mobs as required, the reason they shouldn't &quot;aoe all&quot; is because they cannot survive.<br />

add ons like omen were made for a reason.if the fury warrior rips threat off your tank,its not automatically the tanks fault because he wasnt pulling enough threat.it could be because your warrior was just bashing away and not caring about how much threat hes pulling<br />

although,i gotta admit though.i cant really say from expierance because i havent played the ptr,but i have heard that warrior tanking was kinda screwed up at the moment or somethin.but maybe thats why they buffed the threat generation or whatever</div></div><hr />

<br />
Things like Auto-hotkey, suderduper macro's and huge castsequence macros are what cause issues like this. Tanks in Wrath have been frontloading huge amounts of threat not only due to their specs but also from TOT/MD's. It means that retpally with lolmourne (which is a fscking bugged ass weapon since the proc doesn't follow class threat reductions at all) who opens with a huge nuke string dies in a ball of flaming fire, then blames it on the tank for not generating aggro faster.<br />
<br />
I hope this new ability queuing system breaks auto-hotkey and all the people relying on it wake up and realise they forgot how to play.</div></div><hr />

Mage, Paladin and Priest have been the most worked on classes in this beta. I agree that Rogue and Shaman havent gotten a lot of love, along with Death Knights (until recent buffs to threat, and before that weeks went by with nothing until the Ghoul changes in Unholy).<br />

<br />
They also removed all of the threat reductions from classes and put all the different sources of threat increases into one spell(blood presence, bear form, defensive stance, righteous fury)..so...shouldn't 125% be more than enough(75% increased by 125% is 168.75%)? 200% means tanks are doing like 225% more threat than dps. 75% increased by 200%=225% dps' threat..<br />
<br />
O.k. here is where the problem comes in. With righteous fury up on live if I hit for 7k holy damage I will generate 10010 threat. Which is a pretty good amount. Now here is where it gets tricky. If say a mage turns around and blasts that target for 10011 damage they have agro, or they would except for a 20% threat reduction which reduces their threat leaving them roughly 8008. Which means I still hold agro. Now what happens if say that 7k holy damage gets reduced to 6k, and ontop of that if that 10011 damage fireball from the mage gets buffed to say 15000 damage. I'm not going to say that 200% was too much, because I haven't experienced raiding in cataclysm yet. I have no idea how crazy the numbers are going to be. Still they were pretty messed up before, and were in need on tuning. When it comes to threat it is something that should be over done rather than under done. Under doing it causes wipes, which causes frustration and aggravation. Overdoing it makes things a little easy, but they can always add in a mechanic latter to wipe threat and make the tank pick it up again on mobs. They do it already with random charges etc.</div></div><hr />

I'm fine with the threat increase, seems fair if tanking was too hard. I just hope they do not make the same mistake they did in cata; and that is to cave in too much to player concerns. Players will always exaggerate concerns. Rather than finding a way around it, pushing themselves; they turn to complaining.<br />
<br />
The change is ok. But I hope blizzard has the balls to turn back the change if it turns out to be too much. The exaggerated concerns of WotLK beta, is part of what &quot;killed&quot; a lot of difficulty in it. I mean I've played a lot of classes and a lot of different roles in WotLK, and tanking when compared to vanilla and TBC was simply too easy. And that's a change that started in beta where I noticed over the builds that blizzard caved to bad tanks, that were unwilling to push themselves.<br />
Throughout WotLK they never had the balls to correct this mistake, leading to these AoE fests and weird debuffs and gimmicks. I hope they are willing to tackle the problem head on if this turn out to need further tweaking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many people are running their mouths about threat when they haven't even played on beta/PTR. Threat IS an issue here, but not to the extent that some people are making it out to be.<br />
<br />
Working decently hard to maintain good TPS should be fun. Right now, for warriors (and Pallies to some extent) I find it to be adequate (maybe slightly under where it needs to be) and fairly enjoyable. If you are losing aggro to healers right now (with 125% threat) one of two things is happening:<br />
<br />
1) Your healer is either pre-healing you or hitting you with a decent sized heal the instant you aggro the mobs.<br />
2) You're failing as a tank in one, or maybe many aspects.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, If I charge into a mob, shield slam, revenge then hit a devastate or two, one pyroblast or conflag should not pull aggro. Whoever said that tanks were doing 75% the dps that dps classes were doing (with the vengeance up) was either geared mostly in dps type gear or has reforged their gear to dps style stuff. Every decently long fight I've done on my warrior and pally (2 1/2 minutes plus) has left me at roughly 35 - 60% of the dps that my dps classes were pulling. This is fine by me, I think the numbers I'm seeing popping up now are adequate for tanks. We shouldn't be critting raid bosses for 30 - 35k. <br />
<br />
Like canbie said earlier, I feel 200% may be too high, but raising it from 125% was a good move.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Don't bother commenting on Tanking or Threat gen when you've never: A) tanked on the PTR or B) played a tank class before and think you know how it works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know what you mean, but it's invalid. This threat buff was to make up for the nerf of removing threat limiters on DPS. DPS cause more threat in 4.0.1 than they did prior. I don't know if it's 200% more, but Blizzard is still in the process of fine-tuning this. When someone says &quot;WotLK tanking,&quot; I think of chain pulling 6 or 7 groups of mobs and spamming whatever AE you can to try to keep DPS or healers from pulling any of the 35 things attacking you off. That's not ever going to come back (at least according to GC). Blizzard wants to bring back tanking to what it was in BC. In most encounters CC is NOT optional and you want to pay attention to which mob should die first.<br />
<br />
<br />
add ons like omen were made for a reason.if the fury warrior rips threat off your tank,its not automatically the tanks fault because he wasnt pulling enough threat.it could be because your warrior was just bashing away and not caring about how much threat hes pulling<br />
<br />
If Blizzard wanted DPS to hit a skill, watch Omen, wait for tank to hit shield slam again before hitting the next button in their rotation, we wouldn't have rotations in the first place. And yes, I do know Blizzard is trying to keep people from being rotation-locked, but this is different. GC has said in several posts DPS shouldn't have to ever throttle their DPS because of threat. If a Mage opens up a large pull with Flamestrike, followed up with a Blizzard, yeah, he probably deserves to die if it's the wrong kind of pull. But a Fury Warrior shouldn't pull aggro because they really should have checked Omen and waited 3 seconds before hitting Execute. :-P</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot; Immolate base damage increased by 55%.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course Conflagrate was going to be nerfed in response to this buff since it scaled 100% with immolate dmg. And if you actually look at it, it would only be 7% less dmg on conflag then on live. Letting Immolate dmg compared to live = 1.55 and the new conflag value = .60, it would work out like this :<br />
100 x 1.55 = 155, then 155 x .60 = 93<br />
<br />
So all in all, its just balancing. Beta is beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still, having spent a very substantial amount of time on the PTR, mostly doing 5mans but getting into the odd ToC when I could, I can say with confidence that something needed to be changed. <br />
<br />
I'm a well-geared Blood DK Tank (Char Summary shows avg iLvl277) and have been tanking since WotLK beta. I've seen the ups and the downs of the Class and have managed just fine.<br />
<br />
That being said, 4.0.1 (PTR) made life extremely difficult for me. It felt like I was living between Rune Strikes, paying more attention to my Runic Empowerment procs and Omen and tabbing between mobs to make sure someone didn't pull threat that I rarely if ever had an opportunity to stop and watch my surroundings... Thankfully, this was still in WotLK content and nothing I was doing was new to me. If it were new content, I'd have been completely overwhelmed. <br />
<br />
It feels very clunky to be back to where we were pre-Icy Slam buff. Running in, Death Striking or Blood Boil'ing for initial threat felt clumsy. Waiting for Rune Strike to light up and hoping for the right Rune to proc to break 4+ seconds of ability-downtime didn't feel like Tanking at all. I'd either be grasping for a threat lead or totally swimming in threat. <br />
<br />
I hope that if anyone reads this, it doesn't come across as QQ. I want balance. If this is an overbuff, I hope they tune it down. I want my rotation/abilities to be interesting enough that I keep an eye on them, but I don't feel it's appropriate to the game to make it our sole focus. After all, we're generally responsible for moving the boss for certain mechanics, swapping in-and-out, calling for DPS switches, etc.</div></div><hr />

I'm playing on the PTR with my main toon tank, and it's absolutely impossible to keep aggro from all mobs. Even if dps focus on the mob you're targetting, hunters misdirecting and rogues tricktrading, you can't sustain all their dmg.<br />
<br />
Even if you switch dmg to increase threat with other target, third or fourth mob runs towards the healer soon after.<br />

From your use of the term &quot;loldpsing&quot;, it sounds like you think that the dpsing ISN'T fun, in which case surely tanking is well on it's way to being more fun. Or are you NOT using the term &quot;loldpsing&quot; in a perjorative sense?</div></div><hr />

And also yes, i agree 100% with the ppl above that said that aoe was also a impatient dps problem, not watching their threat. There is ALWAYS a way not to get threat :P</div></div><hr />

no, it was hitting for rediculous amounts on the beta and ptr's. I've experienced. Keep in mind, spells on beta have been changed in terms of spellpower scalingmods. Before this nerf conlfag was/is more OP then it was when it hit the hardest in wotlk:P</div></div><hr />

A friend of mine always said that, &quot;The right to complain and whine, should be written into Declaration of Human Rights (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights)&quot;.

It's call &quot;clarification&quot;. It's when you make statement, but make a slight error in that statement and then someone tells you the correct information. Blue have an inside track on what going on, but expecting every single person to remember every single detail perfectly is a bit much, don't you think? He thought all emblems had been replaced with JPs, but then someone internal reminded him that they decided to keep Champion Seals.<br />

You realize that the &quot;WoW community&quot; is not some sort of hive mind, right? You have about 5-7 million people in the North America/Western Europe WoW community (which is mostly what posts here on MMOChamp, with a few people from Korea and Taiwan). Surprisingly some of them want different things from teh game than others. Some people *like* punishingly difficult games. Others never want to work at all. Most fall somewhere on a huge spectrum in between these extremes.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;lame duck session&quot; before a new expansion goes live is always a little odd and exciting. My advice is to chill a little, sit back, and watch Deathwing destroy your world. (Source) <br />
<br />
<br />
Exciting? Really? It's more akin to we know things are screwed up and the player base will just have to deal with it for an extra month or two.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is starting to ask to much of me and my gaming habit. &quot;Please pay blizzard for a 2 month screwed up gaming.&quot;<br />
<br />
So what blizzard is telling you seems to be that after months and months of the same old crap we have been running. We're now suppose to sit about month and a half with the same crap that's now going to be broken to some extent and your just suppose to sit around and watch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Live with it you dumb screws cause that's all your getting till the expansion!&quot; is what I read.<br />
<br />
If it was not for having so much time put into this game and with no other game to fill that time I'd have to drop blizzard like a bad habit. Cause what we have been doing for the last couple months and whats coming sure ain't what I initially paid to get. <br />

Don't give me that. There are so many damn games to play it's not even funny. I'm sure you could find ONE to that tickles your fancy. I suspended my account until Dec.7 for the same reasons (mainly tired of ICC). I plan to catch up on my other games that have been collecting dust in the mean time.

I've played a lock for 5 years and i think the changes so far are fine, conflag was way to strong although i do think it's non crit damage is pretty crap, even with the 40% nerf my crits are still 30k with all procs up (that just over 5300 sp self buffed).</div></div><hr />

Sad? Yes it is and still true. I just have not found a game to replace wow and Ive tried a few FPS but I can't see paying $50 + bucks for a game that you complete inside 2 weeks. I've even tried a few other MMO's but none feel like they are a long term playing game. There OK but not outstanding.<br />
<br />
However, what blizzard is now asking of me now just crossed the line in my book.<br />
<br />
blizzard is asking you to not only to continue to pay them but continue to pay them for a game they know to be screwed up in numerous ways. Might not be totally broken but if you have been on the PTR or beta at all and know what the differences are then most would come to the same conclusion I think.<br />
<br />
blizzard has now asked too much of me as a gamer. Asking me to play a screwed up game, pay them money to play the screwed up game and to do it for almost 2 additional months in the same content you have been playing for 10 months.<br />
<br />
That is simply to much. Maybe it is time for me to cancel cause I can't see me continuing to play the same old tired content with screwed up mechanics and balance issues and numerous other problems that wont get fixed till the expansion is released.<br />
<br />
I wish I had reached that &quot;quitting point&quot; like you did months back and it wouldn't even be an issue now. I finally got there so thats something.</div></div><hr />

Expecting someone to do their fcking job is wrong now? Either you are one of two people:<br />

But you said you only wanted something til Cata came out right? Well you don't need to find a new MMO then. As for the $50+, use slickdeals.net. I have a collection of like 10 games I got on there when deals popped up. None of which I paid more than $20 for. Ex. Valkyria chronicles, Bioshock 2, etc. <br />
<br />
If you don't have a console, then steam has deals allll the time. They just had one for Left 4 Dead 1 and 2 for $10. Just look the deals and quality games are out there to tide you over until Cata.</div></div><hr />

The thing is that both were big problems with Ret being overpowered in PvP. It was ridiculous to have a Ret to unload on you by popping Divine Storm's CD, CS, Judgement, DS, and finishing you off with HoW. There was no rotation for a Ret Paladin and the spec felt idiotic to play, as if you weren't doing anything but were killing everything. And it isn't fair to let them run around for ten seconds, invincible, while they decimate everything around them. Nerfs to bubbles and survivability abilities were needed to make the class less overpowered.</div></div><hr />

No, actually I go up to the window and ask them to correct the error. In this case the error was corrected before I even asked! Sweet! People make mistakes. Even at work. I make mistakes. I bet you make mistakes. It happens. He made an error, he corrected himself.

I second Steam for this. I got the entire &quot;Jedi Knight&quot; series of FPS games (From the original Dark Forces Win 3.11 game through Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy) for $40 off Steam. It downloads from their servers: no shipping, no going to the store, no muss no fuss. Sure they're oldish games, but they were tons of fun and all together probably add up up to a month or more of game play. Steam sells new stuff too (mostly Valve games, but they resell for others too), but the oldies are often really good deals.</div></div><hr />

On another note, I was expecting frost mages to get a decent nerf, ice lance hits far too hard for a spammable ability in pvp.<br />

Nope, I get my money back. I don't want you to fix it, you had your shot at my cash. Now someone else will get it. It's that simple. As for me, if I make a mistake I am expected to be held accountable for it. I will give you an example. On one of my exams the other day we were calculating something. I was .001 off the correct answer. The professor was talking to me and said &quot;it's small, but it doesn't matter if you are .001 or 1 off. The patient is still dead because you made a mistake&quot;. He's right, it's that simple. I made a mistake and I had to be responsible for it. You know what though? Next time I will make damn sure I don't make that same mistake. If you start letting people off, and don't hold them accountable at their chosen profession where does it stop? Should I expect someone else to be less accountable than myself? No, I hold every professional to the same level. Now if he wasn't a professional it would be different. If he had replied with &quot;I don't know, I will check&quot; it would be different. When you give an answer though be prepared to be held responsible for that answer. Sure this is a silly thing to call him on, but him giving that answer when he wasn't sure was just as silly.<br />

The term lame duck in this case wouldn't really apply. What I think was meant by it is that after 4.0 till cataclysm there won't be anything else. What's more we will be stuck in a area in between. The skills are balanced around 85, but we won't be able to achieve 85 till the next expansion which is over a month after 4.0 launches. So some things will feel really under powered, and some will feel really over powered.</div></div><hr />

As for paladins, holy got a nice buff and so far ret is alot more fun in pve, i mean yeah we suck at aoe but we do pretty well vs single target/boss fights, you know fights that matter. As for pvp i wont even comment since melee are pretty much boned in pvp vs casters.<br />
<br />
You mean after 5 years casters finally have the edge on melee?</div></div><hr />

Congratulations I guess... you're an asshole. If you would seriously demand your money back for a minor ordering error, then you are about my least favorite type of anal retentive. <br />
<br />
As for me, if I make a mistake I am expected to be held accountable for it.<br />
Of course you're held responsible, but there's different levels of mistakes and different levels of responsibility. In this case the poster made a slight error (in fact his overall statement was mostly correct, he just neglected this one relatively small portion of the question and he immediately corrected himself. It would be like me telling you that your local DNS information is in your /etc/host file and then coming back two minutes later and explaining that I typo-ed /etc/hosts. It's a minor error easily and quickly corrected.<br />
<br />
I will give you an example. On one of my exams the other day we were calculating something. I was .001 off the correct answer. The professor was talking to me and said &quot;it's small, but it doesn't matter if you are .001 or 1 off. The patient is still dead because you made a mistake&quot;. He's right, it's that simple. I made a mistake and I had to be responsible for it. <br />
If it's an error capable of killing the patient it's not a small error. Simple as that. The number may be small, but on the orders of magnitude you're talking about it must be a significant error. In computers I deal with the same thing. Sometimes when dealing with very large or very small numbers apparently minor errors are important. When you're dealing with that you have to be more careful than normal. Being off by .001 when you're deling with something that has a margin for error of +/- .000001 is the same as being off by a 1000 when you're dealing with something that has a margin for error of +/- 10. It's the nature of highly specialized work. On the other hand if you're talking to a patient and say, &quot;Let's try you on Metapaxamaxuim for a week... oh wait... I meant MetapaxaMINium, sorry. &quot; no one is going to sue you for malpractice it. Now if you actually wrote the prescription for the wrong drug, and the patient got sicker or didn't improve, that's something else. But then again, there are reasons that surgeons, engineers, and other people whose mistakes can cost lives are both *very* well trained, and usually have someone else competent looking over their shoulder when they are doing their most potentially dangerous work. <br />
<br />
You know what though? Next time I will make damn sure I don't make that same mistake. If you start letting people off, and don't hold them accountable at their chosen profession where does it stop? Should I expect someone else to be less accountable than myself? No, I hold every professional to the same level. Now if he wasn't a professional it would be different. If he had replied with &quot;I don't know, I will check&quot; it would be different. When you give an answer though be prepared to be held responsible for that answer. Sure this is a silly thing to call him on, but him giving that answer when he wasn't sure was just as silly.<br />
Again. People misspeak, or think they know an answer but something changed and they didn't know about it. It happens. If you go through life expecting perfection, expect to be disappointed. <br />

Here we agree. There's no answer to whether it will be harder or easier. It depends entirely on what &quot;it&quot; you're referring to. Some stuff will be OP, some UP and there's no guess which until the patch hits.</div></div><hr />

Whoa there, not all casters, Mages were always competitive in PVP, as well as Locks &quot;most&quot; of the time. Melee always should have the damage advantage to make up that they simply have to get in close to attack. They're not ranged where I sit back at a distance on my Lock or Mage and cast away, and if they get near me, I have many tools to get separation. So yes, melee should have damage on their side. Healing became really strong, and we all know how OP resto druids have been since S2, they have been the bigger offender in PVP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any information will be welcome :)<br />
<br />
What I take it to mean is cause things are balanced for 85 toons your going to see tons of balance issues. Your being asked to play a game for the next month and a half that is truely screwed up.<br />
<br />
This balance issue will not only be talent wise between toons but also encounter wise. Nothing will be balanced with each other and your being asked to just pay your money and wait it out in the hopes that the light at the end of the tunnel is bright enough to get you there.<br />
<br />
Other than a screwed up balanced game I'm sure there will be other problems with such a huge change to teh game coming but the balance problem covers so many aspects of the game it's hard to grasp just that one much less the other problems we'll be dealing with.<br />
<br />
Will it make things easier? Not very likely, no.<br />
Will it make things more difficult? Probably so.<br />
Will things not work as intended and encounters not work like they were designed to work. Yes, its going to be a headache.</div></div><hr />

As for hunters, they should be buffed but not a joke increase on trap times. While that does help some with pvp, (apparently it's hard to walk around the brightly glowing trap on the ground) I hope they buff bm more. That spec has just been horrible through wrath compared to the other two. I hope they put it at least equal.<br />

I've been playing since May 25 2005 so i know a great deal about casters ( a lot more than you)<br />
<br />
Pre BC- POM pyro mages enough said and shadow priests had a brief time in the sun<br />
<br />
BC- Locks pretty much only counter class was rogues, seduce chain spam was annyoing as hell and this was the start of frost being mages pvp spec (you got 3 years of melee qqing about frost mages)<br />
<br />
Wrath- During uld lock had a nice little few weeks of being op in pve and bgs, RPM (rouge priest mage) have been the dominate 3s team for majority of arenas life, thats 2 casters to 1 melee.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they have gotten more useful bonuses. Blood has got the damage reduction and other tanking specific ones now, as it makes more sense if you look at the specs ^^</div></div><hr />

blood is the sole tanking tree in cata, and thus blood presence is the new tanking presence</div></div><hr />

If you read the original post it is obvious that Bashiok misunderstood the question. People questioned him about it and he then asked someone and clarified it. This is one of the problems with just reading the front page of MMO Champion, you don't see the full context of the conversation. In this case I think it would have been best to not even include the first part as it wasn't accurate.</div></div><hr />

This change must have been made solely for the mentally challenged Death Knights who tank (or at least attempt to) in blood presence :P</div></div><hr />

You don't know what you're talking about so stfu, okay? They needed to change ret but this is very frustrating cause<br />
a lot of new problems appear with the changes in Cata.. and they're far away from fixing ret. (The same goes for a<br />

Once and only once was I threatened for ignoring the so-called tough guy bluster, and that chap was arrested for it. It really never is smart to throw a fit in a place frequented by cops, as for all the flexing of percieved power, the guy with the badge trumps all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baderade</div><div class="date">2010-10-13, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm confused. Bliz said tanks are doing about 75% of the damage dps are, because of vengeance...<br />
<br />
They also removed all of the threat reductions from classes and put all the different sources of threat increases into one spell(blood presence, bear form, defensive stance, righteous fury)..so...shouldn't 125% be more than enough(75% increased by 125% is 168.75%)? 200% means tanks are doing like 225% more threat than dps. 75% increased by 200%=225% dps' threat..<br />
<br />
Unless I'm really mistaken or WoW uses some very odd equation for their percentages, that was some bad math with you're percentages. 125% of 75% is not 168.75% it's 93.75% and 300% of 75% is 225%, but 200% of 75% is 150%. 150% shouldn't make tanks sweat hard to hold aggro, but at the same time the way tanks will reach that inherent 75% of damage as a dps is through a passive ability that is constantly stacking and non-linear. It won't be at it's full potential at the pull so the overthreat will allow a little time for vengeance to reach the full ap bonus for tanks. They're trying to keep tanks from generating a ton of aggro at the beginning of the fight and then being able to hold aggro while doing little in the more stable parts of the fight which is truly how the aggro system works currently. On a boss that doesn't aggro wipe of have any special multipliers on aggro there is very little trouble for a tank aggro-wise during the bulk of the fight. Only during a lot of movement or the pull when the boss is getting nuked by fully cd popped dps is aggro even a true concern for a tank in my experience. They're trying to make the game fun for people and hopefully they're succeeding with this new patch</div></div><hr />
