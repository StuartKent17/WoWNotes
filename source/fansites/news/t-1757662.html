I have to wonder if this whole Naval missions thing is just the beginning. South Seas expansion next? Grommash might be a single boss raid encounter coming in 6.3. Still part of this next new tier.<br />

<br />
One would assume that if you played the game to ANY extent in PvE you'd have a Garrison anyways. Also Blizzard said they were heavily tied to question, but not Raids and such. So you can still raid or PvP just not Quest.<br />
<br />
Either way, 6.2 looks good so far, Mythic Dungeons sound amazing to me. FINALLY some good 5 man content.<br />
<br />
Those Monk Nerfs though, Holy crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you not hear at Blizzcon? It's not an orc and he's not the guy, &quot;There's a guy behind a guy.&quot; Archimonde is a great choice and should keep it that way.:)<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
&quot;Hellfire Citadel stands at the heart of Tanaan Jungle, where 13 deadly bosses await you, including Kilrogg Deadeye, the monstrous Gorefiend, a reanimated Mannoroth, and Archimonde himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, looks like that explains that Teron'gor AND Mannoroth will get resurrected. This is going to be good!</div></div><hr />

There is no mention of final boss, they just listed some of the bosses in the raid where Archimonde was mentioned last.</div></div><hr />

Some of these changes are crazy, 30% damage reduction to many WW abilities but power shifted back into tigereye brew, 25% damage reduction to demo lock abilities, 10% nerf to Spriest mastery for some reason, what seems like ST buffs to sub rogues which are already pretty strong, no buffs to enhancement, nerfs to elemental, nerfs to ret, nerfs to arcane, zero nerfs to fire mage.<br />
<br />
Seems like they're rebalancing most classes to do less damage overall instead of bringing lower specs up to par but some of them are just odd. Spriest mastery nerf is silly since this is primarily ST of which Spriest ST is one of the worst whereas our multi-target is insane.<br />
<br />
Some of these just don't make sense. Interesting to see what changes will be made over the next month or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogues are under performing in BRF so i understand those changes. But remember when they start doing mastery changes it probably has to do with scaling and what will happen with full 6.2 gear. In their testing without the nerf, shadow might go nuts at a certain mastery number.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It'll just be more Orc/Human wank and be little more than scenarios being re-introduced under a new name.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redecle</div><div class="date">2015-04-14, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol reanimated Mannoroth.. What a joke. Well it was either that or Magtheridon. That was just so foreseeable.<br />
Archimonde okayyyy.... Guess he won't be penultimate boss to Sargeras with Kil'jaeden then. Fail.<br />
<br />
Gorefiend and Kilrogg well they were already like confirmed since they are still alive, but no mention of Gul'dan so we can finally assume he escapes and heads to Azeroth. Nailed it.<br />
<br />
Naval missions, i don't know. Not too excited that Blizzard is still milking the garrisons even though their current stage.<br />
<br />
New questing zone, well at least that's nice, even though that was already known to be coming.<br />
<br />
Mythic dungeons, AWESOME. Finally. 5mans are back! Shame thoiu it's only WoD 5mans but it's a start. And no new ones? WHY? God damn lazy..<br />
<br />
Biggest dev team ever my ass. Outsourced graphical side my ass. Making one raid cannot possibly take so many resources, Tanaan didn't make 6.0 but i would assume it was at least half done by then and then 2 patches time to complete it. Is the dev team only working on the next expac or what? WoD was just left as a failure to fall in it's own pit?<br />
<br />
Frost DKs buffed? What? NO.<br />
<br />
Guardian get a buff, that's good.<br />
Feral gets a BUFF? WHAT?!? WHY? HOW? Does Blizzard have any clue what's going on in the pvp side of their game? Stop this shit. This is like the arms warriors all over again..<br />
<br />
Hunters get a nerf, about god damn time.<br />
<br />
Mages...<br />
<br />
Monk changes mmkay.. Don't know if brewmasters deserve a buff thou..<br />
<br />
Paladins, retri nerf seems okay too.<br />
<br />
Priests, guess they okay then.<br />
<br />
Rogues, okay combat is out of the window in pvp now, well that lasted 2 patches. Assassination is back, not too excited about that.<br />
<br />
Shamans are okay.<br />
<br />
Warlocks, no idea, since i mostly play destro.<br />
<br />
Warriors get nothing?? Really? So Bliz you made a new spec of gladiator and it was used for one patch and then thrown out? What, Why?<br />
So arms all the way in pvp and multi target pve? Booooooooring! Sole reason i nearly rerolled my main to warrior was gladiator and it was added for nothing, guess i'm glad i stayed on the rogue as main.<br />
<br />
*edit* gladiator stance has gotten 30% buff to gain 30% mastery, that's something, finally.<br />
<br />
So from 6.1 Blizzard learned to retune 5mans not much else.. New raid but well that's kind of given. New zone, well that zone could have been shipped with 6.0.. We'll have to wait and see how the questing there is, if it's just a bunch of dailies, all hope is lost.<br />
No info on flying? Garrisons already dismantled any possible world pvp so what the hell are you waiting for?<br />
<br />
Positive thing is that I can still keep going with my catch up on old content and try to get 100% completion on everything before WoD, if this is all WoD offers. Do Tanaan questing once, complete CMs and Mythic 5mans, complete legendary ring and clear Hellfire at least once, WoD done apparently. Oh and acquire Rukhmar mount, only thing that's gonna be done past WoD.</div></div><hr />

Confirmed there is at this point. No Grom and no Gul'dan in this raid. Either they are a boss in the next expansion, or we are getting a third tier. I suppose blizz gave up on the &quot;Lets do faster expansions&quot; idea.</div></div><hr />

From the Adventurers Journal<br />
<br />
Hellfire Citadel<br />
<br />
Loot ilvls:<br />
Normal - 695<br />
Heroic - 710<br />
Mythic - 725<br />
<br />
LFR loot is not in yet and will probably be around 680-685. Mythic Dungeons loot from non-end bosses will be pretty close to LFR. The 700 ilvl drops will beat LFR by a good bit.<br />
<br />
On side note: 5 LFR wings. Will take a while to completely open.</div></div><hr />

Lol you must have been out of the loop for a long time, pretty much everyone knew that there was more than likely only going to be 2 tiers this time around the price of the xpac should not have been what it was but ah well..</div></div><hr />

Problem with that being, Blizzcon is in November. That leaves a REALLY long gap where there would be no announcements, and then suddenly everything all at once between November and December. (Assuming they're aiming to keep that promise of shorter end of expansion lulls.)</div></div><hr />

In fact, I think I hate them, to be blunt. They're going to put too much emphasis on burst + RNG, and are going to cause any given attempt to vary wildly based on who receives the god buff at the proper point in their burst. Kills at the very high-end could end up amounting to just getting an awesome pull where you have the buff bounce to the exact right people in the exact right order to account for different classes having different ramp-up times and burst windows.<br />
<br />
There needs to be randomness involved in the game, yes, but the amount of randomness that sounds like is not going to be fun. And that's assuming that they've made certain it'll be a rotating selection, rather than truly random selection.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They won't because not that many people are going to be able to get into these dungeons, if they did not bother to do the Proving Grounds to do heroics, they sure as hell are not going to bother to do the same dungeons although at a different difficulty. Current heroic have a long enough queue to get into them and for the most part are worthless after starting the ring chain and inn/tavern quest. These Mystic will probably be done by those that already do brawler's guild and CM's and people that raid, that will be about it. I wonder now that they are making this difficulty they are going to remove the PG requirement for heroics? Which would make sense, but they would still be worthless to run at heroic level with no real reason to run them.</div></div><hr />

Actually, they said there would be only two tiers... with a possible filler (more like ruby sanctum, less like sunwell and totally not T19) if it would take too long to launch the next xpac.<br />
<br />
By the looks of all the re-used stuff, they seem to be going all out with the next xpac in time for blizzcon 2015.<br />

Your comment also makes no sense even for pvp... altough Ferals are really OP in pvp, Frost DK's are far from that &quot;best dmg&quot;. They're average at best in pvp, exactly because there are many other classes/specs &quot;extremely crazy right now&quot; like ferals.<br />
<br />
DKs only have dmg as frost, nothing else, and that dmg is kinda outdated as of now.</div></div><hr />

The buff gets stronger for each ring wearer, but a given person gets the buff less often if i got it right (5 intel band wearer, so 12sec every 60sec of 50% bonus damage)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redecle</div><div class="date">2015-04-14, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Them tier sets, who is responsible for this garbage?<br />
By now i'm used to it that rogue sets are pure a grade dudu, but the rest seems to be going the same way..<br />
Seriously this shit is like the work of fashion designers that you see models wearing while walking on the runway, things that no normal people would ever fuckin wear outside or even in their own home, cause it makes them look like you've spent your last night in the bar and vomited on yourself in the alley next to the bar and then passed out in your bathroom hugging the toilet.<br />
Next expansion better be pretty a class for the costume designers to save face.<br />
More class specific tier sets please and far less gimp spacesuits.<br />
<br />
And of course the only other cool mount in the expansion, other being the solarhawk is going to be mythic final boss drop that when regular people will get their hands on it will be 1% drop.<br />
Thanks, subbing for the next 10 years because of mounts, cause apparently making any other reasonable content is not an option and mounts that have had their capability to fly in current content removed with no sight of coming back.<br />
<br />
And those legendary ring procs, what the actual fuck? group and main stat based procs.. How original.. That synergy.. Class stacking much..<br />
<br />
When they released that we would be going to Draenor, i was there saying i'm out among the first, Outland was shit and this will be too. Did that unsubbed when Pandaria was done, with no intention to never return. Then they sucked you back in with awesome first impressions and promises. And even up till 6.2 i defended them again. To now find myself regretting breaking the first decision i made in the matter. And this is because of decisions like the feral druid above, a class whose already op bloody DOTs kill you faster from 100%-&gt;0% than warriors instant cast Execute can kill you from 20%-&gt;0%. Yes that's an overreaction, but that's how it feels when DOT that shoud be slow kills kill you faster than instant cast finishers.</div></div><hr />

Again no more dungeons (like the ICC type of content raid+dungeons was really great)<br />
No new PVP content AT ALL, not even when the pvp community is so mad/dead right now, they don't even care.<br />
More garrison shit.<br />
Boring.<br />
<br />
A new ashran related map right in front page and you say no new pvp content at all?<br />
<br />
PVP is actually bound to don't have much new content in fact. PVP &quot;new mobs&quot; would be new races/classes/players. New gear happens (since wow players have taken on that fact that new gear = new content). The only thing left would be BG/Arena maps. BGs that most pvp players don't care and arenas that are basically the same since they can't have objectives/new mechanics other than LoS pillar stuff to people go crazy running around.<br />
<br />
In the end, even PvE don't get new maps, since all this tanaan stuff was alread there. They just finish the instanced map stuff that doesn't require extensive testing to not let any unfair advantage for the other team in pvp, since it's not pvp.<br />
<br />
New maps for pvp, only with new xpacs, just like most of the pve stuff.</div></div><hr />

Your comment also makes no sense even for pvp... altough Ferals are really OP in pvp, Frost DK's are far from that &quot;best dmg&quot;. They're average at best in pvp, exactly because there are many other classes/specs &quot;extremely crazy right now&quot; like ferals.<br />
<br />
DKs only have dmg as frost, nothing else, and that dmg is kinda outdated as of now.<br />
<br />
They have high uptime because they have three ways to get out of any CC. <br />
<br />
I'm probably just bitter because Frost DK/Healer seems to hard counter double dps and that's what I play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They only have high uptime if you let them or you're totally out of anything to use (or you're just another Frost DK). And they can't get out of ANY cc in 3 times whenever they feel like doing it...<br />
<br />
They have one the worst mobility in the game, the &quot;alway crits&quot; is totally rng (since it's a proc) and the rest of their dmg outside of the obliterate crits is really poor. To the point that even unholy DKs started to see some light in this xpac as viable dk dps spec for pvp (really, most of the stuff are talents that all 3 specs can have).<br />
<br />
Any burst DPS/Healer can hard counter that basically. Before you go nuts with the Frost DK/Healer that beat you in the last x2 arena (that was never meant to be balanced), you should go crazy with all the other dps/healer combos that will shut you down even faster.<br />
<br />
That's why they're actually buffing Frost DKs. DK is an outdated class, frost is an outdated spec compared to blood/unholy and the spec itself is totally outdated inside the xpac itself compared to 6.0 and the begining of the xpac (where they even nerfed it knowing that the spec was in a really bad shape/position for the near future).</div></div><hr />

Think folks are going by what Blizz said last year in that they were aiming for a 2 tier xpac this time, maybe 3 if the next xpac takes longer than forecast (will wait n see on that bit)..</div></div><hr />

It is rumored, not confirmed as far as I know.<br />

It sure fits with the theme of the patch and the fact that you will be completing your legendary ring.<br />

Well I remind you that WoD came out in November. I know they said they wanted shorter xpac cycles but that seems way too short to me.<br />
<br />
Come release of this patch you can assume we'll be in early june or later. Give that patch 3 or 4 months and we're up to a year.<br />
Not unrealistic if they want to hit that projection.</div></div><hr />

They will probably be releasing Citidel in wings like they do with every other end game raid if that is the case. That should take us into the fall by the time the last boss is available. So lets assume all HC is out in October. that is still a month before Blizzcon where the next expansion will no doubt be announced. Even if that xpac comes out next summer, that would mean 6.2's content would have to tide us over from June until the next summer. Does that seem likely to you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
October, what ?<br />
<br />
6.2 wont be out until mid July. I mean the notes have just been made public, to say nothing for the extensive raid testing they need to do on PTR. By the time patch goes live, Citidel will prob not be available right away, making us do the quests to open up the zone. Here is my best guess at release schedule going by past Blizzard history:<br />
<br />
Mid July: 6.2 is released<br />
First week of August: first wing in Hellfire is released - 4 bosses<br />
2 weeks later: second wing - 4 bosses, 8 total<br />
2 weeks later: last wing = 4 bosses, 12 total<br />
1 week after: end boss of Citidel, 13 total<br />
<br />
So thats either late September or early October.</div></div><hr />

It's confirmed now. The legendary rings, much like cloaks in MoP, are intended to take the entire expansion to complete. Once you complete your legendary you know you're in the final content patch of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oriana</div><div class="date">2015-04-14, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't really like the look of those ring effects. In fact, I think I hate them, to be blunt. They're going to put too much emphasis on burst + RNG, and are going to cause any given attempt to vary wildly based on who receives the god buff at the proper point in their burst. Kills at the very high-end could end up amounting to just getting an awesome pull where you have the buff bounce to the exact right people in the exact right order to account for different classes having different ramp-up times and burst windows.<br />
<br />
There needs to be randomness involved in the game, yes, but the amount of randomness that sounds like is not going to be fun. And that's assuming that they've made certain it'll be a rotating selection, rather than truly random selection.<br />
<br />
100% agree<br />
<br />
The idea of effect sounds fun at first. Maybe they can remove randomness and provide us with an extra action button which will allow to pass the buff. Some sort of debuff may be added to avoid having the buff on one person all the time. The duration of debuff should depend on the number of wearers of the ring of that kind.</div></div><hr />

Not Exactly, as Gul'dan will not appear in the Raid, maybe there will be one more patch to tell us what he is up to, and to continue the storyline from who told Gul'dan about Khagdar, and the next patch leading us directly into the next expansion (remember folks, they talked about this expansion being close tied with the next one).</div></div><hr />

I know they've mentioned numerous times they want to make dungeons an important aspect of WoW again and have dungeons implemented beyond the initial launch ones. <br />
<br />
http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/11499600/warlords-of-draenor-dungeons-and-raids-11-9-2013<br />
<br />
<br />
We’re also planning our content schedule to include additional max-level Heroic dungeons beyond the initial expansion release. One thing we heard from players during Mists of Pandaria was that they missed having new dungeon content later in the expansion, and our plan is to get back to that and adding new dungeon content beyond the initial expansion release.<br />
<br />
Sure, that is 2 years old roughly and that it was written &quot;plan to&quot; (yes I realize that &quot;plan to&quot; and &quot;are going to&quot; are two different balls of wax) but there have also been other interviews stating the desire to add more dungeons. So yes, they have mentioned doing this. Of course that could also be taken as saying &quot;new dungeon content doesn't mean new dungeons&quot;, but it is heavily implied. But the PTR just came up and perhaps I jumped the gun a bit and maybe a new dungeon or two just hasn't been ready to be added yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryphoon</div><div class="date">2015-04-14, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What a patch. As a SV Hunter main, this patch gives me:<br />
<br />
* Removal of my only raid CD<br />
* Reduced AoE by 30-50% (estimated) and no AoE burst (on-use multistrike trinket and Multi-shot for Serpent Sting procs)<br />
* Reduces my single target damage by up to 15% (Lower Explosive Shot, no Serpent Sting on Arcane Shots and their multistrikes)<br />
* Boosting a stat which is crap to begin with (mastery, which would need a 25% increase to match close to our 2nd best stat being crit/vers). This still won't make it worth getting over Crit nor Versatility.<br />
* Further increases the gap between BM and SV single target damage AND AoE making SV shit (there's not a single reason I can find to play this spec with these changes).<br />
<br />
I thought I would switch to my Mage at the start of WoD since SV was even under Holy Priest dps. Thankfully Blizz realised how stupid they were and fixed it. Now though, since I hate BM with a passion and MM is a snoozefest it looks like after 8 years I will no longer be a Hunter.<br />

I dont care if i turn into a giant phallus, as long as I get a substantial buff. I dislike sharing my hard earned legendary though. Then I got to the tier sets, and looked at my hunter tier.<br />
<br />
I am sorry but T17 hunter mythic looked bad enough as is and was re-hashed from offset gear from Mythic Highmaul where other classes got completely new looks.... How is this even a set? I could see this &quot;Mythic&quot; set for mythic dungeons or even LFR set, but T18 mythic Citadel gear? Really? This looks like rejected sha-touched gear from a MoP dungeon set. Thank god they implemented transmog, there hasnt been a set I willingly wanted to wear since T14 Heroic.<br />
<br />
I am not going to complain about the BM/MM buffs, but why was SV nerfed? Maybe the scaling with the 73x gear, or the arcane shots / serpent sting will compensate... but I expected BM/MM to be nerfed and sv buffed to make dps equal amongst the three. SV is my favourite... Im forced into BM right now with tier bonuses (still love it), but I'd give anything to go back to SV.<br />
<br />
Please get some better looking tier for 90% of the classes.. Paladin and rogue look pretty cool.</div></div><hr />

I'd say the outliers are Paladin (controversial, I'm sure, but it does look good. Just might not be your style) and Warlock, which is pretty dang nifty.<br />
<br />
About the only weapon that looks halfway decent is the rehashed BC staff.<br />
I think it's pretty telling that the majority of xmogs I see (and that I use, myself) are BC/Wrath-era gear.<br />
Can we be done with &quot;Savage&quot; looking gear? Please? We've had this crap since Cata.<br />
Please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are buffing BM which is the strongest Hunter spec in the game, while nerfing the one that is lowest, completely butchering it's AoE in the process. Fire mages and BM Hunters are supreme with these changes.<br />
<br />
So you don't get nearly close as what you want. Sorry to bust your bubble.</div></div><hr />

Stockholm Syndrome.<br />
<br />
But yeah, you've actually got a decent point there. Whether or not our criticism on twitter/forums/etc is taken back to dev meetings (likely?), the public response from devs/cms is typically very rude, derisive, or patronizing (LOOKING AT YOU, HOLINKA.)<br />
<br />
I disagree that a lot of this wasn't fun or good the first time--BC was great, despite class imbalances, horrible raiding structure/attunements, etc. And I'd argue that BC/Wrath had the best looking gear to date.<br />
<br />
I agree that it's sorely disappointing how much of it is rehashed. Seriously. There's a ton of great lore we haven't tapped into yet. <br />
<br />
Was telling my guildies this AM that I'm leaning toward ranking this expac below Cata for a lot of reasons. Something I never thought I'd say.</div></div><hr />

We never fought Mannoroth in WoW. The pit lord in BC was Magtheridon. I think they're both reasonable, given they were both killed in WC3 and this is a good opportunity to bring them back. Personally I've been hoping for Medivh to pop up but it doesn't seem likely now.</div></div><hr />

Mannoroth is the last boss of The Well of Eternity 5 man. So this will be killed #2, just like Onyxia was &quot;reanimated&quot; and Nefarian.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also no flying but treasures we get with1 the first day? learn from the past plz blizzard.<br />
Ship missions rolf... i am pretty sure we are phased.<br />
<br />
Owell atleast we get daily quests back and those mystic dungeon are going to fail aswell. I mean are we actually going to create another difficulty level really?<br />
Soon we got 10 difficlty levels what will split the community in 10 in my opinion that is no improvement. I rather see them remove difficulty levels instead of keep adding them.<br />
<br />
And if they make mystic dungeon they better scale item ilvl to an pre-set level otherwise in a few weeks they again get a push over because ppl outgear them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly this is not a new idea but for those that do not like LFR Don't do it, don't even look at it. Taking features away from others will not make people like the same things, they most likely will leave.</div></div><hr />

Mannoroth wasn't actually killed, just banished. There's their loophole for bringing him back.</div></div><hr />

Just seems extremely lazy. They'd rather let you tweet from in-game or take selfies, than actually make new and engaging things to do and look at. It's supposed to draw you into a different world, not be another social media app. The community should sincerely demand more bang for their buck. They only post the positive feedback, unless they make a witty comeback that makes them look good. Then the negative feedback is posted and the OP is flamed.</div></div><hr />
