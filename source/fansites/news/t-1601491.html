Battle.Net Launcher Update - Warcraft III<br />
A recent update to the Battle.Net launcher added a background and icons for Warcraft III, just like the ones that currently exist for other games. No support for the game was added yet, but keep in mind that at Blizzcon 2013 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3545-World-of-Warcraft-Q-A) it was mentioned that people were working on a side project to update the old Warcraft games to run on modern versions of Windows.<br />
<br />
If you already have the game, don't forget to attach (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/wc3TFT.jpg) your CD key to your Battle.Net account.<br />
<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Upcoming Beta Build<br />
Another beta build is on the way! Check back later for notes.<br />
The Beta realms will be shutting down for maintenance in a few minutes in order to deploy a new build. I'll be updating this thread with information and time estimates as I receive them. I don't have an ETA yet, but these pushes usually take at least 8 hours, if not more.<br />
<br />
No character wipe is planned today.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor - Bonus Rolls<br />
Today we are taking a look at some of the ways to earn bonus rolls in Warlords of Draenor. <br />
<br />
With Patch 6.0.2 only a couple weeks away, don't forget to start collecting some Lesser Charms (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/738-lesser-charm-of-good-fortune) for item upgrades or uncapped turn ins for Siege of Orgrimmar bonus rolls (Warforged Seal) if you still need them. You can find other Patch 6.0 reminders in our previous post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4315-Patch-6-0-Reminders-Warlords-of-Draenor-Healing-Blue-Tweets-DLC-457).<br />
<br />
We looked at the first way recently (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4363-Garrisons-Bunker-War-Mill-Soloing-Old-Content-Blue-Tweets-ESL-Finals-DLC-458) with the Bunker / War Mill (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/8-dwarven-bunker) perk that grants you a free bonus roll every week, but there are a few other ways to earn rolls. <br />
<br />
The second method of earning bonus rolls is the two rare garrison missions that reward them. Keep in mind these are Rare missions, so you won't see them constantly. Rukhmar (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/missions/359-rukhmar) and Drov the Ruiner (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/missions/358-drov-the-ruiner) both reward one Seal of Tempered Fate (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/994-seal-of-tempered-fate).<br />
<br />
The third method to earn bonus rolls are turn in quests. The second and third time you use a certain method in a week it will cost double of what it did the last time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Apexis Crystal (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/823-apexis-crystal) (1000 (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/36055-sealing-fate-apexis-crystals) / 2000 (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/37452-sealing-fate-heap-of-apexis-crystals) / 4000) - Players can earn at 1000 per day through a type of daily quest in your garrison, another 1000 from an Ashran daily quest (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/36698-battle-in-ashran), along with some from work orders and other sources. These are also used to purchase armor that is upgradeable to item level 655 (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/823-apexis-crystal#related:currency-for;_!), which is the same as Normal level raid loot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
Gold (500 (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/36054-sealing-fate-gold) / 1000 (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/37454-sealing-fate-piles-of-gold) / 2000 (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/37455-sealing-fate-immense-fortune-of-gold)) - Keep in mind that gold is somewhat easier to earn in Warlords of Draenor, as it is taking the role of Valor (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/333951-seal-of-tempered-fate-acquisition/#post4).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
Garrison Resources (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/824-garrison-resources) (300 (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/36056-sealing-fate-garrison-resources) / 600 (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/37456-sealing-fate-stockpiled-garrison-resources) / 1200 (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/37457-sealing-fate-tremendous-garrison-resources)) - There are many sources of Garrison Resources. Your garrison gives you some every day, missions (beta.wowdb.com/currencies/824-garrison-resources#related:rewarded-from-mission;_!) can reward some, the Lumber Mill (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/40-lumber-mill) can provide some, and there are many other sources. After your buildings are built and upgraded, you may have spare Garrison Resources that can be used for these quests or converted into Trade Goods (beta.wowdb.com/currencies/824-garrison-resources?rewarded-from-page=8#related:currency-for;_!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
Honor Points (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/392-honor-points#related:rewarded-from) (500 (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/36057-sealing-fate-honor) / 1000 (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/37458-sealing-fate-extended-honor) / 2000 (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/37459-sealing-fate-monumental-honor)) - Along with all of the old sources of Honor, Ashran and other PvP activities provide several new opportunities to earn Honor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Treasure Room Achievement Becoming a Feat of Strength<br />
You can find this change, along with others in our Patch 6.0 Reminders post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4315-Patch-6-0-Reminders-Warlords-of-Draenor-Healing-Blue-Tweets-DLC-457).<br />
In WoW Patch 6.0.2, we will be retiring the Achievement In The Hall Of The Thunder King (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/8106-in-the-hall-of-the-thunder-king), as the treasure room will no longer be accessible. That achievement will become a Feat of Strength, and Elder Charm of Good Fortune (http://beta.wowdb.com/currencies/697-elder-charm-of-good-fortune) will drop in place of the key to the room.<br />
<br />
can I ask why its being removed? I loved going through there on different toons! Just depressing seeing more things removed<br />
the gold generation is really high once you can one-shot all the creatures inside<br />
There's hardly crazy amounts of gold to be had there, though. Especially if gold is the &quot;new Valor points&quot; in Warlords<br />
over 500 gold reliably once a week for minimal effort is significant<br />
But it's been that way for nearly two years - why does it matter now?<br />
at 100 the NPCs that do all the trappings are very easily killed, negating a lot of the challenge, esp in the last room (Source (https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/517049230054002688))<br />
notice could have been better though. i stopped farming keys on notion they weren’t going anywhere.<br />
there is no reward exclusive to the treasure room unlike CMs or PVP seasons. (Source (https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/517039848771702784))<br />
Will the achievement be removed from the Isle of Thunder Meta? <br />
yep, the treasure room achievements will go legacy &amp; removed from meta. (Source (https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/517034868786479104))<br />
Where will we get Elder Charms from then? The treasure run is the only source.<br />
we'll add a conversion elsewhere.<br />
Will the IoT vendors still sell items that help you in the treasure run?<br />
yes, only the key drops are being removed. if you have find a key on an alt in 6 months you can still do the treasure room. (Source (https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/517035915055599616))<br />
However could we possibly as a suggestion see another version in a future patch maybe?<br />
we would really love to do another one (Source (https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/517035717814276096))<br />

is the T17 WW 4-piece's Forceful Wind additive or multiplicative? 10 stacks = 30% + 10% (40%) or 30% * 1.1 (33%)<br />
Mult. We buffed it a bit recently, to 3%/stack. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/515273606696153088))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
WoD World bosses, spawn time = current mop or mop launch? Rukhmar drops mount, would hate Mop-launch Galleon times<br />
More like Sha of Anger. No plans on doing the Galleon/Oondasta-style respawn in the near future. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/515138671368888320))<br />
<br />
CM Titles permanent in WoD? Seems best Gold time is a feat whether the first, or 3 tiers later. Or, 1 for current, 1 permanent?<br />
No permanent title for best time in Warlords; if you want to keep the title, defend it. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/515139179173265408))<br />
<br />
Are 30-player normal/heroic raids still planned for WoD?<br />
Siege of Orgrimmar and all Warlords raids support raid sizes up to 30 on Normal/Heroic in 6.0, yes. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/515140270795415552))<br />
<br />
100% looms in 6.0 is it per toon or player? If i have normal bow now if i do mythic in 6.0 will it be 100%?<br />
Per character, per difficulty, so yes. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/515140610630488064))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Can we get some spec balance with queueing 3v3 skirmishes? Im tired of getting my dps getting paired with 2 more, into a healer/dps<br />
Just a matter of who's queuing (I.e. not enough healers). Alternative is DPS always have to wait. Prefer skirmishes be very fast. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/514972043570188288))<br />
<br />
Curious, how viable would it be to gear for PvP entirely through Ashran?<br />
For honor, probably comparable time to bgs. For conquest, possible but slow when compared to arenas/RBGs. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/515274836742926336))<br />
<br />
Did you look into this? Any update?<br />
I believe a 15-19 bracket is setup on beta/PTR. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/515275089747513344))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
You know, those healer and tank dummies that are in Shattarah on beta would be very nice in the garrison.<br />
I thought the sparring arena had a healer/tank one, that incorrect? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/514928813306675200))<br />
<br />
Hi, i would like to know if you have the profession from the garrison building, you can have more than 1 daily cooldown.<br />
The building has its own c/d, and you have your personal one, so you get both! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/514928961407557632))<br />
<br />
Since lvl 1 Dwarven Bunker doubles chance of quest rewards to rare / epic. Does it also affect followers gained from quests? <br />
It does not, they're not really considered an item, we'll take a look at adding this at some point (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/514976077241126912))<br />
<br />
Meaning say without Barracks you can have a max 7 missions to do, and scouting would make it 8 total at one point. Or stay 7?<br />
Looks like they are indeed in their own pools (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/515237374683406336))</div></div><hr />

These are also used to purchase armor that is upgradeable to item level 655, which is the same as Normal level raid loot.<br />

Gold (500 / 1000 / 2000) - Keep in mind that gold is somewhat easier to earn in Warlords of Draenor, as it is taking the role of Valor.<br />
<br />
Garrison Resources (300 / 600 / 1200) - There are many sources of Garrison Resources. Your garrison gives you some every day, missions can reward some, the Lumber Mill can provide some, and there are many other sources.

<br />
Honor Points (500 / 1000 / 2000) - Along with all of the old sources of Honor, Ashran and other PvP activities provide several new opportunities to earn Honor.<br />
<br />
Does this mean we will need to do the Ashran daily in order to get the maximum amount of Apexis Crystals per day, which is needed for PvE gear?<br />
<br />
And how does that exactly work with bonus rolls, there are four different currencies, but I can only get three bonus rolls per week?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because, ironically enough, WC2 isn't supported by Battle.net. (Well, not by 2.0 anyways.)<br />
<br />
You can check which games are avaliable (both for purchase, and redeeming by key) in the &quot;buy games&quot; section of Battle.net.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That isn't the point at all about the complaining. The points are: it is yet another piece of content Blizzard is removing; it is yet another out-of-the-blue announcement regarding content that players assumed (with history backing them up) would remain intact; it is the disregard with which the removal was announce (seriously, take a look at the content of CM Kaivax's post and see how much additional needed info wasn't included); it is the lack of educating players as to the removal (we all know Blizz has the tech to restrict things to a certain player level, or scale gear level, or adjust the amount of gold that drops...).</div></div><hr />

For the time spent hiking all the way out to Isle of Thunder and farming up a key each week you could farm pretty much any resource and make just as much. Removing the achievement makes sense, but that's a pretty lame excuse to take out the scenario.<br />
<br />
Edit: Actually I take it back. Plenty of achievements become trivial once the next expansion comes out. That they are even touching Troves at all is such a waste of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest, I don't care about the achievement, but I do care that it, and the whole scenario apparently, is being removed. Why do that? It bothers me even more so with the legendary questline. Here is a piece of content they worked at putting into the game and now they are removing it. I guess they want to make it feel as if it's more special now, it was only a limited time thing, and we are now supposed to feel special because we experienced it, but it's really stupid in my opinion. Same goes for the thing with the Vale. They removed almost all of the content in that zone.</div></div><hr />

And how does that exactly work with bonus rolls, there are four different currencies, but I can only get three bonus rolls per week?<br />
<br />
No, the Ashran daily is just one source of Apexis Crystals. There are garrison quests that reward them, and most level 100+ enemies drop them.<br />
<br />
And yes, you can only obtain three seals per week. You just get to choose how you obtain them.</div></div><hr />

I am sad however at the removal of troves, and none of the blizzard replies says anything about lowering the gold you can make and not removing the scenario... I'm also already 1shotting mobs there.<br />

I agree, they should have just reduced the gold by something like 7% per level above 90. <br />

90-100% gold<br />
91- 93% gold<br />

I can't speak for anyone else, but personally, I was busy doing work on all of the other feature-removals that Blizzard actually bothered to give reasonable warnings for. The 5.3 content, farming the ludicrous amounts of gold to buy H Garrosh and CM carries, doing Brawler's Guild, etc.</div></div><hr />

Thats like an average of 1 655 piece per month. Incredibly slow. 1 every 2 weeks would be better. Either reduce the costs in half, or double cyrstals gained. <br />

From what I've read, you get two random dailies in your garrison, which you can pick one of to do. Normal ones reward 800 crystals, group ones reward 1000, and the Ashran one rewards 1000. So you can either get 800 or 1000 per day depending on which random quests you're assigned.</div></div><hr />

That sucks. Wish you could do either, but I guess it makes sense. Pve heroes would complain they are forced to do pvp if it was both. 30-40 days for a 655 piece is unacceptable. 670 would be reasonable for over a month. They will end up nerfing that after they lose 500k subs in a quarter.</div></div><hr />

over 500 gold reliably once a week for minimal effort is significant<br />

<br />
Seriously, I can make 500g just doing dailies and they are worried about one weekly run through the troves. Hell can sell one item of the AH or got to the lower levels zones and more than 500g from archaeology. There has to be more than making 500 measly gold for them to remove this feature. It is hardly on the level of the CM's. I can't say I have had a need to go on there since I do not no longer need the coins that drop from there and since lesser charms drop like flies on TI, not really need to go in there to farm those. I was going to get around to trying to finish it to get the achievement, but I got to much other stuff I am trying to clean up that I always save to do at the end of the expansion to past the time away. This was not something that was high on the priority list of thing to get done, oh well live and learn.<br />

There are a lot more hidden gems they are not talking about and it will be interesting to see and read the reactions of many. I think they are going to find they went way to far with all this gating crap this time around. The MoP dailies pale in comparison to what this garrison and few other places have in store for many. The overwhelming amount of mats that are required to make something through the profession and the garrison profession. The endless amount of farming that is going to be required and not enough resource for enough people to actually farm at a decent rate. Some people are just going to tell Blizzard to pack it after what they had to deal with doing all the dailies in MoP. <br />
<br />
They were right they did not put a lot of dailies in WoD, but they replaced those with as much garbage as possible to slow the rate of progression through the content as much as possible. I enjoy playing this game, but I am seriously getting tired of all this unnecessary gating they seem to want to do. It just drag out the slow drip part to really not make it that fun to play. I realize it was much worse back in the day, but we left that part of the game behind along time ago and now it seems we have traded dailies for even more crappy was to gating progressing through the content. <br />
<br />
I think they are going to need to have a massive lose of people to really change their ways, unless they are happy with loosing people so they don't have to create as much content in the future. Not sure why they still make expansions, this actually feels more like a fare size content patch more than it does and expansion for all the unnecessary garbage they put in it.<br />
<br />
The closer they get to launch and the more that continues to not still be fixed in beta, just screams a lot of bugs at launch. I pre-ordered, but now I am wondering after all these years, if I really want to bother wasting more of my life playing the endless time sink game. For as nice as the surface of the content is, the underbelly is just so displeasing and very depressing that they found a worse way than dailies to come up with to further limit ones ability to go through the content without having to jump through endless hoops.</div></div><hr />

LoL, what on earth is everyone so upset about.. it's not even fun / important / useful. Who cares. It also does not take a lot time to remove it. They just stop droprate on keys.

Really? There is 2 guides out that show you how to get every chest and kill the bosses needed. You just need the items off the vendor which are super easy to buy. After 2 years you don't think it gets old? I'm 100% confident people left it to the last minute and are crying now. Or they have done it when it was relevant when you're suppose to and don't care anymore. <br />
<br />
The rewards will be borderline useless, the gold reward is low. there is no strategy to it anymore, and it would feel dated. Don't even try to tell me with everything in WoD people would go back and do weekly chest runs. That's just not happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I got one more key than treasure chests available in my last run(granted it was the luckiest one so far). I didn't get less than 5 keys in any of my last 20 runs or so. It always nets me around 600gold so I like to use it for gold farming. On the other hand you need to fly there, get the key(it's not like you always get it right away)...so overall I'd say it's 600g for 15 minutes of work. That is nice but not really great(I mean on timeless isle you get almost 50g for a 10 second daily...getting there with the port-item takes about a minute. That ain't much different when it comes to rewards. Given the mats costs at the beginning of a new expansion you will likely make more by either farming or playing the AH...unless the bots gonna run amok again and ruin the show for all.). Last but not least it is a weekly...600 gold once per week... big deal....really.<br />
<br />
I think it's sad to see that thing gone given that new players won't get a chance to experience this fun mini-game. if it's really about the loot then just cut the gold drop by 50%(not much harder than taking the keys) which will likely make it worse than WoD dailies...or even better: Scale the mobs roughly with char-level or itemlevel(as long as no additional achievements are added it really doesn't matter if it's a bit easier on level 96 than on 98 or 91).</div></div><hr />

Why should people suspect that they would remove Trove? At all? Old content may be irrelevant, but you can still go back and do it. Trove doesn't reward anything useful or usable beyond the 500g, unlike challenge modes or the &quot;ahead of the curve&quot; achievement, AND they waited to the last minute to tell us. I generally defend Blizzards actions, but what is the purpose of removing this? 500g isn't a lot of money and as always, it'll be even less in Warlords with expansion inflation.<br />

No support for the game was added yet, but keep in mind that at Blizzcon 2013 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3545-World-of-Warcraft-Q-A) it was mentioned that people were working on a side project to update the old Warcraft games to run on modern versions of Windows.<br />
<br />
I was pretty clear that it isn't supported yet...</div></div><hr />

But you are using the logic that everyone automatically levels to 90 then does all the end game content and quests on every zone. This is simply not true,some people skip the zone entirely or level through pvp or just level alts constantly or play with family and friends messing around at level 70,and a thousand more reasons. I for one fall into a shit load of categories, Kids, work, socializing, alts, family and friends, and loads more,i only just reached 90 myself this January i think it was and after that i didnt do much.</div></div><hr />
