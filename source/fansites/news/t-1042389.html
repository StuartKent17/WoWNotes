Transmogrification Rules<br />
As mentioned in the original post, mailing an heirloom to your alt will strip any transmogrification effect. There was a bug that sometimes prevented this from happening, but it is now fixed. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/198953/transmogrification-rules) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2690981437?page=18#347))<br />
<br />
LFR 10 Man Size<br />
Having the LFR group size set at 25 allows for a more forgiving experience should errors be made by individual players — after all, we believe Raid Finder groups should be a fun way to experience raid content without feeling too punishing to new or inexperienced raiders.<br />
<br />
In regards to the loot issues you mention, such as people winning the same item twice, we're working on a solution for this. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/209022/looking-for-raid-should-have-a-10-man-raiding-option) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3061921536?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
Different Deathwing Endings for Different Difficulty Levels<br />
In terms of storytelling and content accessibility, there isn't a real difficulty. The way we handled Ragnaros was kind of unique, but he's not the final boss of this expansion.<br />
<br />
Your idea is quite contrary to our motivation for implementing multiple difficulties. We want as many people as possible to be able to experience the story, while still preserving many of the more prestigious rewards and achievements for those who complete Heroic difficulty. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/209095/deathwing-died-with-a-whimper-mild-spoilers) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3729953121?page=1#6))<br />
<br />
Why do we have to pay real money for pets/mounts?<br />
Pets and mounts are entirely cosmetic, they don't give you any in-game benefit or edge over others, therefore they're not needed, and the statement that they're &quot;much better&quot; than the ones in the game is completely subjective.<br />
<br />
There are some rare pets and mounts in the game that are only obtainable from certain quests or encounters. If you prefer collecting things through the game, you could focus on getting all of those.

<br />
Alright.<br />
<br />
42 million health<br />
23 seconds to burn tendon in 1 phase (if it's more on heroic, let me know please)<br />
<br />
That's approximately 1.8 MILLION dps required to get it in one burn. That's a little over 100k per person if you 18 dps it. If you're implying with gear that we'll do 100k on every burn phase then you're delusional.<br />
<br />
Approximately 52k DPS per person if you do 2 burn phases per tendon. That is an UNGODLY amount of DPS required.<br />
<br />
As it stands now, for 39 million, it'll be about 94k per person with 1 burn, 47k dps PER PERSON for 2. It still won't be any fucking where near easy. Please stop talking outta your ass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
103k/51.5k DPS per person isn't mathematically impossible. It is actually fucking impossible to keep up with it when the numbers are that high. You will get absolutely overrun with bloods, which is what is happening for most people atm. Bloods are just overrunning it.</div></div><hr />

&quot;pre nerf&quot; spine is absolutely no different than spine currently. The HP changes did nothing to the execution of the fight, or any mechanics. The reduction of the corruption's HP, if anything, buffed the fight.<br />

<br />
As it stands now, for 39 million, it'll be about 94k per person with 1 burn, 47k dps PER PERSON for 2. It still won't be any fucking where near easy. Please stop talking outta your ass.<br />
<br />
You have about 18 or 18.5 seconds of actual DPS time on the tendon.</div></div><hr />

&quot;pre nerf&quot; spine is absolutely no different than spine currently. The HP changes did nothing to the execution of the fight, or any mechanics. The reduction of the corruption's HP, if anything, buffed the fight.<br />

Can you? I'm a healer so I wasn't really focusing on that (we just got the normal spine...go ahead and laugh :P) but some of the DPS were saying with target macros you can target it before it actually &quot;appears.&quot; If I'm wrong, let me know =)<br />
<br />
But yeah, about 18 seconds makes it even CRAZIER. People need to realize that it was pretty much borderline impossible, not like Yogg where it was theorized to be impossible...this is about as impossible as it gets. INCREDIBLY overtuned.<br />

I was going to say I'm giving first hand experience and feedback about this so wtf!<br />
<br />
My guess is this is Blizzard's clever way of gating the content. They do not want guilds getting through the instance in 1 weeks so they made spine incredibly difficult so nobody could do it. The HP of the mobs is higher than that of the PTR even though the feedback threads had people saying everything had too much HP. Blizzard then reduces the HP of the mobs to make people think it's doable now. The result is the tendons and amalgamations still have more HP than they did on the PTR, and the HP reductions show 0 difference in strategy and execution.<br />
<br />
To anyone saying guilds pulled the QQ card to Blizzard, do you think too much HP was going to stop the best players in the world from figuring something out to defeat the encounter?</div></div><hr />

From everything I've heard and read, the buff didn't make the fight any easier, and it is still pretty near impossible in current gear. So until you can look objectively at the situation, please refrain from being a part of it.</div></div><hr />

If they firmly believe it's doable, albeit, rediculously hard even after you spend few weeks farming gear, then there's no reason to change it. They are most likely allowing Spine to be like this, to finish bug testing HC Madness and waiting to possbily patch any surprises for Madness. They didn't get rid of the bugs on Sinestra and Raggy when guilds got there alot sooner than Blizzard thought. Makes sense to me anyway.</div></div><hr />

I have come to the conclusion that you are one to not be taken seriously. People would quit if it was impossible to do. Let's say they are in full heroic gear and it's still impossible to down, people would quit. You can't just say &quot;Here is a raid boss, that drops loot, and allows you to progress in the raid, but we've made it unkillable, enjoy&quot;<br />
<br />
If you can't see why an unkillable boss is bad, then you have some problems with your higher cognitive functions.</div></div><hr />

Actually the most major change about the fight is this one:<br />
Hideous Amalgamations with the Superheated buff no longer pulse their AE damage after being thrown from Deathwing's back.<br />

The idea about spine and madness should really be for them to be intented for someone who has farmed all previous content; so a good 15 ilvls higher. This can be a very significant increase in dps. Especially in Cata the world first race was not based on how well the encounters were tuned but rather on how well top guilds can adapt strategies to allow content to be done at much lower ilvl. This is a significant design issue actually. Not to mention that it has forced guilds to raid for hours on end hoping to get through an encounter. <br />
<br />
My personal opinion is that the very existance of heroic loot is bad design by itself but I understand most people don't share that opinion. But it still is an issue that people are essentially forced to try fights at much lower ilvls because they want to be in the race. Look at what the most challenging encounters have been in recent raids for the top guilds; harsh dps checks. Tactics could be worked for any other issues, what delayed kills was harsh dps checks that had to be beaten through creativity (look at baleroc), not to mention that the most common answer is shedding healers for more dps which just doesn't help the community. <br />
<br />
The nerf to health might have been because Blizz saw numbers that suggested the fight not being possible even at intented gear levels. But check what happened last time when such a prediction happened. We got the Yogg+0 kill. Imagine if Blizz had just decided to nerf the health early; how much less exciting that would have been both for Stars and for all the people who cheered for that kill.<br />
<br />
Anyway don't assume that someone doesn't have a clue just because they disagree with you, that's the best way to make an ass of yourself.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it was not impossible, its impossible when the players (i dont think they all reforge/change gear in every 6/8 25m guild after trying him) dont unterstand how to do 52k+ over a small amount of time. It was hardly overtuned but not only because the tendor had 3m more than now, the main problem was the &quot;unlimited&quot; amount of blood in the third step, if they nerfed the amount or the damage from them also, the boss will be killed by every 6/8 25m guild in the next few hours. I never saw such a early nerf (even impossible dps baleroc got it 1week later). In my opinion i dont like nerfs in the first id on non bugged encounters.

Why change the hp of an encounter that has been out for a week and a half (less than 1 week for heroic)? Why should the final fights for an expansion be killable with mostly firelands heroic gear? shouldnt they have to gear up inside DS heroic to actually manage him? <br />
<br />
As far as I remember I didnt see paragon kill Lich King heroic in tier 9 pieces. What is impossible today, might be possible in a couple of weeks when people are geared in DS heroic. <br />
<br />
You need like 80-100k dps from EVERY dps to kill a tendon in one phase. Which is impossible with gear or not</div></div><hr />

it was never meant to be killed in 1 nuke phase, even with the reduction in hp. Bear in mind that it is similarly dps challenging in 10m HC, which is unchanged, plus the fact that all the reductions also affects 25m NORMAL, means that it had nothing to do with addressing &quot;impossible&quot; dps</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blgdinger</div><div class="date">2011-12-13, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah it was not impossible, its impossible when the players (i dont think they all reforge/change gear in every 6/8 25m guild after trying him) dont unterstand how to do 52k+ over a small amount of time. It was hardly overtuned but not only because the tendor had 3m more than now, the main problem was the &quot;unlimited&quot; amount of blood in the third step, if they nerfed the amount or the damage from them also, the boss will be killed by every 6/8 25m guild in the next few hours. I never saw such a early nerf (even impossible dps baleroc got it 1week later). In my opinion i dont like nerfs in the first id on non bugged encounters. Gz for all non exploiters for their 7/8 tonight ;)The amount of completely inaccurate and stupid comments/guesses made within this post is astounding. You really think guilds that are on spine didn't change gear/specs/reforges/enchants to maximize dps/healing/tanking? As I said before, the HP changes didn't do ANYTHING to the fight in terms of execution or mechanics. I'm not sure what the &quot;'unlimited' amount of blood in the third step&quot; means, but blood can easily become a real issue before you even get the first plate off. The fight isn't impossible, but the likeliness of anyone killing it is extremely small because of the execution require to do it. You're still looking at about a 30 minute fight, which is completely uncalled for considering the fight shouldn't take that much time. Illidan was designed in such a way that it took 20 minutes to kill him originally, but spine is nowhere near the type of fight Illidan was to warrant a 30 minute encounter. My guild has a strategy that would probably work if we did it correctly, but it's just brutal going through the long attempts. I don't mind it because if a fight was meant to be long then so be it. When C'thun was being first killed and those kills were over 13 or 14 minutes that was considered pretty crazy. I actually have to applaud Blizzard for devleoping Yor'sahj in such a way that it takes all 10 minutes just to kill him. That fight is tuned perfectly.</div></div><hr />

Different Deathwing Endings for Different Difficulty Levels<br />
In terms of storytelling and content accessibility, there isn't a real difficulty. The way we handled Ragnaros was kind of unique, but he's not the final boss of this expansion.<br />
<br />
Your idea is quite contrary to our motivation for implementing multiple difficulties. We want as many people as possible to be able to experience the story, while still preserving many of the more prestigious rewards and achievements for those who complete Heroic difficulty<br />
Thats should not be hard, just put another fountain / elementium armour plate in the capital city for those who cannot reach heroic to see the ending.</div></div><hr />

<br />
agreed, yor'sahj&gt;hagara&gt;zonozz&gt;morchok but then why only the 25m nerf in hp/dmg to yor'sahj? Are we suggesting that all 10m normal and heroic content are perfectly tuned? some 10m guilds are finding these 10m fights difficult due to their lack of a certain class, such as resto druid/holy pala/rogue. <br />
<br />
And why should heroics be killed strictly in the order the bosses are met? Look at the lootship in ICC, the next HM after marrowgar. Look at majordomo in firelands.. HM is probably easier than normal and is probably next in choice after shannox/alysrazor HMs. If hagara is easier than yor'sahj at the current gear levels, then so be it. If it warrants a fix, I don't see why it is only exclusive to 25m.<br />
<br />
As an afternote, I can't believe they keep nerfing the LFR difficulty. I've never seen any wipes at DW because the bolt/shrapnel/impale damage was always a joke, and the ice wall speeds on hagara were already slow enough. Tbh, if they make it so easy it discourages people from actually playing... why try maximize dps/obey mechanics when you can either afk/ignore things like heroic will/dream/soaking and still get the loot?</div></div><hr />

Actually my ranking hasn't changed from PTR, Yor'sahj &gt; Zon'ozz &gt; Hagara &gt;= Morchok. Our officers decided to not use the well known and much used easymode of Hagara and it required all of 50 minutes - making lines included and we all know how hard it is to make a line.<br />
<br />
Yor'sahj was quite RNG. The fight is killable in ~10 minutes before nerf. But depending on what you get on the repeat phase that you still do you may or may not kill him (multiple 1% wipes qq). Depending on what you get in the Enrage phase you may also get a few seconds of extra time or not. We got lucky and didn't have Black on last phase you do execute and only Red for the enrage phase - which we didn't even need. Somehow we actually beat the enrage.<br />
<br />
Tbh the only nerfs the fight needed on 25HC was maybe make it so you get a non-Black in phase 7 (or one where you kill black) and lower Damage from the small adds, I was almost getting 1shot in Meta from melee hits, mages and moonkins were getting destroyed when unlucky. Actually thinking about it a bit of RNG is good, just the add damage would have been fine, maybe add HP a bit so you don't stack AoE so much.</div></div><hr />

And as i already said too it dont change the real difficulty alot but, atleast when they realy only reduced the healthpoints, talking from a illidan 30min fight is totaly bulls..., if you always take 3 amalgam to down 1 tendor and play the hardmode wrong you would end by a 17-18m fightime, if you play it right you would end by 13-14m, what is ok compared to other endbosses</div></div><hr />

I hope this is trolling. For me, the expansion is over when MoP goes live. As long as you have no real chance to compete for any first place whatsoever, why should it matter to you? Play your own game and be content with what you get. <br />
<br />
4.3 is as great as it could be. And a boss which is impossible to beat has nothing to do with great raid content. It has something to do with developers not knowing what is possible in their own game -&gt; bad work, nothing more.</div></div><hr />

We tried also a tactic which would take us more than ~30 minutes and its incredibly difficult because their is no room for mistakes. <br />
The huge problem is the blood. Even with the first plate off, the corrupting blood gets so overwhelming. <br />
The point is that you cant kill the whole blood because the dead blood respawns. You cant easily say &quot;lets clear all this blood&quot;, because it will come again.<br />
So you have to deal with tons of blood. <br />

Yes, Blizzard made a boo-boo and actually (heaven forbid) overtuned something. This problem is trivial, however, compared to the absolute facerolling non-HM has become. Raiding has gone downhill steadily since Karazhan, with only a brief respite in Ulduar. I DON'T WANT to see Deathwing less than two weeks after he is unleashed. I want to bang my head on bosses for a week each, and earn my way there. I am perfectly happy to work on hard modes after that, stretching out my gameplay value even further.<br />
<br />
Turning regular mode into easy mode, and adding a pure faceroll mode, just sucks out the energy from the whole game. Why even bother to attempt the hard version, when the reward is nothing but a slightly different color glow on the gear everyone else is wearing?<br />
<br />
TBC's difficulty was perfect. Just getting going in Kara took time, as you actually had to spend a long time in the honestly difficult heroics to get the gear needed for Moroes. It was then a long and beautiful slog all the way through to Kael, consuming month's of my guilds time. I was still extracting enjoyment and useful gear out of Kara and heroics for the better part of a year. Then came WotLK, where I had four Naxx epics the day I hit 80. Cata wasn't much better. Which is more fun? Raining purples or working for your loot?</div></div><hr />

And also, refering both to Spine and to Yor'sar (which was tuned perfectly in his original form), why the hell do they nerf encounters after 1 week, and why the hell do they nerf only the dps/gear ratios of the encounters, when its obvious that with each week the fights will become much easier due to gear...<br />

So Blizzard goes to California Adventure for their Holiday Party. The park has a water show with light and stuff projected on it.

<br />
Guild stuck working on a tough boss ? Too bad, IWIN mechanics push you through it faster than your own learning ability.<br />

And as i already said too it dont change the real difficulty alot but, atleast when they realy only reduced the healthpoints, talking from a illidan 30min fight is totaly bulls..., if you always take 3 amalgam to down 1 tendor and play the hardmode wrong you would end by a 17-18m fightime, if you play it right you would end by 13-14m, what is ok compared to other endbossesThis is the best post I have ever read in my entire life!<br />

I was wondering when the fake retune was going to be done to fix encounters, all so their favorite little &quot;got caught so we had to pretend ban them&quot; guilds would still have a shot at world first. It wasn't like they were going to fix any of these encounters until then.<br />
<br />
The thing is, If everybody in our guild was ilvl400+ I wonder how the fight would go with that gear the encounter in its current state. It's not really a matter of being too hard or not, the problem right now is really a numbers thing that isn't just going to be solved by gear. The encounter is designed in a neat way but the mechanics need to be tweaked, otherwise it's really bananas.<br />
<br />
The nerd to Yor'sahj, however, was absolutely uncalled for. It is now an absolute joke :\</div></div><hr />
