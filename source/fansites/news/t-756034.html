Grim Batol Screenshots and Dungeon Loot<br />
Grim Batol is now active on beta servers and players can explore the instance as they wish (flying mounts work there apparently), here are a couple of screenshots from this dungeon.<br />

<br />
Now that all dungeons are now active on beta realms (more on that later), a lot of items have been discovered on PTRs. I cannot sort them by instance yet but lvl 85 normal instances are definitely dropping ilvl 333 loot. Couple of issues with the new in-game cache format, we'll stick to screenshots for the moment.<br />
<br />
Models aren't implemented yet.<br />

Pestilence<br />
We're starting to think that the ship has just sailed on Pestilence. As I said, our original intent was that Blood Boil be the main AE attack, but now we're considering making Blood Boil more for tanking, letting Frost use Howling Blast and letting Unholy use Pestilence, because, you know, diseases.<br />
<br />
That is a really great idea. Have you given any thought as to how you would implement it? Like would Unholy be the only spec that could spread full strenght diseases? <br />
Something like that. Full strength might be too powerful, but we'll see. Unholy still has a few too many talents like Improved Icy Touch and Corrupting Strikes, so this might be a good replacement (though likely deeper than those two examples). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726013260/pestilence-replace-with-blood-boil/))<br />

Retribution Mastery<br />
We have actually changed Retribution's mastery. Having both it and Inquisition boost Holy damage was giving too much power to things like Exorcism (over which you have very little control) and not enough to things like Templar's Verdict (which is supposed to be the centerpiece of your rotation). The new mastery will emphasize Templar's Verdict more. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26723612722/ret-s-mastery/))<br />

Warlock Pets<br />
While we generally still want to adhere to the goal of Felhunter = Affliction, Felguard = Demo, Imp = Destro, we want everyone to use their other demons sometimes too. That involved making a lot of changes.<br />
<br />
For starters, their damage and survivability will move closer together. We want the decision to be more about utility of their abilities than dps or squishiness. Under the new scaling model, the Imp and Succubus have health, mana and armor not too far off from the Felhunter.<br />
<br />
We tried out the Imp doing friendly damage when he dispelled because we thought it was interesting for the demonic feel, but we have already removed it. We also tried an ability to knock allies out of CC that break on damage, but we now think that would be too powerful. Currently the Imp still does a dispel on allies.<br />
<br />
We wanted to split Devour Magic into offensive and defensive components or else we felt like the Felhunter would always be the obvious choice for PvP. Now you can choose between having an off-the-GCD silence / interrupt and an offensive dispel / purge -or- having a defensive dispel, increases health and an escape tool.<br />
<br />
Like everything else in beta, these are subject to change. We're close to being able to get more max-level PvP feedback and will buff or nerf abilities accordingly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726062446/felguard-has-bladestorm-ms-in-latest-build/))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Flying mounts can work in all instances, you need to enter while mounted and you can fly, it's currently a bug I believe that they are aware of. If you mount WHILE INSIDE the instance, it won't let you fly.<br />
<br />
Also, currently on Beta, the only end-game instances that have gear is Grim Batol (4 Bosses) and Halls of Origination (7 Bosses). They drop ilvl 333 gear and there's quite a few upgrades from there. Lost City of Tol'vir (lvl 84-85), Vortex Pinnacle (lvl 81-85), and Stonecore (lvl 81-85) still do not drop gear as of yet.<br />
<br />
The bosses are all pretty simple as well in these two instances that drop gear, the first boss of Grim Batol is the only one that is badly bugged because his bleed attack hits for 30k a tick when it's supposed to deal 6k a tick.</div></div><hr />

If you look closer, you might actually see that those weapons are meant for casters. I'm not sure how you play your mage, but its definitely not one that relies on melee damage.</div></div><hr />

Instead of a mastery that increases the damage of holy wrath, exo, conc, judgements, wich was only half our damage, it will now benefit just Templars Verdict? A move usable after 12 seconds of combat? A physical move that is mitigated for 60% by tanks and 40 % by other plate users while DK's get masterys that bypass armor.<br />

Dungeons weren't the problem with WOTLK. Sunwell gear was as good/better than the majority of heroic drops, so yes the gear reset is bigger this time. HOWEVER, the problem last time was that the ratings weren't designed around hard mode loot, which basically made like 7 tiers of loot in WOTLK instead of the 4 they had intended.<br />
<br />
Not to mention they are doing a buff on stamina so the impact of a huge dps inflation might not be as bad. If they can keep dps under 50k in normal situations at the end of the expansion I think they will be ok.</div></div><hr />

In the end PvE players will still be killed in 2 - 3 GCD regardless of ridiculous amount of hp (~ 90k).</div></div><hr />

You are forgetting that the level cap for Cataclysm is to basically have the effect of 10 levels. If they had chosen to raise the level cap to 90, they would have had to come up with another continent, which is not what Blizzard wanted. You are also forgetting that stamina is getting increased on items to bring the health pools of non-plate wearers closer to plate classes, healing is going to be nerfed, more emphasis on CC and far less AoE, plus much more... I honestly don't know where you've have been lately, but you are not looking at the larger picture.<br />

So wait, level 85 normals drop level 83 loot?<br />
<br />
Well, it's not as if level 80 normal dungeons dropped level-cap gear. &gt;_&gt;<br />

I wish the spell sword wasn't a sword, or that shaman could equip swords in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I would want my main being able to wield a sword. Just thinking about it makes me feel weird. *lol*<br />
<br />
Although your comment does remind me of that one conversation in the Barrens general channel a long time ago. I don't remember all of it, but it involved mages wearing swords and one player responding with, &quot;I blame Gandalf.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Maybe about the stat but you can count on the &quot;boring&quot; aspect of these loots : 2 primary stats and 2 secondary stats, that's all you're gonne get. But you can reforge, dont forget that. Reforge will probably give the min-maxers a lot of satisfaction, me thinks :p</div></div><hr />

So pretty much Blizzard has nerf'd DPS extremely? If you're wearing mostly 277 and only doing 6kish, then they've brought it down quiet a bit, seeing as you should be around 12k with that gear.</div></div><hr />

Well don't forget that Blizzard basically just got to the point at which they can start to consider numbers. Before, they had stated repeatedly that they weren't far enough into beta to consider numbers yet.</div></div><hr />

You have to keep in mind that ICC currently inflates dps with the 30% buff. Also, running in 10 and 25 man raids also means buffs that increase that dps substantially further. Right now my mut rogue is in full 277 other than 2 264 pieces, does over 17k dps on Saurfang, but only hits about 7k single target dps with no buffs.</div></div><hr />

I would, but that level 83 mace you are referring to drops in Grim Batol, for which you can sign up in the LFD tool starting at level 84. And to be able to sign up, you have to have an average ilvl of 305(items in your inventory count too), which is not that easy to get. Because of that wait-times for Grim Batol/Halls of Origination are sometimes 1-2h as DPS. Oh, and then there is that nice bug that sometimes crashes your client as soon as you mouseover the first mob in a dungeon. :-/</div></div><hr />

My guess is that the pre-cata patch will give them the best feedback as to which classes are underpowered or overpowered, just like the insanely unbalanced patch before WotLK shipped.<br />
<br />
Also: &quot;Like everything else in beta, these are subject to change. We're close to being able to get more max-level PvP feedback and will buff or nerf abilities accordingly.&quot;-GC<br />
Guess that solves the debate as to whether this game is balanced around PvP or not..<br />

<br />
I think you may underestimate what all the new gear and itemization conveys. If you look at the plate one, the healer pants in essence have Stam, Int, Spellpower, Crit, and MP5 on them. Its just you get spellpower merged with int and mp5 is just spirit now. Same itemization, you could argue simplified, but its mostly getting used to attack power being merged onto strength &amp; agility. Plus spellpower being merged onto int. Its not so much boring as it is more straight forward. I don't feel we should have to scroll through itemization on some gear before we can tell if its an upgrade :).<br />
<br />
And as far as I knew, spellpower was going to remain on weapons to help balance caster weapon upgrades being a significant damage or healing increase similar to melee class weapons being a big upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you look at the offhand and add its stats to either of those 1h weps, the staff actually has slightly more in all stats making it better.<br />
<br />
only caster weapons are going to have raw SP on them, the offhands don't.</div></div><hr />
