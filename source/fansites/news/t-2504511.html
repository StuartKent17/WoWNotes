<br />
yeah...the almost child like giddiness most of those guys are displaying as well as their obvious passion is perhaps the single best &quot;selling&quot; video / cinematic Blizzard ever produced and it speaks volumes about Classic as a game worth playing.<br />
<br />
There's a certain charm, for lack of a better description, to the original game and how it played missing from subsequent iterations.</div></div><hr />

I worked at Blizzard from 05-12. It makes me happy to see these long time vets I saw daily that were instrumental in the growth of the game getting to sit back and have some fun talking about it. <br />
<br />
These guys poured their heart and soul into the work they did. Keep in mind though, that the people working there now are doing the same thing. Ion and his team are just as committed to WoW as Jeff, Tom, Alex and the rest were.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I'd normally be among the first to call them out on emotionally manipulative marketing like this, but I feel they're being genuine. They made something special, and getting to return to it 15 years later is enough to thaw the iciest heart.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why anyone would not want to experience the past again, it made us who we are, what we like, what we did and what we archived. Good and bad, it doesn't matter, without the past you would not be where you are now. All my past experiences growing up that I collected I still value to this date, some games, like WoW Classic, Diablo 1, Worms Armageddon will ALWAYS be my personal favorite. My music taste is still the same, I still enjoy the same sports, I even still have some of my friends from back then. That's a good thing, I think many people that are mad or disappointed about their past have deep regrets and can't understand other people loving their home/past. I will love it so much!</div></div><hr />

<br />
its also a referance to what many people often dream about; To go back in time and &quot;relive&quot; those days when we were young. In many ways we can never do that, in any aspect at all. <br />
<br />
This time around, many of us sort of can. This game was a huge deal for many young gamers out there and it shaped many lives.<br />
<br />
Im stoked!</div></div><hr />

If it wasn't for Kern's efforts we probably wouldn't have Classic but I guess that's where your disdain for him comes from. Which is very satisfying to me</div></div><hr />

this video focuses so obviously all the marketing keypoints of wow classic. uff. „a few cool guys having totally fun playing their old memories again“ blah blah blah... while in reality they checked the state of the game since its in alpha and are overall long over it, since they do that shit since 15 years or more and its just their job and their product. they try so hard to serve that picture that they even could wrote subtitles on it, what marketing wanna express here.<br />
<br />
its laughable. imo (since i working also in sw development since 20 years) you either do nothing and let marketing make its job by just focus on the game itself, or you do something they did with terry crews and others or take some unknown ppl that never played wow. but this video is so eyebleeding pseudo shit, god...<br />

Very little actual footage of them playing the game. Makes me think of those movie trailers that really sell a shit movie by showing everything great in the trailer and then when you get to the movie there’s an hour and 55 minutes of garbage. How much of their reunion do you think they actually spent talking about and playing the game vs them talking about their families, health, and what they’ve been up to? The video really sold nostalgia, and it did it well.<br />
That said, I hope everyone enjoys Classic and it lives up to what they want it to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this video focuses so obviously all the marketing keypoints of wow classic. uff. „a few cool guys having totally fun playing their old memories again“ blah blah blah... while in reality they checked the state of the game since its in alpha and are overall long over it, since they do that shit since 15 years or more and its just their job and their product. they try so hard to serve that picture that they even could wrote subtitles on it, what marketing wanna express here.<br />
<br />
its laughable. imo (since i working also in sw development since 20 years) you either do nothing and let marketing make its job by just focus on the game itself, or you do something they did with terry crews and others or take some unknown ppl that never played wow. but this video is so eyebleeding pseudo shit, god...<br />

I enjoyed the retrospective on their design choices and the tone of the video.<br />
<br />
Piss off and be negative elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

From my own perspective, all of my greatest memories of WoW were between Vanilla - WotLK. Not to say the other expansions were poor quality, just that after WotLK it felt as though there was more and more a disconnect to the local community. Looking forward to Classic and hopefully TBC, WotLK in the future.</div></div><hr />

I mean it's a video promoting a game, to an audience that play the game. Why would we want to watch an hour of them catching up on their real lives? Overly skeptical, yes obviously it's an advertisement ... duh :p:confused:<br />
<br />
It's great to further build and maintain the hype for those of us looking forward to the release.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, it’s an ad. People are treating it like it’s a feature length “hit you in the feels” end all to a discussion. It’s disingenuous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not at all disingenuous - they haven't presented it as a 'feature length' that's just something you have surmised based on feedback. <br />
<br />
It is what is is, a small clip that allows them to build and maintain the hype. And it's well done I agree.<br />
Personally I enjoyed the small insight into the development and think that all of them came across sincere.</div></div><hr />

It’s a game issue, not a tech issue. Vanilla was simply not designed to have more than X players at the same time, not enough “space” or in-game mobs/resources else.<br />
<br />
This cannot be changed even if now there’s enough tech to handle 10 times the players at the same time.</div></div><hr />

Sure, so the issue had to be thoroughly recreated to give exactly the same amount of pain in the ass, right?</div></div><hr />

Well you Classic boys did Ask for 'NO CHANGES' so deal with the queues and the horrible grind. I played vanilla in 2005 and won't be putting myself through that again lool I'll be playin borderlands 3. Lootin and Shootin.</div></div><hr />

It’s impossible to not recreate it, the game map is the same it was before.</div></div><hr />

oh, i am very excited for classic. i play this game without interruption since 2005. but that does not mean i take this show that ppl deliver there, and the reality of that business (i also myself live in) for serious. oh when you ppl would work in that regard and look how the truth this.... oh boy, on this forum there are so much unrealistic ppl that really do not get how companies like blizzard work and what it means to live in such a job as i.e. alex afrasiabi for that long. there is nothing conspiratorial in it or such shit. its just the nature of things and the natural flow things go when you work in such a business for many years. but when i look at some ppl here it is like watching 4 years old kids that talking about santa. god...</div></div><hr />

So funny when people NOW want GC back. Apparently he was the lesser evil. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyways, this video made me remember the first time I played WoW on Gamescom, when it was in closed beta. And I'm sad that buckets of money made them deviate from challenging game design to everyone should get an appreciation award...<br />
<br />
I hope at some point they open Servers with affixes to them.. like PVP; +25% Mob DMG/HP; no LFG tool.. hey, I can dream.</div></div><hr />
