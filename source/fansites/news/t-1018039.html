<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of the subscriptions were lost in China. <br />
There is normally an increase in subscriptions around December. <br />
The decreased profit came from all of the games in development and no launches occurring. <br />
There will be at least two major releases next year.<br />

People like to see if the game they love is doing well or not. /shrug<br />
<br />
Not surprised by those subscriber numbers. I think the annual pass and the run up to Pandaria will actually bring a lot back. We've entered the pre-expansion doldrums as soon as it was announced. LOL<br />
<br />
Two major releases = Heart of the Swarm and Mists of Pandaria, right? Oh wait there is D3 as well. So does that mean two NEW titles? O.o</div></div><hr />

My guess would be that they aren't totally confident that they can push HotS before christmas, so they said 2. D3 is pretty much done, and no way they pull an ICC again with Mists. Better to under promise and over deliver than vice versa.</div></div><hr />

Easy to explain. <br />
Gold farmers Switching from Farming accounts to Hacking player accounts to steal the gold. no sense leaving the farming accounts open when they are a drain on resources and when you get so much more from hacking players.<br />
I'm guessing quite a few of the lost accounts came from that.<br />
then there's casuals leaving cause the game was hard in ways they didn't want it to be.... and long timers leaving cause they've been playing since vanilla or TBC and are just bored.<br />
<br />
The Sky.It is not falling.<br />
Besides, when you look at Wow: Lame Panda Island and everything from this years blizzcon some things stand out to me.<br />
1: You can usually tell when a Pay MMO is starting to lose steam when they start offering game play (beyond a demo) free. blizzard has done that with 1-20 being free, and TBC being Free for people who purchase the original game.<br />

Chinese are very patient people but once they stop a game its doomed for many years... so keep it dropping and add expansions that does not fit in wow and see where it leads Blizzard..... Im prediciting a total amount of subscribers to maybe 2-3 million in 3 years... cause the other MMO's have catched up and surpassed Blizzard then.

Isn't Cataclysm not yet released there ? I think they're still in the postICC-preCata gap, if that's the case subscription lost can be considered pretty &quot;normal&quot;.<br />

I don't think so. They'll just find different ways of making money (more microtransactions/premium features) to offset the losses.</div></div><hr />

I'm one of those who quit. I didn't quit because it was lame, because of LOLPANDAS, it was too hard or etc. I quit because it has become such a fucking chore on the high end to find 24 people who aren't fuckwits. Seriously, it's like everyone forgot how to raid in WotLK. On top of all of that it's such a bitch keeping this game running. Every other week it seems lag pops up for the MT or for the MT healer or something. Because of this game I've learned more about my computer and how to fuck with it than in any classroom. I'm tired of the stress this game brings. I couldn't get back into raider in my old guild (leader said he didn't want me back into raiding though I was consistently outperforming raiders on their alts in the alt group week in and week out) nor find a guild that raided like 6 hours a week, progressed and got shit down. I'm also a Rogue, who while we do good dps, aren't real helpful to the group, so having 1 is usually enough for a 25man. I also no longer have any IRL friends playing this game, seeing as they all just got too busy to play seriously. I think I'll just stop here because you get the fucking point.<br />
<br />
/end rant. After reading all of that and likely being able to add more, it makes me wonder why I didn't quit sooner.<br />
<br />
Now that I feel better, the reason I quoted you was because I just wanted to add that the reason RS went up with so many accounts is because of the MASSIVE amount of botters/RWT'ers that came back once they rereleased Free Trade and the Old Wild. They just released a huge anti botting measure and the game went from 225k people consistently on at this time to around 70k. Once that Chart updates to include last month and this month, you should see a huge dropoff for RS too.<br />
<br />
Despite WoW being 100x more fun than RS it's 1000x more of a pain in the ass at the high end (and costs a lot more) so as of right now I play Runescape, mainly because it's something to do.</div></div><hr />

THIS! So much this! I'm betting MoP and this other &quot;major release next year&quot; will be awesome since Blizz's back is against the wall at this point. I know everybody is saying &quot;lol @ only 800k subs they still have 10mil+ oh noes!&quot;. Yea they still have over 10mil active subs, but when it comes to business standpoint, and investors, etc, once you taste the top they will never want to lose it, especially in this economy that we have. 1/10 (roughly) loss of subs will put pressure on blizzard from the people who write their checks to 'fix' it. Make no mistake about it they are worried, and it's time for Blizz to step it up, which they will I'm sure</div></div><hr />

But aisde, 800k sub loss, not surprising, Cata is just not as good ad TBC/Wotlk. MoP looks fantastic though (The fact that there is a race of panda people doesn't count, no one complains about our resident Cow-people or human goats.) and hopefully it'll bring more subs in. Out of curiosity I'd like to see how many people they got in with the new free trial (The level 20 capped jobby).</div></div><hr />

China has a very fascinating mass-bubble economy going on right now. The demographic of persons who play WoW in China are possibly those of a sub-middle class who are being literally sacrificed for the rising GDP of the country, and likely are unable to afford playing an MMO anymore.What I'm saying is that, yes, WoW lost subscribers but they didn't lose them to any other oncomming or pre-existing MMO.<br />

<br />
Despite their belief that the holidays bring more players - perhaps in previous years but they weren't bleeding like this in past holiday years. Nor did they have a STORM of games to compete with, now there's games like Rift that some people switched to for whatever reason, Star Wars coming, and even Battlefield/MW3 will entertain some and draw time away from the gamers.<br />
<br />
Then all the negative backlash over the Blizzcon announcements. Pandas...Pokemon...say what you will, maybe you love them...but there's apparently just as many people who don't.<br />

Are there really that many investors on this site? Why do people care so much unless it affects their money?<br />
<br />
I have stock in blizzard, activision, and EA. As long as some other Tech stocks. The news is more about fiscal trending for investors and it does directly affect the games we play. Shareholders dont make money that BOTTOM LINE gets bolder and bolder, meaning that they will do what it needs to do to cut costs. This will cause delays in production as a whole, and their ability to launch more modern games, or lets say give wow the polish that it needs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The upcoming releases of SWTOR and GW2 are going to play hell on WoW's subscription numbers as well. <br />
<br />
I don't think they are going to be able to claim a rise in subscriptions in one of these investor calls until MoP releases, but it's doubtful even then. Although the hate for WotLK is strong, it will be remembered as WoW's golden age at some point in the future I'm sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your reasoning is super cool, cause everyone knows Panda bears are held as pets by the majority of people. They are not really bears, they are more like plush animals you buy in a store. Or maybe it is, that they are one of the most ferocious bears to walk this planets surface, right next to polar bears. <br />
<br />
But lets ignore the fact, and enjoy the game with so ferocious gnome warriors who tank dragons 100 times the size of themselves. They are acceptable tho, cause they have pink pig tails - I see now.</div></div><hr />

More likely D3 and MoP next year. SC2 expac will be pushed because it doesn't have any sustained revenue built into it. It's only profit on units moved. If WoW has a prayer MoP has to be next year and no later than July.</div></div><hr />

Are there really that many investors on this site? Why do people care so much unless it affects their money?<br />
<br />
I am one of those investors. I do find it funny how people think 10.3 million people playing wow (and remember, they ONLY count those subscriptions with creditcards as active) as 'WoW is dying'. That is still well over 10 times as many people that have an active subscription on Rift and more than all the other Pay2Play mmo's out there combined, currently.</div></div><hr />

Terenas said it himself, &quot;No king rules forever.&quot; Blizzard is clearly backing out of this franchise to invest in their other two series. They've been created this decade... SC2 has done a great deal to the development of e-sports and they're gonna want to make D3 all it can be. They didn't even have the time to invest in an actual CGI trailer for MoP, whats that say? WoW may still have a lot of players but their other two ships have to potential to keep them around much longer. Even the plot has reached its climax, the only thing now they can do to introduce a greater threat than the destruction of the world would be Sargeras or the Titans... anything else would not satisfy the high expectations they've built us up gradually with each expansion. Its time to move on to something new, its not like Blizzard isn't presenting you with viable options.</div></div><hr />

The whole reason almost all Chinese studio used to farm on foreign servers is because that it wasn't profitable to farm on Chinese servers. If Chinese farmers quit, you'd see bigger drops in US and EU servers. <br />
<br />
Have you ever thought maybe those Chinese players quit because every patch they get the stuff shitted out by foreign players months later?</div></div><hr />

I really don't understand people's problem with a panda continent. The Pandaren was in Warcraft 3, it was part of the story. We have cow men, pig men, aliens (orcs and draneai), elves (2 kinds), demons, undead walking and talking, trolls, gnomes, goblins , dwarves, harpies, walking rock, water, air and fire things, magical spells (holy crap I can shoot fire out of my hands!!!) and a whole expac where we go TO ANOTHER PLANET that is shattered, it's not even a planet anymore, with floating islands and waterfalls out of rocks with no river. All this fantasy but pandas, that were already part of the lore...that's just kiddie stuff. <br />

If you played wow for years just because you didnt have a job, or if you couldnt quit a game you'd been bored of until you got a job, you're an unfortunate loser.</div></div><hr />

Its a rough month for games in general with BF being released only a mere 2 weeks ago and MW3 going live today. Add Fifa12 to that list and a stale wow and subs are bound to drop. Alot of people will play that for a while, but they will return once 4.3 goes active and numbers will rise again. Its no biggy. And as some other people pointed out; numbers dropping is a good thing. Blizzard wants those subs back, thats more content in a faster pace as a result.<br />
<br />
Nobody cares about Soccer :D</div></div><hr />

Pandas in WoW would probably increase Chinese subs.</div></div><hr />

The game saw a pretty good increase of Subs when Cata was launched, it makes some sense to lose these subs again after the &quot;hype&quot; calmed down. Of course, with a few extras to tag along with that simply because of Cata not being the best expansion to date.</div></div><hr />

Have you ever been to China? Do you know anyone in China? Ever talked to someone? Read a paper? Know anything at all about China except silly WoW forum myths about &quot;pandas are holy in China lol&quot;?<br />
<br />
Given Chinese nationalist sentiments I am pretty sure the fact that making a respectful homage to all things Chinese, as MoP by all indications is, will be fairly appreciated among Chinese players.<br />

Of course, Blizzard already has a problem here - at any time that you're losing subs instead of gaining them, that's bad, and 1.7 million in such a time is terrible - but if they can't fix it with those big elements in the mix, it wouldn't be too outlandish to suggest that WoW might be on an irreversable decline.

They won't get any new subscribers because the game has gotten way too expensive for a newbie.<br />

$30 for Classic + 1st X-pac<br />

<br />
It's worth noting that it's also possible to lose subscribers on a subscription. While it may entice players back, it can also isolate some players. It may well be the &quot;enough is enough&quot; point for some, especially is money is a concern. While Blizzard's prior expansions have had a positive effect on subscriptions overall, I don't think that they've been launched on such a significant decline before.<br />
<br />
What's also worth considering is that TOR is launching at the worst possible time for Blizzard. People may well decide to buy that instead of upgrading to the expansion.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it was just China that unsubscribed. Losing 10% of the player base is huge. Think about it. That's 10% less people to group with making queues increase.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There is normally an increase in subscriptions around December.&quot;<br />
<br />
And there's also an increase in people that sign up for gyms in January. It doesn't mean YOUR subscriptions will increase. New games are dropping in December. Star Wars TOR to name one big contender.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The decreased profit came from all of the games in development and no launches occurring.&quot;<br />
<br />
A bad expansion in Cataclysm with little content didn't help either. All in all, these four statements do very little to help the situation and only shows Blizzard is on the defensive.</div></div><hr />

So many people that don't understand that Pandaren were in WarCraft before Kung Fu Panda ever came out! Yes it was a joke then but technically PANDAREN WERE THERE FIRST. However, a lot of it probably has to do with the fact that the chinese people respect pandas like gods and would never consider them being violent ever. Its like putting Jesus in WoW as a playable character... anyway, a lot of people are also burned out and are going to other games... WoW will likely not have enough subs for Blizz to do another Xpac after MoP...

There are some MMO's that do have 2 and 3 million subscribers. I think this is more than end of the xpac bleed though. I'd say we're gonna get down to 8 million before the bleed is over and before Mists hits. Then we'll be lucky to jump up to 10 million subscribers before the bleed off continues. Wow IS in decline. No matter how much people stomp their feet and say it isnt so, the numbers show different. Its a 7 year old game. 7 year old graphics. 7 year old ideas. This isnt a bad thing and it doesnt mean you'll try to log on tomorrow, next week or next year even and find there is no more wow. It DOES mean that people need to face that this game is losing subscribers and will continue to. Its natural. I'd say Blizzard would have to pull a miracle off to completely reverse the declines and grow the numbers beyond what we hit with Wrath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They should sell Cata, period, and fold everything else into it. Cata was the rebirth anyway, it's the 1-60 and 80-85 so then just fold the middle sections in and sell that. When MoP comes out, OK then that's a new expansion pack just like TBC was to original WoW.<br />

<br />
Could you have interpreted this post any more incorrectly? Talk about being on the defensive.<br />
<br />
1) Mists of Pandaria, Heart of the Swarm, and Diablo 3 are tentatively coming out next year. Tentatively, because sometimes shit happens. At least 2 of those are absolutely ready to go. This is not a defensive statement. It's promotion. &quot;We have at least 2 coming, but maybe more!&quot;<br />
2) You doubt it was just China? DUH. Do you know what the word &quot;most&quot; means? It means not all. As in, not JUST China. No point in doubting cuz they straight up admitted it. Not defensive. You misunderstood.<br />
3) This one speaks for itself. Normally, there's an increase in December due to holiday sales. Everyone knows that. Damn near everything sells more during holidays. So this will be no different. Not a defensive comment, a statement of fact. The trend exists.<br />
4) Your opinions on the expansion do not influence investors. Sorry. Nor is it even pertinent to the statement. They didn't launch anything. They have a bunch of titles in development this year. Their profit was decreased due to the fact that they DIDN'T LAUNCH ANYTHING THIS YEAR and because they are currently investing big numbers into TITLES CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT (IE NOT LAUNCHED). <br />
<br />

<br />
That's the interesting thing. WoW doesn't actually have a proper competitor yet. Yes, Rift is there, but it was unable to take a strong enough playerbase from Blizzard's grasp to move in on WoW's territory. Rather than shifting to a rival service, it may seem that people are simply quitting altogether. That doesn't speak particularly well for what will happen once TOR (and maybe Guild Wars 2?) reaches release.<br />
<br />
I really don't think it's too absurd to expect WoW to have difficult days ahead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MoP and what? Another Blizzard game or are we still talking about wow?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the subscriptions were lost in China.&quot;<br />
<br />
I doubt it was just China that unsubscribed. Losing 10% of the player base is huge. Think about it. That's 10% less people to group with making queues increase.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There is normally an increase in subscriptions around December.&quot;<br />
<br />
And there's also an increase in people that sign up for gyms in January. It doesn't mean YOUR subscriptions will increase. New games are dropping in December. Star Wars TOR to name one big contender.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The decreased profit came from all of the games in development and no launches occurring.&quot;<br />
<br />
A bad expansion in Cataclysm with little content didn't help either. All in all, these four statements do very little to help the situation and only shows Blizzard is on the defensive.<br />
<br />
ok i'll start at the beginning of this.<br />
10% loss to players will not change the queue times at all, unless there has specifically been a loss ina role instead of overall, which there is still no evidence for.<br />
<br />
are you going to notice the loss player base? not really, dead servers will be offered free transfers to medium servers. Free character migrations will be offered, anyone remember those? i do.<br />
<br />
WoW is in decline. Period. I'm a wow fan, i still play it, and i didnt find cata boring at all. It is outdated graphically for one example. Its a 7 year old game. Thats immense. but every dog has its day.<br />
<br />
There are now as many players as there were at the &quot;golden age&quot; of wow. although the problem for blizzard is not now content or themes as many ate whining, its it simply that the game is not as &quot;flashy&quot; as it used to be for new members.<br />
<br />
gears of war is being released.... there have been 7 football managers released during wow existance and somehow these are never mentioned. different genre, different game, different target audience. you might like it personally, but you arent a cross section of the public, you and your opinion doesnt really matter.<br />
<br />
i agree that the game needs a littel touching up here and there, but any cries of class unbalance are generally cries of people who arent topping dps/hps etc. all classes and specs are viable for the game, some are easier, some are harder.<br />
<br />
i personally beleive that the loss in gamers is down to the dumbing down to the gear attainment in wow atm. bring back stages of raiding, players need to play thier way up instead of investing time to skip content. not completed bastion of twilight? no entrance to firelands then. attunement please? i have high hopes for LFR and challenge modes.<br />
<br />
blizzard will i'm sure make content patches free, before wow dies. reducing the sub, i do not believe will happen.<br />
<br />
was there not a sub loss in us/eu after cata launch? game being too hard etc etc? china got cata 5 months ago, 3 quarters = 9 months, hardly suprising that there was a continued loss in sub, unless you are assuming that the entire of china, didnt find the game harder, are better, whatever than the us/eu. 4 months loss previously announced, 5 months of china cata losses now added and we see total losses due to initial cata release.<br />
<br />
there are subs increasing and decreasing all the time. imo blizzard should overtune 4.3 to prevent an exodus. there lies the problem, make it too hard, ppl quit. make it too easy ppl quit.<br />
<br />
ppl complain no matter what. but i do wonder one thing; if you hate/dislike/dont play wow, why are you posting/reading/trolling about it?<br />
<br />
if i could have 1 wish.... blizzard please make loot harder to get, make me appreciate each and every drop which i ACHIEVE through playing the game, and stop giving loot to clueless fuckwits who havent even made an attempt to improve.<br />
<br />
i really hope blizzard pull wow back to the jaws of what seems to be inevitable, as i've kinda grown to love the game. as sad as i'm sure someone will point out that is, its has become part of my life. hell i've played it for 7 years which is longer than i've known my wife.<br />
<br />
sad times, but many more good ones ahead.<br />

Yes, you can sit back and claim, &quot;So what, I have fun and that's all that matters to me.&quot; If that's so, that's fine. What that massive loss represents though is customer dissatisfaction. Now it's very easy to sit back and make comments like, &quot;Well, people just want to try new things&quot; or &quot;People just want to take a break&quot;, but what it represents is something much bigger. When a company can sit back and admit, &quot;Hey, maybe these people are leaving for a reason&quot; then do something about it, that's the sign of a truly great company.</div></div><hr />

Yes it is very possible to do that. Think of the sport games like Fifa or Pro Evolution Soccer. Both of those franchises exist way over decade (Fifa 18 years, PES 10 years) Both of those games have basicly same core gameplay unchanged since the beggining only a few tweaks here and there just like WoW.

WoW can do that to. Except that their supposed fun activity is struggling with terrible community that they brew themselves through annonimity tools like LFD and name and shame policy.<br />

WoW isnt dying because of content or such. It pushes out more content that any MMO despite it having such old game engine. The very fundamental problem of WoW is that Blizzard socially engineered its player base to be much much worse.</div></div><hr />

Some info:<br />
<br />
1. Classic and all Xpac packs are all free in taiwan and china servers, newcomers only need to pay subsciption fees to join.<br />
<br />
2. Taiwan servers have been conquered by chinese players since wrath, because chinese servers are running an xpac behind the rest of the world, currently china is on wotlk. Due to cultural differences, we generally consider chinese and taiwanese, different regions.<br />
<br />
3. For blizzard, taiwan is a region, china is a region, southeast asia is another region. For chinese cities like Hong Kong and Macau, Blizzard encourages them to play SEA if they want english games, or TW if they want chinese games. For WOW, HK and Macau is part of TW server service.<br />
<br />
4. In TW servers, there is a lot of bans recently that involves gold selling and account hacking. Basically anyone who is receiving a large amount of gold for no legit reason, would get them banned. Also in extreme, people who receive black gold (gold that is obtained illegally), even 1 copper from auction house, would result in first 7 days ban, followed by permanent ban. Thus, though there is still bot miners, it has decline compared to wrath.</div></div><hr />

If a significant portion of the lost subscribers were those who were banned, I think that Blizzard would have included that in their little fact list. It would have made the loss come off much better.<br />

<br />
Problem is, those banned accounts would have also counted as original subscription numbers. In other words, their subscribed population was lower than advertised... supposing they actually released sub numbers per region. For (fictitious) example, 2 million accounts in that region. 100k get banned. Well, the population was actually only 1.9 million to begin with, not the 2 million it was assumed to be.</div></div><hr />

So many people that don't understand that Pandaren were in WarCraft before Kung Fu Panda ever came out! Yes it was a joke then but technically PANDAREN WERE THERE FIRST. However, a lot of it probably has to do with the fact that the chinese people respect pandas like gods and would never consider them being violent ever. Its like putting Jesus in WoW as a playable character... anyway, a lot of people are also burned out and are going to other games... WoW will likely not have enough subs for Blizz to do another Xpac after MoP... They will probably end up doing a raid against Sargeras at the end of MoP the same way they tossed Sunwell on at the end of BC and call it the end of the warcraft storyline.<br />

I personally left about 4 weeks ago because I wasn't having fun. I'm not sure how to quantify 'fun', but apart from leveling alts (I had 8 85's, an 82 and a 73) and doing 'mount runs' over and over, I was pretty bored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I moderately agree with this. Rather than try to hotfix the time it took to get to a dungeon by introducing the LFD tool, they should have implemented scenario type option or created instances that only needed a healer or a tank, and appropriately adjusted the mechanics that way. The only people who had an impossible time finding groups prior to the LFD tool are the very people everyone wants to boot from the LFD groups, but can't because of the bloody timers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I tend to agree on the number. There may a steady decline in subscriptions but I am not worried for four more years. And whatever Blizzard loses in WoW, it gains with other titles, so the only conclusion = release D3 already, January will be ok.<br />
<br />
Although, I find it funny that they say 'usually it goes up in December', a little too optimistic to expect 2 million to resubscribe. Even if the numbers go up, it's going to be a small increase but I guess they have to feed the corporate sharks some meat chunks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard was banning 300k people a quarter back in 2008 when WoW only had 8 million subs. With their increased skill at catching botters and the 50% increase in subscriptions since then you easily bet that that number has doubled by now. The fact of the matter is that when botters get banned, THEY RESUB. Their subscriptions actually get counted twice in the month that they're banned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It all started back in 1940 during WWII, when they meant that big raids aren't that use- and successful. Then they shifted away from core European content and released &quot;Mists of Germania&quot; which did not solve the problem, only focused on new ones. Wrath of the Russian did not only kill a lot of farmers. but also destroyed the illusion of being &quot;skilled&quot; and &quot;imba&quot; as everybody could be imba now, especially those casual farmers. When they started the Burning Blockade in Berlin a lot of people quit their accounts and tried to play something different, like Duck 'n' Cover Online. The core gamer thought that their time had come and tried to convince others to take part at big raid like it was during Vanilla WorldWar. It did not happen. Since then nothing has happened anymore, no war, no real big raid, only small ones.<br />
Some of the guys who quit their accounts said that it all started with the lack of 40 or 50k man raids, but nobody really knows. They say that they all focused to support casual farmers but others say this was needed to make it more interesting as the mass does not like core war-ring.<br />
<br />
I don't know what will happen in future if more and more people quit. Perhaps they will all focus back on old times with the wars and so on. It was already announced a big new release, perhaps WWIII, who knows. Some use the annual financial crisis to bind people more to one &quot;Europe&quot;, to shift away from great wars, but others say it only focuses problems. <br />
<br />
We'll see what will happen. Stay tuned.<br />

Also 10.3 million people = 10,300,000 x $14.95= $153,985,000 PER MONTH. Thats $461,955,000 a quarter. $1,847,820,000 a year (although people on long term subscriptions probably lowers this number, other types of subs as well etc this is just a rough guestimate)(although now that the American dollar is worth less than the Aussie dollar i do find myself suddenly being charged in Aus$ rather than American...so they get more out of us) I swear if i see one more person bleatng this wow is dying nonsense /pimp hand<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't make anywhere near that number per month. They bring in about 400 million a quarter as total revenue and only 70-80 million of that is profit.<br />
<br />
Everyone seems to be forgetting that these are numbers from Q3, which ended 6 weeks ago before MoP was officially announced. The numbers are worse now because of continued subscription loss worldwide and the people who have quit over the MoP announcement, haven't even been included in these totals.<br />
<br />
These total losses are almost entirely from loss of subscriptions in China because of Cataclysm's launch there in July(the first month of Q3) which were not included in the previous subscription losses.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaxien</div><div class="date">2011-11-09, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still don't see what all the panic is about. Yeah, Blizzard lost approximately 14% of their subscriber base in the last year or so. You have to realize though that in this day and age, when you consider the bar that WoW set for MMORPGs, they were bound to hit a wall where they either can't continue to hold the attention of old players, or can't come up with enough new ideas to lure in new players. There is a point where you peak with your target market. Combine that with the uprising of other MMORPGs injecting themselves into the market, having been able to study WoW's successes(and failures) and hopefully learn from it all, and you have the ability to draw people away from WoW.<br />
<br />
That being said, when you consider that WoW still has 10.3M subscribers, that's nothing to sneeze at either. Think about it. If everyone paid the lowest payment method, which I BELIEVE equates out to an average of about $13 per month, that means that Blizzard is bringing in about $14,000,000 A MONTH.......that's well over $1.5 BILLION dollars a year....in JUST subscriptions....that doesn't include anything purchases from their store, and mobile client downloads, and paid premiums services. Yeah, $265,000,000 less a year hurts, but it is by no means killing them. Especially when you consider how long a lot of their hardware has been in service without major upgrades having to be done. Their servers are pretty self sufficient for an extended amount of time, only needing to be upgraded here and there, and even then, they don't necessarily have to replace the entire server, but more likely one or two pieces of internal hardware. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I guess I look at it this way. When SW:TOR comes out and Diablo 3 hits the shelves, that is when I would like to see the number of subscribers and how big a tumble it takes. On top of that, you have to bide your time and see if MoP has any impact whatsoever on the number of subscribers. I have spoken to many people, and their intentions are all over the map. Some intend to play SW and WoW, some plan to quit WoW altogether and go play SW, some people plan to ignore SW and continue to play WoW. It is all preference. I play WoW because I like the fantasy setting. SW:TOR doesn't appeal to me whatsoever, because I just don't like the idea of a MMORPG in space. Some people share this view with me, and some people are intrigued by the concept. Neither of these views are wrong, nor should the be perceived as such. I say play what you like, to hell with what everyone else thinks. <br />
<br />
One last comment, responding to the guy who thinks that if enough subscribers are lost, Blizzard will start to take it seriously and start putting out better quality content. That's just a big pile of poo, imo. In order for Blizzard to maintain their workforce, they have to maintain a customer base. If you think for one minute that they aren't taking a 14% hit in that base seriously, you are sadly mistaken. If you can't afford to keep the people on staff to create better content, then you can't create better content. The fact of the matter is that after 7 years, it is challenging to come up with 100% new content without the risk of changing the dynamics of the game so much so that the game stops being attractive to the people that have been around a long time. You want to change it enough so that you can attract new players without pissing your loyal customers off, because they have the most time invested in the game already, and those are the people that are most likely to stick around and keep food on the tables of Blizzard's employees. Who is most likely the most important, the guy with a dozen max level toons scattered throughout the world who has been playing since launch, or this new guy that thinks the Pokemon feature of MoP is &quot;totally rad, dude!&quot; Think about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you misunderstand the scope.<br />
The next-successful MMORPG would be Dark Age of Camelot, and that kept ~400k subscribers at it's high, and stayed at &gt;100k for a little under 4 years.<br />
Compare that to WoW, and while the numbers are concerning, they got a long long long way to drop until they'd no longer be #1. I doubt they're worried, especially with D3 and HotS coming out and them working on a next-gen MMO in the background.</div></div><hr />

What a reason not to buy them. I don't see the annual pass as being all that big of an implement. I'm sure a lot of people are lured by that &quot;free shite&quot; by Blizzard, but the majority of its appeal is probably to people who already planned on paying the 12 months. Not saying it won't save face, even a little. The bitter sulkers of my ilk just see it as a cheap marketing technique to claw down subscribers.<br />
<br />
I feel as though I'm obliged to say that the best generations of WoW players are leaving. Yes. The vanilla-loving, &quot;whining elite&quot; that were originally charmed by the dynamic feel of the game. Now, WoW is a model of how I except D3 to be. Linear as shit and unbelievably forgiving.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but math is math. 10.3 Million subscribers times, oh, let's say $14/month on average, since some pay monthly, and some pay semi-annually, that still equals about $144,000,000 income per month from subscriptions. Yes, that is about $432,000,000 per quarter of revenue, but that is ONLY from game subscriptions. That does not include any premium services, such as faction changes, name changes, race changes, server transfers, or mobile armory subscriptions. Don't forget merchandise from the Blizzard store as well.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, yeah, losing subscribers means less money coming in, but you can't tell me that the $2 Billion dollars they are grossing is not paying the bills, paying the employees, and still isn't leaving them with huge profit margins. Even if your calculations were right, which I am firmly disagreeing with you and saying they are not, you are saying that they are &quot;ONLY&quot; netting between $280 and $320 MILLION dollars a year as a PROFIT. You realize a profit is ALL of your revenue minus ALL of your expenses. I wish I could net a quarter billion dollars a year after losing 14% of my customer base. While I am sure that Blizzard is taking the hit in subscribers seriously, I highly doubt they are anywhere near panic mode.</div></div><hr />

I am not saying WOW is dying... god knows no fanboy wants to hear that... but WOW is dying... you could and did make excuse after excuse for the 900k over the last 9 months... god knows I have read every excuse in the book... add to it another 800k for the past 3 months and your still gonna make excuses? <br />
<br />
Get real and face facts... there is no other game out that could be used as an excuse for WOW's failure over the last year... So 1.7 million over the last calendar year with no real comp... Aion and Rift are both a joke IMO... Star wars coming out will take another mill... diablo will take another mill... your looking at 2 mill+ over the next year just because WoW sucks cock... Deal with the reality fanboys... numbers dont lie even if you try and make it because China doesn't like Cata... pfftt... w/e we all know and see the truth...

WoW Lost 800k Subscribers, down to 10.3M Activision Blizzard latest earning call revealed that World of Warcraft lost another 800,000 subscribers last quarter, following the loss of 300k subscribers announced last quarter and 600k loss from the quarter before that. This brings us to 1.7 million subscribers lost in the last 3 quarters. ... Most of the subscriptions were lost in China. <br />
Those were more or less Morhaime's words ... he didn't really said what &quot;MOST&quot; means: 790k, 600k, 400k or what ?! He didn't explained the numbers at all I might say. He said again that there is not enough end game content and that Cata is hard. <br />
<br />
He said they have Mists of Pandaria in the making that will bring back players ... that the panda theme will appeal for casuals. For the hardcore they will focus on the conflict between Alliance and Horde. He seemed to make a big deal out of the &quot;Annual Pass&quot; for making players stick with the game and not quit in even more numbers once Diablo 3 is out. They have more for WoW: <br />
He have other agressive marketing plans for the coming months for World of Warcraft but we are not ready to share details yet <br />
<br />
They bid on Brazil to get more subs back to WoW, similar like China I guess. <br />
<br />
On the Q&amp;A: They don't provide forecast on subscriber numbers of WoW. Morhaime putting hope on Mists of Pandaria, which is a deja-vu to me, same thing he said about Cataclysm and the world rehash. They &quot;plan to be very aggresive for the end of the year&quot;: 4.3 in december against SWTOR release ? They hope they will win back players &quot;on the normal increase in december&quot;, but again, they will be against SWTOR. <br />
<br />
The &quot;atleast two releases&quot; means: new full games, Diablo 3 and another one. <br />
Overall these conference calls are too optimistic in my view, the numbers say &quot;profit&quot; but a declining in profit margins and Morhaime seemed to dodge the WoW decline subs numbers subject.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we all know theyre all waiting for Guild Wars 2, im fairly sure that blizzard has noted arenanet/ncsoft under Threats of their SWOT analysis, henche why the stuff they come up with are already implemented as part of the game in newer MMO's or announced MMO's .<br />
there's nothing wrong with World of Warcraft in itself, but its a bit too obvious Blizzard didnt make any use of their innovation they introduced in 2004 in Vanilla and from there just kept developing, rather than being innovative. <br />
<br />
Other MMO's might not go as deep, but i think everyone is just simply tired of this game by the lack of innovation and the overenthusiasm to change and develop the game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocd3bdcd5cd3</div><div class="date">2011-11-09, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the loss of Chinese subscribers is a bit more than &quot;they didn't like Pandaren&quot;. <br />
<br />
China has a very fascinating mass-bubble economy going on right now. The demographic of persons who play WoW in China are possibly those of a sub-middle class who are being literally sacrificed for the rising GDP of the country, and likely are unable to afford playing an MMO anymore.What I'm saying is that, yes, WoW lost subscribers but they didn't lose them to any other oncomming or pre-existing MMO.<br />
<br />
This is why the note was made in the earnings call: wealthy investors already understand the volatile global markets going on, and this is a subtle warning for those who are understanding China's economic climate behind the hype of China becoming THE economic superpower to invest in.<br />
<br />
Obviously since this is to the end of Sept. MoP wasn't even announced.</div></div><hr />

This game is more than 5 years old. Nobody would read such things about a guy that played chess for five years. People would say &quot;Aww, he is bored by the game&quot; and not: &quot;chess needs new rules. NAO!&quot;<br />
<br />
This game will die - at this speed in a couple of years, making it ten years old. Or 8 to 9, who knows. Wow, this is a real problem. Not a war, not a financial crisis, not to get hit by a truck on the highway. Phew, better worrying. Now. And invest time in future MMOs.</div></div><hr />
