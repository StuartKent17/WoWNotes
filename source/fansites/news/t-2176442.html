Providing Feedback<br />
I poked fun at it because I felt it was worth calling out that that's not a good plan for getting your feedback across. I assume that community managers and others reviewing the forum generally won't look kindly on someone posting 23 times in a row (and rightly so). Beyond this I'm going to leave their job to them though; I'm just here to talk about feedback and this forum.<br />
<br />
Viewing this forum (or any other) as a contest for who most deserves a blue response is never going to give a satisfying result. Chiefly because that's not how we actually use the forums. We use it as a place to sift through a very large number of posts and try to collect actionable feedback reasonably efficiently. We're primarily reading more than posting, and what we care about is clear, specific, and non-hyperbolic feedback. I don't have a full-blown thesis on how to best do that, but a few thoughts I have regularly while reading:<br />
<br />
--Narrower issues/discussions are better. If you say something specific about something that goes wrong or feels bad whilst trying to use an ability, we tend to take notice regardless of whether there's an immediate result. On the flip side; the problem of large-scale DPS balance is virtually always intractable on a forum thread.<br />
<br />
--Talking about any outcome you desire besides more power for your character is virtually a requirement for feedback to mean much (everyone always wants more power for their character).<br />
<br />
--Change may not happen quickly. One requirement for healthy long-term communication is being able to have interactions other than &quot;we're changing this right away.&quot; Sometimes (often) we're not changing something right away even if we don't like it--and there's nobody with a bigger list of things to potentially improve than us.<br />
<br />
Part of having this forum, as I've mentioned, is trying to post a little more on our thinking and philosophy (instead of only on immediate action). We like open communication and feedback because of how valuable it is for us to have as much insight as possible into what's happening with players (at its core, &quot;feedback&quot; is about telling us good or bad things that happened to you while playing--the closer you are to that concept, the better it usually is). And both us and players being able to get more out of it also requires that any communication be taken for what it is, not as an invitation to fight with us or with each other about which topics get a response.

Druid Class Mount<br />
Here's what I think is going to happen - druid flight form isn't going to be affected by the broken isles speed boost, other flying mounts are. Just like how ground travel form isn't affected by the broken isles speed boost but normal ground mounts are. Really hope I'm wrong here, waiting to be pleasantly surprised.<br />
Good news! The Archdruid's Lunarwing Form operates like a shapeshift in terms of benefits (instant cast, immune to polymorph, etc.) but also counts as an additional mount in your mount journal.<br />
<br />
As for the second question, the movement speed bonus from Broken Isles Pathfinder I does not apply to flying speed, but druid Travel Form does benefit from the ground movement speed bonus in 7.2 (and this should be active on PTR)!<br />
<br />
Can people mount us in flight form? Please Muffinus. It's all I've ever dreamed of<br />
You can, indeed, carry others on your back in this form. Enjoy! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/801390-druid-72-mount-travel-questions/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753109554?page=1#20))<br />

Holy Priest PvP Talents<br />
We really like the idea about resetting Spirit of Redeemer's cooldown upon death. We just snuck it in for 7.2!<br />
<br />
As for Spirit of Redeemer, we agree that talent competes a little too directly with Ray of Hope in what it's trying to do. It'll likely get some changes... eventually.

Affliction and Demonology Feedback<br />
Bear with me. I get that the idea is for various specs to excel in different situations. That's one way to approach the class design. But, let's assume, for argument's sake, that there are 3 ways to build an affliction lock, due to talents (similarly for demo or destro).<br />
<br />
Why would you use the talents to create the &quot;specialization&quot; inside of the spec itself, and largely let the spec determine how the class feels? Meaning, why couldnt each warlock spec have excellent single target, &quot;cleave&quot; or aoe dps, (via various talent builds) and let the player pick which spec he wants to play based on how that rotation feels? <br />
<br />
I happen to LOVE using MG and tunneling. I like for cleave i can throw out a few agonys, throw out a seed, and then go back to channeling on a high priority mob. I do not want to manage 2-3 dots on multiple targets very much in order to do relevant dps. I'm worried that because I'm affliction, you'll eventually revert to me being completely &quot;meh&quot; on single target if I'm not multi-dotting. I hate that idea. <br />
<br />
Help me understand why achieving that (equal balance via talents between given specs) is difficult to do from a balance standpoint? Why does one spec have to be the &quot;single target&quot; spec, one a multi-dot, one a havoc.... etc?<br />
<br />
Please don't kill what I've come to really like about affliction. I've seen the &quot;de-homogenization&quot; at work recently (with holy paladin design from the WoD rotational style) and I just think the &quot;variety&quot; is better served in talents than it is changing the spec design every few months.<br />
The answer is probably that there should be some mix of both (quite possibly a mix we're still trying to settle into the right place, given that Legion greatly expanded the use of spec-specific talents that change your rotation). Both of the following are good things to have happen in the game:<br />
<br />
1) You really like the MG playstyle, and feel good when you're using it well, and feel extra good when that happens when it's also the highest-DPS talent for the situation.<br />
<br />
2) A fight happens to be perfect for Affliction (perhaps that should be sustained multi-DoT, but it doesn't matter right now what it is, just that some situation is) and you feel good as you shine on that fight, including making your raidmates of other specs/class temporarily jealous of you.<br />
<br />
#2 is more controversial I believe, but it remains true even in a world with some nontrivial barrier to swapping specs. Yes, one complication is the fact that some players will always care enough about min/maxing to put in the effort to overcome the barrier and play the &quot;best&quot; spec as often as possible. That's okay though; in fact, it's good to have it be up to players to make that choice of whether it's worth it for them. In 7.2, we're even reducing some of the oft-cited barriers to playing multiple specs through changes to the artifact and legendary systems.<br />
<br />
Without delving deeper into those issues, the point is that if you see your Demonology friend doing more DPS than you on one fight, and you do more DPS than him on the next fight, that is a fundamentally good experience to have players coming across in the game. It adds texture and meaning to the choice of specs. And on a more basic level, feeling sometimes slightly advantaged, and sometimes slightly envious of what someone else can do, is a much richer experience than feeling neither of those.

The new class challenge artifact appearances, was wondering do you need to do them for each spec or just one to unlock all.<br />
The challenges are intended to show your mastery of each specialization. You'll need to unlock each appearance separately. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/834195242706284544))<br />

Can I get some clarification on the Survival hunter 2pc, Some say its 3x and other say its 6x your mastery<br />
With the Survival T19 2pc, the total chance for your Flanking Strike to trigger Hunting Companion is 6x your base mastery. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/834179027019575296))<br />

That's sounds super cool and all, but it's still a lackluster mount. <br />
Selling a turt as &quot;crafted in the darkest corners of the void by the all devouring Demon of Gluttony, Turtionius swallowed whole armies at once that led to engineering the Turt of Turtionius on the blood-spat Porcelain Toilet of Doomed Souls&quot; still makes it just a turt, no matter how cool the backstory. <br />

Paladins and Warlocks beg for several expansions for updated class mounts. They're finally getting what they begged for but still find reasons to complain.<br />

<br />
I can agree with that. Would be nice to have some kind of a better animation for it at least. Though I have no better idea of my own so not much I can personally complain about.<br />
<br />
It has to fly though. Otherwise people would complain that other class mounts can fly.</div></div><hr />

It woulda been fine if we got updated class mounts earlier on since u say we've been asking for them for years....but when they update our class mounts look at the same time they give shaman an insane looking mount, maybe best looking mount ingame, it kinda just doesnt feel right...pally/lock/mage all got shafted on these mounts and that sucks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some people feel the shaman mount is hideous. It's all subjective.<br />
<br />
As far as your logic for redoing the mount long before this, if they did the warlock mount then they would have to do the pally mount or people would complain. Even then you'd still have people complaining that those classes already had mounts and other classes should have gotten some love (which is what is happening now, all classes getting something rather than just 2 getting something after they already had that very thing). Disregarding the complaining, if you put employees on the task of remodeling those mounts, you're taking them away from other tasks. That might be an extra month that we don't see a new raid or dungeon because warlocks and paladins wanted to cry about their mounts not being redone.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, you can't please everyone. Blizzard has limited staff and limited time. They do what they feel is best use of their time at that given time and sometimes they're right and sometimes their not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
run like dogs? i dont know, i looked up some videos of horses running and they look the same... <br />
i compared the running animation of the mount to a few horse running gifs and it matched<br />
comparing it to a dog is just false, dogs when they run fast and have long legs like to run, both legs at the same time, front legs push as back legs lift, then back legs push well front legs lift, so on so forth<br />
<br />
the only thing i see is the mounts legs move much slower, but having them go faster would look rather akward<br />

can you show me a gif of a horse that doesent match? im looking and they look rather similar<br />
<br />
also idk if you guys know but doing PERFECT animations, specially something like a horse is very very dificult<br />
and i dont think blizzard wants to send a few animators to a week long vacation to study horses like the creators of shadow of the collosus did<br />

why would people bitch about that mount ??? Do you need to do a lore quest for it ? Do you need to spend resource materials for it ? It's about a very unique class mount.

What i do start to begin to hate around here is , if you are having a subjective discussion about something , it start to begin a so call bitch war againt's wow... i play wow because i like to , and still do ... but i have subjective difference that i don't like what they do. But i need to keep still or else i'm a wow bitcher. Even though i still like the game.. :confused:<br />

you mean the warlocks in the discord? yeah... an extreme minority, do you think a majority of warlock players are in the discord?<br />
ok yeah i would love to see a accurate statistic after this mount has been out for long enough for everyone to get it, to see who uses the dreadsteed at 110 who has the mount, compared to people who use this mount<br />
<br />
also what? yes in the top one they are standing on the ground... but no the horsemen of the Apocalypse's horses run through the sky...<br />

You can argue all you like, the way horses move in WoW is just factually incorrect. There used to be mounts with proper horse animations (WOTLK Deathcharger for example) which was changed with Cataclysm for some reason.</div></div><hr />

WoW horses don't.run.like.horses. End of story. You not seeing the differences doesn't make them less of a fact, and I was poking fun at it, but it's still very much true. The cartoony nature of the game says absolutely nothing about how they animate the mounts, seeing as how there was a time when certain horse mounts DID gallop if not perfectly accurately, then at least somewhat moreso.<br />

That's a beyond silly comparison when there ARE no real dragons, come on now. As you should know, there are real horses, and it's quite possible for game creators to make horses that don't run very realistically all the same. WoW horses are one such example. The Hearthsteed however, does gallop, whilst other mounts using that same skeleton, run like the original skeleton's (Hippogryph) animations set.<br />
<br />
Not that there's anything inherently wrong with that, many other mounts don't move realistically either (boars, mammoths, worgs etc).</div></div><hr />

But it simply isn't, so your opinion doesn't factor into it... Seriously, the only thing they have in common is that their legs move. The order in which the legs move is different between the 2. The Hearthsteed moves much more true to a real horse, the warlock horse does not.</div></div><hr />

yeah no, your just lying to start shit, they are all three of them pretty much the same animation<br />
again im showing you they look the exact, or 99% the same, and you havent said WHY they dont look the same? how come they dont look the same? i am legit wondering, is there some subtle differences im not noticing?<br />

your the one making the joke that &quot;it looks like a dog its stupid&quot; and i pointed out it really doesent, it matches a real life horse very well, then said the hearthsteed matches a real horse but the lock mount doesent, i then showed you they use the same animation and you say &quot;no your stupid&quot; they look competetly different, with no examples at all<br />
<br />
its not a perfect animation, but it does look like an actual horse, not a dog</div></div><hr />

I've given you plenty of examples and linked posts and videos and charts. Boy, you REALLY hate being wrong, don't you? <br />
It can't be explained any clearer than this; The warlock mount doesn't move its legs and body like a proper horse does when it gallops. Fact, end of story. The Hearthsteed does it more realistically than any other horse in this game, but you're not able to spot the difference so there's that.<br />
<br />
And we're not discussing those birds here, we're discussing something where YOU have denied that there's a difference, when the difference is a fact because... feels? However, if you tell me what the difference is (if any) between those birds, I'd be inclined to believe you since I don't know much about birds. I do however, know horses and their movement.<br />
<br />
Here's another post of me and other people taking note of when the original Deathcharger animations (galloping) was changed to the bog standard WoW &quot;horse&quot; animations way back when, guess I and they were all &quot;lying to start shit&quot; as well? :rolleyes:<br />

The only one &quot;starting&quot; shit here is you. I was poking fun at it to begin with (because it's a well-known fact of the game to those of us that know this shit). You're not able to spot the differences? Fine by me, but you're akin to someone ignorant about cars trying to argue that 2 engines work the exact same way despite people with know-how explaining differences between them.<br />

Let me guess, you &quot;don't see the difference&quot; here either...<br />
<br />

<br />

Drives me nuts how horribly they animate the movement of a horse. It's just so far off the mark it's not even funny.<br />
<br />
I don't have a farm (jelly) but I too would invite them to accept your invitation. :p<br />
A game which does the horse movement quite nicely (albeit a bit stiff), is Archeage, in terms of how the horses animate. As a horse-nut, I can find immense joy in seeing them move, and when an in-game horse moves realistically it takes me back to riding myself. Hard to explain it, but I suspect you understand what I'm trying to say.</div></div><hr />

The pre-3.0 animation is the closer of the 2 to accurate, but it's still pretty bad. A horse in a gallop will actually be supporting it's full weight on a single front foot during part of the stride. That never occurs in the current animation. And frankly if I had one that ran like they do right now I wouldn't keep them. The only time a horse moves with that much bounce is when it's bucking.</div></div><hr />
