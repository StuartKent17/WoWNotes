The Zandalari Troll racial ability Embrace of the Loa now requires your Zandalari troll to use the ability in front of one of the Zandalari loa shrines around Dazar'alor.

Patch 8.1.5 PTR - Darkmoon Faire Roller Coaster<br />
The Darkmoon Faire Roller Coaster functions much like the carousel, giving you the WHEE! (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/46668-whee) buff after riding it. It costs one Darkmoon Ride Ticket (https://www.wowdb.com/items/81055-darkmoon-ride-ticket).<br />

Same goes for arena, you can't choose the embrace that would suit the enemy team you are going to fight.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to the point, that since there is a 5 day CD now on it, you are kinda forced, that you benefit from said embrace at least nearly the same way on the other spec you want to play.</div></div><hr />

Bwomsamdi is litteraly 100% the Forsaken Racial: Touch of the Grave<br />

Many of the proccs seem severely low, P'aku's 4% critbuff procc, is very underwhelming contrasted to like the Void-Elves racial that has a more predictable mannerism.</div></div><hr />

- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
I'd prefer if the racials weren't combat oriented, but more about utility.<br />
Let's say Bwonsamdi gives you speed buff when you're dead, for faster corpse runs<br />
Paku lets you glide like DH<br />
Krag'wa lets you double jump<br />
Gonk lets you.. I dunno have everyone make fun that your loa is called Gonk?<br />
Kimbul - gives you out-of-combat run speed<br />
Akunda - makes you forget all your abilities till you change Loa :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what was stopping them from putting these ones on the character creation screen for launch to play immediately like those other races?<br />
<br />
Oh right nothing...... It's literally taking a feature you used to get at launch and timegating it hard. Nothing more or less. The Zandalari and KT right now are literally timegated because their unlock requirements are already in the damn game. I'd expect this kind of trash from a F2P piece of garbage. Not a sub based game.<br />
<br />
And don't even say &quot;lore&quot;. Because the lore behind unlocking them and quite frankly the unlock quests are glorified scenarios and mediocre at best.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure they'll change it by then. Mabye just by having a Loa stone in your inventory, or a toy, that can change it, with a 5 day cooldown, or any other of a million options.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much every other throughput racial works cross role. These ones do not.<br />
<br />
Your healing abilities have a chance to heal their target for 525.<br />
Your damaging abilities have a chance to cause the target to bleed for 260 over 6s. This effect stacks up to 3 times.<br />
Taking damage has a chance to grant you 393 additional Health and 66 Armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's annoying, restrictive, and badly designed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find it funny that people wan't to complain about this. What if you play a healer on an undead char? Your racial is near useless, and you don't HAVE the option to change it.<br />
<br />
The zandalari racial is great because you actually get 6 racials that you can choose from depending on what spec you primarily play. That's so much more custimizable than any other race.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I hope these are spec specific as in can pic 1 per spec. I dps raids and tank outside on same toon would suck to be locked into the dps one 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
No need - Zandalari already get to choose a racial that works best with their primary specialization (AND it can be changed) - that's a lot more than any other race can say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's too much. A 5 day cd ensures people will rarely ever change it. Raiders definitely never will otherwise it won't be off cd before the next raid day. Going to a Loa shrine is great, but the cd is too much. It should be reduced to a few hours.</div></div><hr />

Proofs again they are utterly clueless when it comes how to balance racials.<br />
<br />
The healing was already over the top OP but got slighty fixed<br />
<br />
And now they just throw in this whole go to a shrine Bs for what reason?<br />
<br />
You want to lvl a Troll ye go back to a shire if that's even possible.<br />
<br />
You wanna switch spec during mid dungeon/raid yep go to a shrine<br />
<br />
And the 5 days cd why even?<br />

The whole idea of having the ability to choose a buff is a nice touch but doing it like this completely ruins the whole experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so wrong<br />
stomeform can be usefull, though not often as a dps / healer to dispel a debuff, even bleeds on specific encounters, or just magic as a dps<br />
AP for tanks is still legit, threat/tank dmg is not useless, and some defensive spells scale with AP for tanks aswell, see ignore pain for warriors<br />
<br />
touch of the grave might not be the best, but a good healer does dmg aswell, + they have will of the forsaken, which can be good on some encounters<br />
<br />
Taurens endurence was one of the reasons tauren was the #1 dps for ww monks because of how touch of death and karma scales with hp, + a dead dps is not a dps ;) (+2% crit dmg)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bloodfury is still useful for tanks. Tanks still deal damage and need to out threat DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dwarf's stoneform is pretty useless to non-tanks. <br />
<br />
Stoneform is not the throughput racial for Dwarfs, Might of the Mountain is. Also is useful for healers dps and tanks.<br />
<br />
Might of the Mountain	Dwarf Racial<br />
Critical strike damage and healing increased by 2%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Undead's touch of the grave is useless to healers. <br />
<br />
Yes, this one is useless which is why I said most not all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tauren's endurance is useless for non-tanks. <br />
<br />
Same thing as Dwarf racial.<br />
<br />
Brawn	Tauren Racial<br />
Critical strike damage and healing increased by 2%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You have &quot;universal&quot; 5% crit that fits every spec and is in line with other racials. <br />
<br />
It's not 5% passive crit, its a chance to get 4% crit for 12 seconds which is hilariously bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can ALSO choose more specialized and potent racials. Other races can't choose &quot;general or more specialized&quot;. How the fuck is having choice &quot;restrictive and badly designed&quot;? Not OP enough for you? <br />
<br />
The specialized racials are fine and would be pretty cool actually - if there was no 5day cooldown and needing to be in a specific spot to activate them. The problem is that the illusion of choice is so annoying. If they had just gotten 1 racial that wasn't that great I wouldn't be bothered about it but the fact that they set 6 out in front of you but realistically you can only use 1. Nobody is ever going to say &quot;Hold on let me swap to my tank racial for this M+&quot; and then do it because O gee golly gosh its raid day and I don't have my DPS racial. Cool system!</div></div><hr />

The zandalari racial is great because you actually get 6 racials that you can choose from depending on what spec you primarily play. That's so much more custimizable than any other race.<br />
<br />
Not true, disc priests deal damage.<br />

Fits to the expansion. Min maxing again. No creativity. No risk. At least leaning left and right to catch something should have been possible. But no...<br />

I've been waiting for my zandalari since the launch. The fact they are being patched in later and still haven't is frustrating. And I understand wanting to have the kultiran ready but why on Earth were they so unfinished? Blizzard couldn't have expected people to not want to play as them. My first thought after seeing the trolls as a feature was that kultiran would be playable as well. <br />
Even the original plan was that they joined us after we settled things for them. Now granted, horde side, we failed at stopping the seal from being destroyed but we did clean house for them. And alliance side, it makes no sense that the kultiran aren't part of the alliance until after the siege of zuldazar. Alliance characters fix everything for the kultiran. Not just that they supplied the boats for an attack on the zandalari.<br />
This is all without mentioning that there are zandalari NPCs titled horde captives. <br />
A neat less frustrating thing would to have the quest unlock for the allied races at the end of the mythic race as a way to get people involved and excited. For all the playerbase not just the raiders.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it's maybe an illusion of choice every 5 days but for other races you don't have the choice at all. Nobody is ever going to say &quot;Hold on let me pay a swap race for this M+&quot;.<br />
<br />
And like you say on pretty every other races you still can use racials cross specs. And it's still true for embraces.<br />
<br />
Embrace of Krag'wa - Give you armor and hp still. Less effective for healer and dps but fairly decent.<br />
Embrace of Kimbul - Your damaging abilities have a chance to cause the target to bleed. Less effective for healer and tank but still useable.<br />
Embrace of Bwonsamdi - Your damaging abilities have a chance to deal Shadow damage and heal you for 100% of the damage done. Less effective for healer and tank but still useable and maybe great on some of them.<br />
Embrace of Paku - Your abilities have a chance to grant you 5% critical strike for 0 sec. Totally cross specs<br />
Embrace of Gonk - Increase movement speed by 5%. Totally cross specs<br />
Embrace of Akunda - Your healing abilities have a chance to heal their target. Less effective for dps and tank but still proc, and if you pikk this one you probably are a main healer and have an heal as dps and tank spec.<br />
<br />
On this race you have the opportunity for free every 5 days to optimize your char for the spec you want to play. Will be a less effective for others specs, but it's pretty like every other races. And in top of that you still have a perfectly cross spec crit proc.<br />
<br />
The only down side can be uptime/damage/heal/... for now it's still on PTR.
