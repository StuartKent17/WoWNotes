I didn't cover the US and EU first level 85 characters when they happened 2 days ago, this is mostly because leveling in Cataclysm is fairly easy and the ranking mostly depended on what realms went up first. <br />
<br />
However, it's pretty clear that now that we have near-final rankings for US and EU realms (thanks to WoWProgress (http://www.wowprogress.com/char_level/)), one character leveled much faster than the others: Forscience (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Neptulon&amp;n=Forscience) played by the lovely Athene. He posted a short video to explain how he did it, see below.<br />

Cataclysm Hotfixes - Updated Dec. 8<br />
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br />
<br />
December 8<br />
General<br />
<br />
Guilds no longer receive guild experience when earning guild achievements. You can read more about this on our forums.<br />
If a guild maxed their experience gains for the day, subsequent tallying of individual members’ weekly and total experience gained was not always properly being saved and stored. This has been corrected.<br />
The achievements Heroic: Lost City of the Tol'vir Guild Run, Heroic: Shadowfang Keep Guild Run, and Baradin Hold Guild Run are now properly awarded and show up in the Guild Achievement window.<br />
Corla will now always drop an item and the Red Winter Hat does not replace her regular loot drop. It's because she cares.<br />
Specific mounts, when used in Eastern Kingdoms, were not receiving the appropriate movement speed modifiers between land and ground. This has been corrected.<br />
Players can enter and finish Wintergrasp or Tol Barad even if no players from the opposing faction are queued.<br />
Players are now able to acquire &quot;A Winter Veil Gift&quot; for 2010 if they had completed &quot;A Winter Veil Gift&quot; in 2009.<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
<br />
Several items which drop from bosses in Cataclysm five-player dungeons have been correctly reclassified so that the intended classes can roll Need when in a Looking For Dungeon group.<br />
Rock Borers no longer award reputation when killed in The Stonecore.<br />
Evolved Twilight Zealots killed by Raz in Blackrock Caverns no longer award experience if tapped by players.<br />
Players are again provided a spectral flying mount while in spirit form if killed in Ahn'Qiraj: The Fallen Temple.<br />
The Tamed Tol'vir Prowlers in Lost City of the Tol'vir award much less experience when killed.<br />
Players can now use Wind Tunnels while in combat, returning them to Siamat's platform in Lost City of the Tol'vir.<br />
Deep Murloc Drudges in Throne of the Tides no longer grant experience when killed.<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Players are no longer able to refund an alternate-cost item if they level up during its refund timer.<br />
Stormrider's Cover was requiring an incorrect class token to purchase from vendors. This has been fixed. Until a patch is applied, the Stormrider's Cover will still list a Crown of the Forlorn Protector being a required currency, however, it can be correctly purchased with a Crown of the Forlorn Vanquisher.<br />
The Filet Knife quest reward from &quot;Something Edible&quot; in Vashj'ir is a caster weapon and now has spell power. So sensible!<br />
The on-use effect from Tosselwrench's Shrinker is no longer counting as an elixir buff. Additionally, no extra ranged attack power or other stats are granted.<br />
Eastern Plaguelands quest reward trinkets no longer have on-use effects that grant ranged attack power.<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Fishing skill gains were increasing too rapidly past 500 skill and have been adjusted.<br />
The tradeskill nodes were too dense in Deepholm and Twilight Highlands for Mining and Herbalism. Several have been removed.<br />
Mining nodes were too dense in the entrance cave to Uldaman and have been thinned out.<br />
Players are no longer able to use a Lifegiving Seed while shapeshifted and receive the appropriate error message when attempting to do so. Additionally, the effect is canceled when entering combat.<br />
Enchant Weapon - Mending no longer gives haste when it procs on attacks or spells. Now, it just gives the proper heal.<br />
Creating a Runescroll of Fortitude II now correctly grants skill-ups.<br />
<br />
Quests &amp; Creatures<br />
<br />
All existing guard posts in the world (e.g. Goldshire, Azure Watch, Bloodhoof, etc.) now properly spawn level 85 capital city guards.<br />
Quests for the Hydraxian Waterlords have been properly deprecated.<br />

<br />
Players no longer receive experience from killing Mercurial Droplets.<br />
Deepstone Elementals now spawn more quickly.<br />
Captive Quartz Rocklings in Lorthuna's Gate now respawn more quickly.<br />

<br />

<br />
Kezan<br />
<br />
Both the Rope Ladder and Last Chance Yacht Boarding Mortar objects will now sparkle while on the quest &quot;Life Savings&quot;. Now with more sparkles!<br />
<br />
Mount Hyjal<br />
<br />
Players in a party on the quest &quot;Black Heart of Flame” are all now able to loot the Black Heart of Thol'embaar after killing Thol’embaar, because it's only fair.<br />
Blazebound Elementals no longer reward experience when Flameseer's Staff is used on them.<br />
Players will now receive the error message &quot;You are in the wrong zone&quot; when trying to use Spawn of Smolderos outside of Mount Hyjal.<br />
Twilight Flamecallers and Twilight Overseers now respawn more quickly.<br />
Players no longer get attacked by guards when landing in Nordrassil with a hostile player targeted. It was a rather rude introduction to Mount Hyjal really.<br />
Twilight Stormwakers now respawn more quickly for the quest &quot;Slash and Burn&quot;.<br />
Flame Ascendants needed for the quest &quot;Might of the Firelord&quot; now respawn more quickly.<br />
<br />

Creatures in Neferset City needed for the quest &quot;Bleeding the Enemy&quot; now respawn more quickly.<br />
Players will now correctly switch phases after turning in the quest &quot;Gobbles!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vashj'ir<br />
<br />
Players will now be in the correct phase with Wavespeaker Valoren after completing the quest &quot;Communing with the Ancient&quot;. Seeing ghost question marks on the mini-map is no fun for anyone.<br />
The Deepfin Scrounger Anchor Attack! now only roots players for 5 seconds, down from 20 seconds.<br />
The damage of the Devious Great-Eel is now correctly reduced if a player does not immediately engage the eel in combat after the Eel-Splosive Device is triggered while on the quest &quot;Here Fishie Fishie 2: Eel-Egg-Trick Boogaloo&quot; (Horde) or &quot;The Brothers Digsong 2: Eel-Egg-Trick Boogaloo&quot; (Alliance).<br />
Smuggler's Scar now has two guard posts, up from one, and Deepmist Grotto has one guard post, up from none. In addition, Cavern Crawlers are now immune to crowd control effects. Even ganking should have its limits.<br />
Players are no longer able to retain the 450% swim speed increase from the Abyssal Seahorse through devious, devious means.<br />
Earthmender Duarn's yell is now only visible to the player interacting with him for the quest &quot;Making Contact&quot;.<br />

There were instances where Duarn and Erunak weren't always spawning in the event for the quest &quot;Nespirah&quot; which have been fixed.<br />
Players of the opposite faction can no longer kill the lures for the Seahorses. It's just mean and wrong. And mean.<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

Running Wild<br />
Running Wild behaves essentially like a mount, and, while cosmetically different, it carries the same limitations. I don't think further improvements to the ability are currently on the table. <br />
<br />
Guild Level 2<br />
Level 2 is possible.<br />
<br />
The cap unlocks every night around 3am. The game released at midnight on Monday, giving guilds approximately three hours to hit cap, which many bigger or more active guilds were able to. So effectively this is Day 3 on the guild progression calendar, even though the first day was only three hours long. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/141741/lvl-2-guilds-already-blues-whats-going-on))<br />
<br />
Any chance we'll see new servers anytime soon?<br />
We'll continue evaluating overall population as we monitor how these transfers progress. My personal guess is no, not before the new year, but that's a complete guess. We'll see how these go. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/141786/free-character-moves-available))<br />

Official Forums - Character Image FAQ<br />
As many of you have already discovered, one of the focal points of the new World of Warcraft community site is, well...you! Not only do you have a variety of controls at your fingertips, but you're now represented by unique 3D renders of your in-game characters. These new character images will appear in your Armory profile, in the character card once you're logged in, and whenever you post a comment or reply.<br />
<br />
A number of players have been asking for more information about these 3D renders, so we've put together an FAQ to explain how they work and how they're created.<br />
<br />
Q. How are the character images featured on the new community site generated?<br />
A. We created an image rendering platform (which we'll refer to as a static renderer) that uses game data to render 3D images of your character.<br />
<br />
Q. How many images are rendered for a given character?<br />
A. We currently render four different images:<br />
<br />
An Armory profile image<br />
An Armory inset image<br />
An avatar image<br />
And a character card image<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. When are these images rendered?<br />
A. Whenever a character logs out of the game, a request is automatically sent to the static renderer for a new set of website images. These requests are processed in the order they are received and will typically be completed within 3 to 5 minutes. During peak gaming hours, however, when character populations can change rapidly, it may take longer for your character images to update and appear on the community site.<br />
<br />
Q. Why doesn’t my character show the same pose that I have set for the old Armory?<br />
A. Currently, we're only rendering characters in preset poses. Following the final launch of the Armory, though, we're considering allowing characters to set positions and animations through Adobe® Flash® or a similar site component. We'll provide more information as the development process continues.<br />
<br />
Q. Why are my item enchant effects not displaying?<br />
A. The image rendering platform does not currently support particle effects, so this may cause some minor inconsistencies between how your character appears in-game and on the community site -- including the display of item enchant effects.<br />
<br />
Q. My avatar is just a plain silhouette? What gives?<br />
A. If your character avatar is displaying as a generic silhouette, this typically means one of two things:<br />
<br />
Your selected character is under level 10.<br />
You have not recently played the selected character.<br />
<br />
<br />
If your character is above level 9, be sure to log into the character and then back out. This should queue a request for the static renderer and allow your character images to update appropriately.<br />
<br />
Q. Okay. I logged into my character and then back out, but neither my profile image nor my avatar has updated. What now?<br />
A. If you logged out during peak gaming hours, keep in mind that it may take a while for your new image to render. Check back in few hours and your character images should be refreshed.<br />
<br />
Q. What if I want to use a bank alt or some other character that isn't level 10 yet? Am I stuck with the silhouette?<br />
A. If a character is under level 10, it will only receive a default silhouette avatar to be used on the forums as well as in page comments. Consider this a motivation to level that character, or an opportunity to remain dark and mysterious.<br />
<br />
Q. Why does my death knight have a silhouette of a human? My death knight isn't human.<br />
A. Typically, default silhouettes are based off of race, not class. Death knights are a special case, however, as we provide their avatars a custom class background. Because of this, until an image is rendered for a death knight, the death knight silhouette will default to human.<br />
<br />
Q. What if I want a special pose, item, or background to appear in my character's image. Is that possible?<br />
A. We're unable facilitate one-off requests or custom renders. You can still customize how your character appears on the community site by using things like holiday items and lower-level quest rewards, however. Get creative -- you may be surprised at the results!<br />
<br />
Q. What if there appears to be something wrong with my character images?<br />
A. If you believe you've encountered a possible issue with the website, you can submit a report in the Website Bug Report forum. Before posting, though, we ask that you please use the integrated search function located in the upper right-hand corner of the screen to check to see if your issue has already been reported by another player.<br />
<br />
Q. Where I can leave feedback?<br />
A. If you would like to provide feedback on the website or recommend additional features and/or functionality, please visit the Website Features Request forum. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Anyone complaining that he didn't level &quot;properly&quot; because he didn't &quot;see the content&quot; is a bit ridiculous. He saw the content because he played beta, we all saw the content, he's going to see the content on his alt, and his second alt, and his third alt, and his fourth fifth sixth seventh and eighth alt. Leveling never changes, he's not missing out on anything and neither would you if you decide to level with friends to 85 in 5 hours by mob tagging. You don't get world firsts by taking your time to smell the roses, you get world first through efficiency, no more and no less.</div></div><hr />

For example, if you look at US-Cenarius, the number one player listed is NOT who got server first 85. He was server first druid, but not server first over all. You can check his achievements to verify (according to wowprogress, Drans - but no server first 85 FoS as you can see.) The first place was a paladin - I don't remember the name actually but it doesn't show up on wowprogress at all.<br />
<br />
So the list appears to not be accurate.</div></div><hr />

Incorrect, I saw the guy get server first achieve because i was online at the time.

I have to agree here. I mean, I know it's a very small group of people who are already raiding, and those that are rushed to 85, and those that did were probably in the Beta so they basically have had practice for at least 2 months already on this content. That all being said, I'm just... stunned at those numbers. I joked with my hubby we'd see all raid content done by somebody by next Tuesday. May be a possibility...<br />
Hey, it'll all still be new to me when I go in and enjoy it. I'm not complaining, I'm not whining, I'm just shocked that they're blasting through this so fast.<br />

Just because Blizzard fixed something they obviously overlooked and he used it before they fixed it doesn't mean he should be banned...<br />
<br />
With that logic everyone playing SPriest right now is exploiting because we know Blizzard is going to fix them, and therefore all players should be banned and have their levels reset because they are using a &quot;broken&quot; mechanic to their advantage.<br />

There's nothing wrong with people finding loopholes and using them to their advantage...he did the research to find it and clearly not many other people stumbled across the same thing so he deserves the credit.<br />

One thing is saying &quot;Yay, i did it, thanks to these people&quot;, but then turning the entire video into one fucking commercial for his &quot;science project&quot;, which has no relation to the world first, is just disgusting.

You have no idea who he is do you? &quot;Athene&quot; is an act, nothing more. Do you have any idea what him, Tania, or the rest of the group does with iPower? Its a great thing.

&quot;Called&quot; an exploit? That's positively ridiculous, and is most definitely cheating, and can, in no way, be called the method of an honorable player.<br />
<br />
<br />
It actually really isn't. The whole Athenelol is a fictional character created and played by Bachir Boumaâza. That guy is a genius in oh so many ways. Not to mention he is a weird but brilliant political activist. =&gt; wikipedia.org/wiki/MovieLOL<br />
<br />
Reading the wikipedia article doesn't do much to improve him or his character in my eyes. I only see him as, honestly, a huge troll. He meets the criteria for one. I've never seen an example of where he would act outside the realm of &quot;trolling&quot; and, suffice to say, I'm not impressed... From what I can recall of the torture I recall as watching a number of his videos to see if I was simply missing something and just did not understand ... he's someone who purposely and deliberately starts an argument in a manner which attacks others on a forum, or something similar, without in any way listening to the arguments proposed by his or her peers. He will spark of such an argument via the use of ad hominem attacks (i.e. 'you're nothing but a fanboy' is a popular phrase) with no substance or relevence to back them up as well as straw man arguments, which he uses to simply avoid addressing the essence of the issue. I have an issue with actions like this, and generally BEING like this because it's poor sport in debate/conversation, and usually leaves me frustrated that someone willfully, and blatantly ignores possibly factual evidence of things... :(<br />
<br />
<br />
As someone said already earlier. US gets raid content generally earlier than EU, but EU still has most world firsts. So I really don't think it matters. You can also do a comparison of the total time spent from 80-85 from launch.<br />
<br />
Consider also that this is a game by an AMERICAN company. I don't see how it would be an odd concept for the country of the game's origin to be the people getting it first. Sure, if EU can compete, and get their world firsts in good time, power to them.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I really don't get all the excitement about any of these World/Server Firsts. All it's about it seems is having a lot of other characters (either from multiboxing/having other players do it) kill mobs you tag at some spot where there's a lot of them and they respawn quickly.

I don't see anything special about the way he leveled- I mean 99% of us are not gonna have a bunch of friends kill stuff while we tag. He didn't do it the normal way, so whoever did it without doing anything special is the true World First. <br />
<br />
Same thing he did last expansion, cept this time &quot;legal&quot; because it wasn't in an instance and he wasn't cutting out the group experience. I mean if it makes so many people happy, great...But how did this really help most people? <br />

They've been &quot;play testing&quot; (read: Practicing) these bosses for months. It's normal mode. They're the best in the world. I'd be shocked if they didn't have them down this fast.</div></div><hr />

Ohhh i know they were all in beta and know these bosses inside and out, but it still sucks that first tier raid content will be destroyed by this Sunday. <br />

I myself am a casual raider and made it to LK but never got it do time work schedule. and most of the videos i study are from these guys.<br />

So GRATZ to all the current top raid guilds well deserved and look forward to your videos. Cant WAIT to get into the new raids</div></div><hr />

How can you not see that Athene's video was merely an advertisement for himself and explained nothing of how he leveled to 85 in 5 hours (because if we didn't already know he used LOADS of other people to get it for him, then we would be naive). Take that trash off your post. If I wanted advertisements, I would go elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

I hit 85 right around 3:30 Eastern time, which would be 15:50...translated into pacific would put my character at 18:30, which is still a bit ahead of some on the top 10.

Edit: I just checked the site, it says I reached 80 at 20:31, must be calculated by a different time zone than i was thinking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With that logic everyone playing SPriest right now is exploiting because we know Blizzard is going to fix them, and therefore all players should be banned and have their levels reset because they are using a &quot;broken&quot; mechanic to their advantage.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with people finding loopholes and using them to their advantage...he did the research to find it and clearly not many other people stumbled across the same thing so he deserves the credit.<br />
<br />
Besides it's not like hes got his face in the camera screaming WORLD FIRST BITCHES.<br />
<br />
No there's nothing wrong with people finding loopholes but there is something wrong with them using it to their advantage. It's called exploiting, and exploiting is against CoC. Look at what happened to the world first Yogg kill. Though I do agree these people should not be banned but a roll back on xp gained from these mobs should happen. It's the same thing they did with Guild Achievements. Guilds were being able to go beyond the level cap by getting achievements so they took away the XP from guild achievements and rolled back the xp gained. They should do the same thing with these players.</div></div><hr />

unless you see your guild on that list I wouldn't worry about it. That list is made up of the hardest of the hardcore guilds in the WORLD. I wouldn't be surprised if more than half of each guild was on the Beta, and had plenty of first hand experience with the raid prior to launch.

Athene (or whoever the freak he is) has the right to personify whatever he wants, but someone who has an act that portrays themselves as a idiot and a jerk is just as bad as someone who is actually a jerk.<br />
<br />

I also think its funny how many people are butt hurt. He did something noone else could, and it wasnt even close. Get over it.

That's the problem. People think that cause they helped him cheat his way to 85 that they'll be immortalized by him.<br />

Reality, however, is that they're just another man in a 40man raid helping another attention whore get &quot;OMG WORLD FIRSTS&quot;<br />

<br />
Lets put this into perspective:<br />
Yeah, that girl dated Bill Clinton before be was a politician and the President. That girl probably went down on him too. Does he remember her? NO.<br />
Yeah, that guy helped Athene get his 15 minutes of fame. That guy would go down on Athene if given the chance. Will Athene remember him? NO.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Also, people seriously need to get off his dick. He's just some attention whore. Give him an inch of attention and he'll take it for a mile.</div></div><hr />

Sure they have skill but is that to say there are other people that don't? Throw them an encounter they've never seen and I bet you see dozens of guilds vying for world firsts instead of 3 or 4. You already know the outcomes it's stupid. Paragon will get WF/Euro First and Premo will get US first. Because they have advanced knowledge, their world first means nothing to me at least. The only reason they didn't clear the encounter is because they were in ilvl 346 and 333 stuff instead of epics.

Normal modes, it does fit in nicely with Blizzards idea of &quot;give everyone the chance to experience the content&quot;. The top guild will probably take a bit longer on heroics. Also remember, these are the Naxxramas/OS/EoE of Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

I believe they are more likely to posses an above average IQ, and so it is a shame they (and I) game so much.</div></div><hr />

Does this work for the cloak and helmet from 85 to 86? That will be a great start for leveling once Mists hits tonight.</div></div><hr />
