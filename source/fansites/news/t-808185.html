MMO-Champion Forums and Moderators Update!<br />
The release of the expansion is behind us, it's time for a small forum announcement! <br />
<br />
1. Moderators<br />
40 moderators have been added to the forums, the goal with this addition is to ban less and have more people around to prevent problems before they happen instead of having to swing the banhammer. They've been around for a couple of days now, and if you really want to complain about someone you can always send me a well-written Private Message about the situation.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the first step to discuss a &quot;bad&quot; moderator decision is the Ban Appeal forum. However, I would like to remind everyone that the forum is only here if you think the moderator was wrong and misunderstood something, posting to explain that &quot;but it was sarcasm!&quot; after you spent 10 posts insulting someone's mother really isn't going to do anything good.<br />
<br />
2. New Forums!<br />
In an effort to clean up the General Discussions forums and keep things alive, three (well, technically 4) new forums have been created. <br />
<br />
WoW Forums<br />
<br />
Achievements (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/314-Achievements) - A lot of people are addicted to achievements, they now have a dedicated forum. <br />
<br />
<br />
Off-Topic Forums<br />
<br />
General Off-Topic (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/315-General-Off-Topic) - We finally have a dedicated Off-Topic forums, this is where anything not related to World of Warcraft goes. Obviously the moderation will be a little heavier here than on the other forums to keep things under control but I'm sure we can make something great out of it if we all decide to be nice.<br />
Fun Stuff (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/316-Fun-Stuff) - This forum is for all the fun stuff you want to post all the time, but can't because it's not related to WoW. We're talking about Photoshop contests, funny pictures, forum games, funny videos, etc ... (PS: The post count is disabled on this forum, don't bother spamming)<br />
Sports (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/317-Sports) - Everything related to sports.<br />
Cinema / TV Shows / Music / Books (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/292-Cinema-TV-Shows-Music-Books) - This isn't really a new forum, just the result of a merge of the TV Shows / Cinema and Music forum. We also added Books there for the smarter forum posters. <br />
<br />
<br />
The expanded team of moderators will be happy to see you on their forums! Now might be a good time to register (http://www.mmo-champion.com/register.php)!<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Guild Experience Change<br />
We have decided to remove the added bonus of gaining Guild Experience from Guild Achievements earned. This change will realign Guild Achievements with our philosophy held for normal Achievements, which are intended to be predominantly their own reward (barring the rare exception of special achievements that grant an additional reward.) Previously, the experience reward had been seen as an additional side bonus and not something that should have been significantly skewing the advancement of guilds. During the beta, we greatly increased leveling speed across the board and since most characters were copied from templates, guild experience from Achievements didn’t seem imbalanced. It has become clear that an imbalance does exist and should be addressed to ensure that guilds progress at the rates expected within the daily Guild Experience limits.<br />
<br />
For guilds that are currently above the normally possible experience limit, we will be readjusting it back to the expected limit once more. This will not affect Guild Reputation gains at this point in time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Hotfixes - December 7<br />
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br />
<br />
December 7<br />
General<br />

The Story So Far... Part II<br />
<br />
Heralds of Twilight<br />
<br />
As the world's races struggled for survival in the wake of the Cataclysm, details came to light concerning what—or who—had caused the disaster. Prior to the upheaval, the Fury of Earth had cryptically told Thrall that Azeroth's instability had been caused by something good that had turned unnatural. Something that wished to inflict pain and suffering on the entire world.<br />
<br />
The warning was in reference to an ancient being once known as Neltharion the Earth-Warder. Long ago, this Aspect of the black dragonflight had been granted dominion over Azeroth's earthly expanses by the benevolent titans. Yet the incessant whisperings of the Old Gods had gradually driven Neltharion insane and caused him to abandon his sacred charge. He had later revealed his treachery during the War of the Ancients by turning an immensely powerful artifact—the Dragon Soul—against his allies, annihilating nearly all of the blue dragonflight. Forever after, Neltharion would answer to a new name: Deathwing.<br />
<br />
Deathwing's murderous aim had become the subjugation of the other dragonflights, a goal left unfulfilled decades ago when he was chased into hiding by the Dragon Aspects Alexstrasza, Ysera, Nozdormu, and Malygos. In Deathwing's absence, agents of the black dragonflight continued one of his darkest schemes: creating a more powerful breed of dragon. The most promising of these vile experiments resulted in twilight dragons, malefic creatures that first appeared in the cursed and abandoned dwarven city of Grim Batol, and later within the hallowed Chamber of the Aspects.<br />
<br />
During many of these developments, Deathwing remained hidden. Rumors regarding his death circulated, leading to the assumption that his malevolent influence on Azeroth was at an end. Such was not the case. In Deepholm, the domain of earth within the Elemental Plane, Deathwing nourished his hatred of Azeroth's inhabitants, awaiting his moment to burst forth from his lair and reforge the world in flame. That fateful day—the Cataclysm—arrived shortly after Thrall's return from Outland.<br />
<br />
Deathwing's violent return did much more than sunder the lands of Azeroth; it also ruptured the boundaries of the Elemental Plane. In the aftermath, chaotic elementals emerged into the world from within the Abyssal Maw, Deepholm, the Firelands, and the Skywall. Working with Deathwing, the Twilight's Hammer cult and its twisted leader, Cho'gall, established footholds across the world with the aid of twilight dragons and enslaved elementals.<br />
<br />
Thus far, many of Azeroth's defenders have devoted themselves to combating the cult and allaying the elemental forces threatening to tear the world apart. Chief among these champions are the shaman of the Earthen Ring, including Thrall, Nobundo, and Muln Earthfury. Other Horde and Alliance heroes have also risen to the challenge, but their focus has been split due to skirmishes between the two factions.<br />
<br />
Amid the turmoil, two other beleaguered groups are striving to overcome their own hurdles. The human kingdom of Gilneas, walled off from the rest of the world for years, has come under assault by Queen Sylvanas's Forsaken. Aside from the undead, the kingdom is assailed by a debilitating curse that transforms its victims into feral wolf-beasts known as worgen. Meanwhile, a volcanic eruption on the tropical Isle of Kezan has ousted the Bilgewater Cartel and other goblins from their homes. Trade Prince Gallywix has capitalized on this moment of panic and swindled his fellow goblins out of their life savings—and their freedom—in exchange for transport off of Kezan.<br />
<br />
Much like Gilneas and the Bilgewater Cartel, other kingdoms and factions the world over face their own trials, from internal political strife to the reappearance of ancient foes. Yet there is one inescapable truth that they all share: if Deathwing and his nihilistic servants are left unopposed, the Cataclysm will pale in comparison to the chaos that lies ahead for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
A New Age Has Begun…<br />
The undead armies of the Lich King have been vanquished, and the campaign in Northrend has come to an end. Now Azeroth faces a new threat, as Deathwing the Destroyer has burst forth from the heart of the Maelstrom, unleashing widespread devastation upon Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms. As the world teeters on the brink of destruction, champions of the Alliance and Horde must embark on a quest that will take them from the World Tree to the bottom of the Great Sea to the elemental planes themselves, looking for a way to bring an end to Deathwing’s reign of ruin.<br />
<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Ganked on PvP servers<br />
What you're experiencing is world PvP on a PvP realm. I realize that it's not for everyone, but it's not something that we plan to adjust. The harsh reality is that life on a PvP realm can be difficult, and if you aren't prepared for the rigors of playing on such a realm, then it's probably in your best interest to transfer to a normal realm, or, if you cannot afford that, then consider creating a new character on a normal realm.<br />
<br />
There's never been a better time to create a fresh character. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/141299/this-is-not-fair))<br />
<br />
Realms Queues<br />
We're in the process right now of doing our quickest fix for queues which is simply raising player caps. Most realms that are seeing a high queue (once the cap changes go through) should see a substantial halving or more of their wait times.<br />
<br />
Once that's done we can then continue to evaluate and take further action as necessary. In our years of experience, free character transfers are marginally successful in that the vast majority of players hate queues, but the vast majority also aren't willing to leave their realms and guilds to avoid them. It's a solution, and one we may employ, but it's one that isn't quick and easy, and with widely varying histories of success. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/141185/extremely-dissapointed))<br />
<br />
[...] We do have another round of player cap increases going out in the next little bit but bottom line is we're most likely going to have to work toward free transfers. They're not super simple to execute so it's not something that's going to be available today.<br />
<br />
Anyway, we'll keep you informed as we go. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/141185/extremely-dissapointed))</div></div><hr />

I am aware of that, but the census of WarcraftRealms.com shows, that the average ratio of Horde to Alliance on PvP realms is 1.7 to 1. I know there are a few Alliance-dominated realms, but the majority is Horde. In the end, it doesn't matter which faction outnumbers the other one. Any server with a split of larger than 1 to 1.5 has a real problem.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. I like PvP, I like questing in the knowledge that I could be attacked any time, I even don't mind being outnumbered at times. But being outnumbered 10:1 every time all the time has nothing to do with PvP. It's more, as someone in the General channel called it yesterday, PvSittingduck.</div></div><hr />

I highly doubt that even a remotely similar number of people are going to give a crap about all those guild achievements they spent time programming into the game. There is no direct benefit for doing them other than some silly number I see in the guild interface. Less than 24 hours and they've drastically changed one of the largest features of Cataclysm.

<br />
Kind of a dick comment, it's not really world PVP if it's 20 vs 1, it's just not fun at all. I used to play on a PVP realm and this is why I left mine, but at the same time, they can easily merge servers, but I guess they would see this as a sign of weakness, as this is what all their competitors had to do after their populations dipped. <br />
<br />
They still need to nerf darkflight or just ban all racials for arena, RPM team all with sprint? yeah that will be fun! nope. time to get rid of racials in PVP in general, I know they want everyone to play worgen so they can nerf their racials then profit off the race transfers (hello undead/humans).<br />
<br />
Also fix the derp-snarl on worgen female, and the worgen female running wild animation looks like doggystyle porn or was this intentional? Either way not that impressed with this half-expansion so far, wish they put more effort into redefining the racials for all races and less effort into making the worgen female look like a retarded hyena head on a tauren females body.</div></div><hr />

I'm not an elitist to say the least, but I think wrath really spoiled the PvE types on what a PvP server really is. Seriously, if you want consented PvP... roll a PvE server.

On Tuesday morning our guild turned in 25 dailies per member that was on (like a dozen+ at the time) and we quickly hit Level 2 and earned the bonus of +5% XP for mobs/quests.<br />

I think it was a bug that you were able to get level 2 that quickly? I'm not sure. My guild is about halfway through level 1 right now and as far as I can tell we hit our daily maximum points yesterday. We had about 5 of us that powered through to level 83-84, and several more that popped on and did at least a level or two and when I hovered over &quot;guild experience&quot; it listed like &quot;Daily: 6024/6024&quot; (not a hundred percent sure of the number, but we maxed whatever it was). I think that's as far as you can go in a day. I assume... maybe... I wish they'd explain this a bit more :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isle of Quel'danas has nothing to do with the gank problem on most PVP realms, as already pointed out some realms it is virtually impossible for one faction to make any quest on the new zones duo the 10-1 ratio.<br />
<br />
Wrath destroyed faction balance on many servers because of the poor planed Wintergrasp PVE raid + faction transfers. So if &quot;pve players&quot; got spoiled into PVP realms, it was blizzard fault and they should, at least, take the responsibility for it.<br />
<br />
As a personal example, when BC hitted Gurubashi was a &quot;balanced&quot; server (with a little more ally that horde), today Gurubashi is a 5 horde 1 ally server, the worst is that horde numbers are still going up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think so, since apparently level 1 is meant to be the first thing earned. And we did hit the guild cap as well, based on our numbers, we'll re-hit level 2 probably shortly after server reset (3am EST) and then it'll take two days after to hit level 3.<br />
<br />
I'll check to see if wowarmory lets me see those numbers, if so I'll amend this post with updated info and/or reply again.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I don't get it at all. That experience is almost literally the only thing that a PvP server adds that a PvE server doesn't have. I'd kind of understand if there was some other sort of PvP experience added by PvP servers, but literally the only thing a PvP server adds is the ability to force someone not interested in PvP to participate in PvP (or more generously, being on a PvP server implies that there is never a moment when you are not interested in PvP when in the open world).<br />
<br />
While I can't think of a better name, I kinda wonder if the labels &quot;PvP&quot; and &quot;PvE&quot; themselves are just kind of old and out of date. They originated back in EQ days as I recall when a non-PvP server pretty much DID have no PvP outside of duels. WoW's PvE servers pretty much have 99% of the game's PvP, and all of the PvP that has a reward structure. I guess it is a little unfortunate that someone new to the game who loves PvP would think that means they should roll on a PvP server, since that very well may have absolutely nothing to do with what they consider PvP.</div></div><hr />

That, for me, is why PvP &gt; PvE anyday. Not because I like ganking, but because I like the thrill of ending up in a fight.

What you're experiencing is world PvP on a PvP realm. I realize that it's not for everyone, but it's not something that we plan to adjust. The harsh reality is that life on a PvP realm can be difficult, and if you aren't prepared for the rigors of playing on such a realm, then it's probably in your best interest to transfer to a normal realm, or, if you cannot afford that, then consider creating a new character on a normal realm.<br />
<br />
ppl are ppl realy complainin about that? I guess they don't know what the pvp flag in the server list actualy means -.- .. but awsome answer tho^^ <br />
I do so much enjoy leveling when so many players (and also of the oppossing faction) are around. You have to be careful if you want to kill someone and observe the surroundings how many players are around or if there maybe friends and guildmates who could come after you and such. this is open pvp, and this is missing when the big leveling phase is over and most players are hiding in instances and capitals again.<br />
<br />

I think you are one of those who didn't understand the pvp/pve label. Do you actualy realize that there are two fractions in this game? which are AT WAR? seriously, lore-wise horde and alliance hate each other. This is what you may experience on a pvp realm. You are meant to face the opposing fraction as enemy which means your first impuls should be he might kill you and you should kill him before he has the chance to. that was the original intent for pvp realms (besides I can't understand why there are pve realms anyways, cuz it leads the two fraction design ad absurdum). <br />
Even tho, you can see on pvp realms (on mine at least) that 90% of the players leave the others alone and concentrate on leveling while they level next to them. its not that bad.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Farming&quot; a low level player in STV is something that forced many of the ppl I know to move to a normal pve server.<br />
The rules against killing low level players are not existing in this game, and is making PVP servers a nightmare for leveling.</div></div><hr />
