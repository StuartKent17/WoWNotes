Pet Battle Spectating<br />
Yea, who needs arena spectating when you've got this <br />
The pet battle spectating is not really &quot;spectating&quot; as such. You do not get to watch players versus other players, you only get to see them when they are fighting a wild pets. Before this change all you would see when a player was battling wild pets was them just standing there idly, now the battle will be visible to outside parties and not just to the player battling the wild pets. This means that the &quot;pet battle spectating&quot; is not really a new system for watching pet battles that had to be developed, it was simply a change to make wild pet battles visible to outside observers. <br />
<br />
The same cannot be said for an arena spectating mode though. In order for us to create a system for arena spectating we would need to build a system from the ground up. While the ability to spectate arena matches is something that we would definitely love to implement into World of Warcraft, at this current point we have no plans for it.<br />
<br />
Its coded message to PvP community &quot;We dont give a fck about PvP or you, pokemon is all that matters&quot; <br />
That's as far from the truth as it gets, there is loads of new content and changes on its way for PvP in patch 5.3;<br />
Balance adjustments/changes New Arena New Battleground Conquest point catch-up system PvP gear changes PvP stat changes Battle fatigue changes And more...<br />
<br />
If we did not care for the state or well-being of PvP in World of Warcraft we would say so, however the reality is that we do care for PvP and we are constantly making changes and additions in order to improve it.<br />

That's pretty cool. Will be nice to have a new dungeon to do in that stretch of leveling, even if it's only for level 89.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Also why do people think it's just as easy to add pet battle spectating as it would be to add arena spectating?<br />
Arenas are an absolute massive chunk of the codebase and will probably require a lot of rework in order to accommodate something as sophisticated as spectating. The &quot;Pokemon&quot; system is a really simple chunk of code, which basically takes advantage of the phasing system. A system we all know can be toggled on and off easily. No extra UI elements needed. No significant changes to the system. No extra server load. Simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. The same goes for pretty much all tuned down dungeons. As long as they dont touch the heroic modes they can even lower the level more, so that we for example get the ICC dungeons at 79.</div></div><hr />

Someone already pointed out the official notes make the claims about level changes, and the 1% should really be 0% (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/331936735086915584) most likely. There is nothing wrong with the datamining.</div></div><hr />

Because unpeelable dances took such an absolute ridiculous amount of skill. Not to mention, oh let me dance and cheap or garrote the entire enemy team to peel for my healer. You should be happy it even made it into the live version of the game as is currently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except it would be a huge undertaking. Enormous. It'd probably be a project on the same scale as cross-realm zones, likely larger. <br />
<br />
The spectator mode you see on private servers is a really ghetto jerry-rigged setup that simply sticks spectators in the actual arena instance as invisible players. All movement/combat events the server is processing for the match have to be dispatched to each spectator in real-time, which would increase load on the server and possibly make matches lag for the combatants if there are a lot of people watching. Additionally, there is no time delay to prevent cheating, and it's impossible to implement one since the server &quot;forgets&quot; about events as soon as it has processed them. Blizzard will never implement a spectator mode in this way.<br />
<br />
Practically every other MMO/FPS/RTS/MOBA/whatever that has a spectator mode does it in the same way. Events from a match are recorded as a &quot;replay&quot; and then played back to spectators at a later time. This allows spectators to pause, resume, rewind, and fast forward through a match, because the server has a record of what happened during the match. There can also be a time delay to prevent cheating. Additionally, the replay is almost certainly being hosted and processed by a separate server dedicated to nothing but spectator mode, so even if there are 100 people watching and the server is lagging, the original arena match was still only processing events for the six combatants (plus of course whatever other arenas were running at the time on that server).<br />
<br />
This system is much more flexible and less open to abuse/lag, but it is way more work. Every single action has to be recorded to make sure an accurate replay can be played back later, anything that is random (damage values, crits, procs, dodges, fear pathing, etc.) needs to play out the same way. For something like an RTS this isn't so bad because of the peer-to-peer lockstep model they typically use, and it is fairly easy to generate a replay that plays out exactly the same every time simply by recording player input and keeping RNG synchronized (with the downside that you usually . For an MMO this is a much bigger challenge, and simply recording player input may not be enough to create a deterministic replay due to latency or other influences (as described above, there's a lot more randomness to account for in an MMORPG). It's not impossible for an MMO (GW1 and 2 do it), but they generally have to be made with it in mind from the start. Shoehorning this into 8 year server software will be a challenge.<br />
<br />
I would freaking love a spectator mode, but I also realize that it IS a ton of work. And on top of that, it's something many, many players will never even touch. And on top of that, many of those who do won't think of it as much more than a neat toy. I just don't see it happening anytime even remotely soon, if it ever even happens at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The buff abilities already refresh before they expire. Besides MM and Surv hunters dont have a problem with raid buffs.<br />

My MM/Surv hunter is tired of not being buffed because BM is op too. I would rather they were buffed to bring them up to BM intead of nerfing BM to make it more in line with the rest of the specs. Although they are reducing the CD on rabid so thats a buff.</div></div><hr />
