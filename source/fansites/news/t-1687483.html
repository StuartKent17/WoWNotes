I start this post saying that I think that flying mount removal was a good thing. Yeah it slows down travel times, but its made the game feel more open and alive in my opinion. That doesn't mean that flying mounts don't have a place in the game. I just think that they need a redesign. <br />
A number of flight-specific toys and items were implemented to let you glide around the game world. There are also some zone-specific items, as well as items from past expansions that can help achieve the same thing as well--as well as potentially combined to some extreme results. I may also be forgetting a few?<br />
<br />
Why do you guys say you're removing flying to help untrivialize combat and then put in items to help trivialize it<br />
These don't allow you to lift up and set down wherever you like. They are generally also managed with cooldowns or charges. They do allow you to travel quickly across the game world, but they're generally not as precise or consistent as to change the moment to moment gameplay like full flight does.<br />
<br />
I've always wished that when you aim your mount down it accelerated though. Like a dive bomb of sorts. Screen shaking, all that jazz.<br />
Me too, actually! Or that the flaps/gliding animations would match my in-game trajectory. I think it's probably a fair amount of art and engineering work to do, though, and to be frank flight just isn't a system we've ever really looked at building out. Actually... that's sort of not true, early on in BC we tried some things to try to make flight a part of the gameplay, and even put a lot of effort into new flight mechanics in Wrath (which then got scrapped), but it really just doesn't work for what this game is and how the engine and content are created. WoW just isn't a flight sim, and creating those kinds of mechanics is very difficult, and even potentially radically different than the core gameplay that defines it.

Warlords of Draenor Raid Preview: Blackrock Foundry<br />
Blackrock Foundry was the ancestral home of the Blackrock orcs, wherein master smiths smelted and worked the impossibly hard ore that is the clan’s namesake. Now, massive giants captured and broken by the Thunderlord heat the great forges, flamebenders of the Burning Blade imbue the ore with an inner fire, and engineers shape the slag according to otherworldly schematics. Warlord Blackhand’s foundry is the center of the Iron Horde’s military might, churning out the weaponry that will be used to raze Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Just when you thought you’d become comfortable (as comfortable as one can get in a gladiator pit) with Highmaul, we thought it was time to shake things up and show you what’s waiting in our next Raid—Blackrock Foundry—and introduce you to Rukhmar, the latest world Raid boss. <br />
<br />
We asked senior 3D artist Andy Matthews to provide some insight into the dungeon’s visual development:<br />
<br />
The Foundry’s spark of inspiration was the creation of the Slagworks’ “furnace room;” it created iconic silhouettes that we carried throughout the rest of the Raid, which has a very strong industrial look and feel.<br />
<br />
The Dread Grotto was my favorite shot to establish in the Raid. In its early development, we wanted to show the Iron Horde’s shipping area from multiple angles, foreshadowing later content. The Workshop shows the daily grind of factory life for the Ironworkers. Most workers dread the “flame-jet Fridays.” <br />
<br />
Some say the Iron Horde motto is, “When in doubt, add a spike!”<br />

<br />
You’ll need a minimum item level of 635 to tackle Blackrock Foundry via Raid Finder. The Foundry’s rewards range from item level 650 (Raid Finder) to 695 (Mythic).<br />
<br />
Let’s take a look at the bosses that await you within Blackrock Foundry. . . .<br />
<br />
<br />
Slagworks<br />
Gruul- Garrosh knew that the surest path to breaking the gronn lay in subjugating their great father, Gruul. Known in another time as the Dragonkiller, here Gruul has been reduced to the role of menial laborer. In a cruel mockery of the Shattered Hand’s warrior tradition, his hand has been replaced with a hook to enable him to more easily haul pallets of fuel to the furnace.<br />

<br />
Oregorger- The storehouses of the Blackrock Foundry, laden with heaps and pallets of unprocessed Blackrock ore, represent a grand banquet feast for the ravenous rock-eating goren who have burrowed into the chamber. Oregorger is by far the largest of the invaders, gluttony swelling his frame far beyond the size of any goren previously seen in Draenor.<br />
<br />

<br />
The Blast Furnace- The Blackrock clan’s unique ability to smelt the black ore, a substance so dense that ordinary flame does not even soften it, has always been their most closely-guarded secret. Deep within the Foundry, their furnace contains a primal force as old as Draenor itself, raging within the confines of its prison as it emanates a preternatural heat.<br />

<br />
The Black Forge<br />
Hans’gar and Franzok- Hans’gar and Franzok are twin brothers raised and trained as masterful brawlers of their clan. Both carved paths of glory as warriors, but destiny had other plans. The brothers, each unwilling to slay the other in the rite of mak’gora, were banished from their clan and left for dead. They survived as outcasts in the savage wilds of Draenor and when the Iron Horde called, these powerful warriors found a new home in the massive war machine.<br />

<br />
Flamebender Ka’graz- Under the banner of the Iron Horde, Blackhand has enlisted Flamebender Ka’graz of the Burning Blade to imbue the Blackrock-forged armaments with the essence of flame. Along with her assistant Aknor Steelbringer, Ka’graz toils before an ever burning forge in support of the Iron Horde’s conquest of Draenor.<br />

<br />
Kromog- The magnaron are mysterious in their ways, ancient and inscrutable. Miners excavating an expansion to the Foundry, in support of the Iron Horde’s massive production needs, were horrified to unearth a chamber containing a living magnaron. To their astonishment, Kromog began to assist in their endeavors, and now uses his massive stone fists to hammer out the gigantic plates needed for the Iron Horde’s dreadnaughts and siege machinery.<br />

<br />
<br />
Iron Assembly<br />
Beastlord Darmac- As a young orc, Darmac quickly rose through the ranks of the Thunderlord as a gifted trainer of beasts. Where others only saw animal instincts, he recognized intellect and drew forth untapped potential from brain and muscle and bone. When the Iron Horde demanded his service, Darmac saw no greater honor than to outfit and train the most savage beasts Draenor has to offer.<br />

Operator Thogar- Known more for his cruelty and cleverness than for brute strength, Thogar oversees the operation of the Grimrail. From the Foundry’s depot, he coordinates the ongoing ground battle against the draenei in Talador, with entire battalions of troops and artillery at his beck and call.<br />

<br />
The Iron Maidens- With little opportunity to exercise her tactical brilliance under the ancient social structure of the orc clans, Gar’an was thrilled to be one of the first warriors to volunteer for naval duty under the Iron Horde. Instantly successful in battle, she was named Admiral of the iron Horde fleet and selected Marak and Sorka as her lieutenants. Together, they are called the Iron Maidens, and have crushed any who have dared face them.<br />

<br />
The Crucible<br />
Blackhand- A ruthless tyrant and fierce warrior, Blackhand is Warlord of the Blackrock clan, second only to Grommash in stature within the Iron Horde. Bathed in sweltering heat that few other mortals could withstand, Blackhand oversees the operations of his Foundry from atop its Crucible, wielding his smoldering slag hammer to forge weapons of peerless quality.<br />

Maybe in the early days of the expansion, anyway be sure to recruit some scavengers and always max out your trade post work orders.</div></div><hr />

Yes the problem is you. My war mill has been working non stop since launch and I don't have a TP/LM and I am constantly hitting 10k while spamming missions. <br />

Lumbermill + worker is plenty with your free GR to hold War Mill going. Mill and Salvage Yard and you get alot of upgrades. Think I have 6-7 on 655 ilvl and the rest in 630+.</div></div><hr />

Foundry goes live Feb 3rd. I'm not expecting 6.1 before the last Tues of Feb at the very earliest as it's very much been a work in progress. Probably early-mid March. Too bad we don't get our Foundry cache mission until 6.1, wish they could hotfix it in!</div></div><hr />

I do have to say, really? 100 for 6 weeks and only 1 follower above 645? ... You must be missing something, my DK has been 100 for about 10 weeks granted... but I have 22 Followers maxed out at 655...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. <br />
<br />
Between resources from the trading post and from salvage, I'm never without resources these days.<br />
<br />
It is ridiculously easy to accumulate resources in this expansion -- if you have the right buildings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do you guys say you're removing flying to help untrivialize combat and then put in items to help trivialize it<br />
These don't allow you to lift up and set down wherever you like. They are generally also managed with cooldowns or charges. They do allow you to travel quickly across the game world, but they're generally not as precise or consistent as to change the moment to moment gameplay like full flight does.<br />
<br />
It all seems to come down to minutes (or &quot;moments&quot; here). <br />
<br />
For instance, Aviana's Feather very much does allow you to &quot;lift up and set down wherever you like.&quot; In fact, it is something of a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card, with regards to bypassing normal game mechanics. No less than 10 times have I used it to get to quest mobs faster, to escape from PvP situations, and just to generally travel at a more rapid speed than a fp would provide. The 10-minute cooldown also is manageable. 10 minutes is not that long to wait when you're multitasking -- taking care of additional tasks or quests in a given area. So really it all just comes down to the &quot;moments.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is it really that important that I spend a few extra moments waiting for the feather to come off cd, than if I could just mount up and do it via flyer? <br />
<br />
The only way I can imagine those extra moments having any sort of relevance is if there just isn't that much content to wade through this expansion -- a harsh notion that becomes a little more believable by the day. I can't speak for anyone else, but personally, I've already done just about everything you can on one character (or at least of the content I desire). The new Oqueue-like group finder makes rep grinding and mat farming easier than ever before. I'm continually pushing the max resource cap of 10k, and I'm struggling to find things to buy with them. Getting a surplus of Apexis crystals is easy as sin. Gold is much easier to come by than in any other expansion I can recall. Pretty much the only thing left is treasure hunting (I'm steadily burning through those like a weed sack). <br />
<br />
At some point, there may be nothing left but to add flight. <br />
<br />
I gotta be honest: I didn't expect to be turning to my alts less than 3 months after the xpac dropped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It makes me sick doing Apexis grind once a day let alone twice (and thefore I don't)<br />
<br />
And you get access to 800 apexis which are used to just make 655 gear....<br />

You do realize the combined value of what they offer is almost $60.00 in that pack right (and that is using the non-gold Cyber Wolf pricing for it, cause the Gold one is exclusive to this pack and one other $40 pack). And that is characters, skins, etc. that you keep into live too. Sure, you can buy the heroes with gold in-game, but the skins are $$$ only, same with the mount and gold. Removing the heroes, and it is still almost $40.00 worth of stuff. Beta access is a bonus at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As the title states, you could try crying more, maybe the they will allow flying. <br />
<br />
You say you're turning to your alts? So does that mean you have only maxed 1 toon an expansion? Because I've never met anyone besides a new player that doesn't have multiple alts at max level. So once again, cry more.<br />
<br />
If Blizz would hold off longer on 6.1 people would cry it's taking too long. If they pumped out patches with new content every 3 months you would say it's too fast.<br />
<br />
Look at how many flying mounts Blizz added this expansion. Then ask yourself how many of them are flying mounts. You'll see the answer. No flying mounts added, no flying. Problem solved.</div></div><hr />

You're basically exchanging a useless item for another useless item. Might be a bit useful for alts though.<br />
<br />
All these follower armor and weapon items are... not well balanced. In the first month you struggle to get enough. After that you start to vendor kits below 645 because there is like 0% chance they will ever be useful for anything. I mean you won't get 20 more followers with each patch, will you? Weap/arm enhancements can be useful when the follower ilvl limit gets bumped but you need just a small amount of these. After that they are useless again.</div></div><hr />

LoL has a stupid amount of income from hero unlocks, skins, and other visual customizations. Same model here. But good to know you read up on it to bash things appropriately.<br />

Blizzard Store will also sell like 3 different skins per hero, various different mounts and skill unlocks for real moneyzzz only.</div></div><hr />

Of course it's a F2P model... but it's not F2P if you are CHARGING for beta access. Now if they said &quot;Open Beta with option to purchase a Founder's pack for $40&quot; then it wouldn't be quite as pathetic. But they are CHARGING players to play.. in the guise of giving them &quot;items&quot;<br />

Yep sure balancing a MOBA is exactly the same as balancing a MMO, MMOs have gear progression, MMOs have PvE and PvP to try and balance at the same time, yep it is exactly the same....<br />
<br />
Blizzard actually have a really good reputation of balancing if you look at Starcraft, it is one of the most balanced RTS in existiance, and guess what Starcraft does not have gear progression and stats that interact with each other...<br />

There are a ton of free beta people. I´ve been playing HoTS for almost 8 months already.<br />
<br />
I would also bet a large number of people who were in the beta already are going to buy this pack. It is a huge discount for stuff most people know they are going to buy after launch anyway.<br />
<br />
I generally hate companies that sell alpha or pre-release access for unfinished games. But I think Blizzard is very very conservative with how they classify their new games. HoTS was a lot of fun, and very bug-free even 8 months ago. Probably the only thing you will have to deal with in ´beta´ is some big nerfs/buffs, but that is going to be true even in a live game. Hearthstone was the same way.. the beta was actually a finished and polished game. I think HoTS and HS are very different than what other companies call betas.</div></div><hr />

I got into the Alpha before Christmas and Blizzard is still rolling out invites. So no, they are not charging for Beta access. However, if you are that deperate to get into the game immediately, then you get some in-game goods as well as Beta access. You don't have to pay a dime to play this game.<br />

Depends completely on what you are looking at. I payed for an Arthas skin for about 5 euros (including current discount), which is about 1/8th of the price of the Nexus Bundle with a bunch of Heroes, skins, and mounts. As for this bundle, it is not as big as the Nexus Bundle, but compared to the prices of the skins and Heroes you get from the Founder's Pack with what they cost individually, it is a pretty decent discount.</div></div><hr />

I could get one new follower each week. Usually i get 0 to 1 items, that can bring a followers weapon/armor level to 645, per week.

I understand the whole concept of not wanting to make things toys that have a &quot;gameplay function,&quot; but the Anatomical Dummy is so absolutely limited that any &quot;gameplay function&quot; it has is trivial. It only works in Pandaria, and only outside instances. Even DURING MoP I never had a use for it. Now it is completely useless. Just make it a toy.<br />
<br />
Old raids don't need more incentive. You can make so much money by vendoring all the drops you get. Considering the time it takes (which is not long), it is totally a viable way of making money. That's plenty of incentive. That being said, still am excited for more raid-themed pets and hope to see more in the future.</div></div><hr />

Indeed.

I was gone for the entire expansion and only came back 6 weeks prior to WoD.<br />
<br />
What a JOKE. WoD isn't WoW.. it's a pre-stage free to play wannabe,,, with a Garrison game I guarantee you will be spun off into it's own free to play game. Count on it. ANd of course I cancelled my sub that ended end of Dec.<br />

<br />
<br />
Of course not, they keep replying to anti-flying posts. They want to keep removing things that allows the player to move through content at their pace instead of Blizzards. First it was the mass summons now it's flying. What's next they are going to remove land mounts because it's not 'immersive enough'? Mind you, I'm being sarcastic but the point is they have no reason to do it other than to slow you down and gate your experience. Flying was never a mistake, it's one of the biggest selling point of this MMO when compared to other MMO's like it. Ever since MoP they have been heavily gating how the players experience the zones. If it's not dailies or rep grinds, it's gating via exploration. <br />
<br />
I still think they will add flying when they release Tannan Jungle, especially since by then the majority of the player base will be wanting it back. People get bored quick in this game.</div></div><hr />

The apexis daily fells extremley grindy to me.<br />

If I compare it to the Garrsion Weekly which I actually really like.<br />

They are actually the same except that the Garrison Weekly has some context instead of just mindless grinding!<br />

Not sure that makes any sense, all I know is I avoid the Apexis daily as much as I can even though I can do it in 10 mins in a group finder group and I do the Garrison Weekly way more often even though I do this solo.<br />

Are the really adding a 4th tier and its just going to be 670, or can you buy 670 without the other 3 bits?<br />

<br />
When D3 launched with their money grubbing RMAH and tuning to funnel people there... they lost most of my loyalty. D3:ROS regained a very small amount of respect by reverting almost ALL of the bullshit they tried to get by with in D3. I stopped playing WoW at that time too... just before PandaLand launched. I was gone for the entire expansion and only came back 6 weeks prior to WoD.<br />
<br />
What a JOKE. WoD isn't WoW.. it's a pre-stage free to play wannabe,,, with a Garrison game I guarantee you will be spun off into it's own free to play game. Count on it. ANd of course I cancelled my sub that ended end of Dec.<br />
<br />
As far as Heroes of the Shitstorm? They can have that PoS.. never played their Facebook cardgame either... Hurlstone. Blizzard no longer develops great games.. they just pander to the ADHD riddled kiddies of today.<br />
<br />
Say what you want, but how can you say hearthstone is a bad game? Keep whining and being bitter and see where it gets you. If you hate Blizzard so much, stop posting in blizzard threads.</div></div><hr />

Its all in your head. On paper Apexis dailys should feel better because you can choose to complete them doing what you like instead of being forced into direct paths with dailys. Also, how long does that context from a daily mean anything? 2 or 3 times maybe, but then it becomes just as grindy as Apexis dailys.<br />

I have no doubt it is more efficent.<br />
<br />
I do 100% doubt I enjoy it more.<br />
<br />
For example in mists I really enjoyed the Shado Pan dailies did those a lot throughout the entire expansion.<br />

I really liked Isle of Thunder as well was still doing that every so often till the end of Mists.<br />

I just don't have any motivation to farm them anymore. I've obtained about 10 mounts since WoD released and the complete lack of enthusiasm for it with each one was very telling. I'm glad some of you are happy about it. For me it's ruined one of my favorite past times. Sure I've got alts, but I learned in MoP just how useless they were if I didn't do the legendary quest on them. So for me, I'm just not playing as much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course it's a F2P model... but it's not F2P if you are CHARGING for beta access. Now if they said &quot;Open Beta with option to purchase a Founder's pack for $40&quot; then it wouldn't be quite as pathetic. But they are CHARGING players to play.. in the guise of giving them &quot;items&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizz can't balance WoW PvP... a game they have been developing (cough) for 10 years.... and they are going to produce a halfway decent LoL clone? Me thinks not.<br />
<br />
It tastes sweet that Blizz is now the company trying to clone the king of it's genre and will fail miserably.<br />
<br />
It's an OPTION to get into Beta. I got into it 100% free. Not a single dime spent. Got my alpha invite way back when people were still waiting on WoD Beta's. And now that it is in Beta they are still doing invite waves. The Founder's pack is simply a way to avoid the RNG of the invites.<br />
<br />
The pack is also one of the ordinary packs available on the store (and has been available for some time), they just decided to tack Beta Access onto it. Buy it or don't, up to you. But I find it funny that people call HotS a clone when in reality all MOBAS are a clone of DOTA.....which originated in WARCRAFT 3. Blizzard was, in an indirect way, responsible for the creation of the genre.<br />
<br />
MMO PVP can never be perfectly balanced. Anyone with any common sense will know this. The best they can do is get it CLOSE to balanced. Show me an MMO with perfect pvp balance, and I will show you a liar.<br />
<br />
Like Hearthstone before it....expect HotS to quickly climb the list to the top of the genre.</div></div><hr />

I was like that for a few weeks, until I stopped having to upgrade buildings and was able to start to stockpile resources. Now I am trying to find ways to spend them down because I am constantly close to cap. I have the bunker, trading post, gladiators sanctum, salvage yard, engineering hut, and storehouse so I dont even have some of the big garrison resource buildings. Just make sure to max your trading post and get some followers with scavanger even if you have to dump a building for a little while to get them from the inn. I did that early in the expansion and the three or four of them are a huge help especially when I can stack them on one mission.</div></div><hr />

You do realise how common this is nowadays with things like deluxe or CE, and that there is nothing &quot;greedy&quot; about charging for beta? I mean their &quot;greedy&quot; customers don't have to pay for it but they want to try the game sooner than later. How is this any different and why is Blizzard the bad guy for charging for it?

How could those 2 EVER relate. -_-<br />
<br />
They're not just selling beta access. They are giving beta access to those who decide they want to buy the pack. The things included in the pack are worth over 60€, while the pack costs 35€.<br />
<br />
And most people who join betas don't really &quot;test&quot;, they just play. Sure playing offers them metrics and the likes, but it's really not comparable to payed playtesting. You're not working for them by playing their game.</div></div><hr />

I can't speak for anyone else, but personally, I've already done just about everything you can on one character (or at least of the content I desire). The new Oqueue-like group finder makes rep grinding and mat farming easier than ever before. I'm continually pushing the max resource cap of 10k, and I'm struggling to find things to buy with them. Getting a surplus of Apexis crystals is easy as sin. Gold is much easier to come by than in any other expansion I can recall. Pretty much the only thing left is treasure hunting (I'm steadily burning through those like a weed sack). <br />
<br />
At some point, there may be nothing left but to add flight. <br />

I gotta be honest: I didn't expect to be turning to my alts less than 3 months after the xpac dropped.<br />

<br />
You say you're turning to your alts? So does that mean you have only maxed 1 toon an expansion? Because I've never met anyone besides a new player that doesn't have multiple alts at max level. So once again, cry more.<br />
<br />
If Blizz would hold off longer on 6.1 people would cry it's taking too long. If they pumped out patches with new content every 3 months you would say it's too fast.<br />
<br />
Look at how many flying mounts Blizz added this expansion. Then ask yourself how many of them are flying mounts. You'll see the answer. No flying mounts added, no flying. Problem solved.<br />
<br />
What would be the point? If tears solved problems, I would cry buckets. They do not. <br />
<br />
What I wrote is an observation. If it hits a little too close for comfort, hell, it happens. <br />
<br />
P.S. - The Collector's Edition mount is a flyer. In fact, the advertising on the box specifies that a player can &quot;soar through the skies&quot; on the thing. <br />
<br />
Also, the new mount store Silithid-style bug mount is a flyer. Clearly they have not entirely forsaken it this expansion.<br />

What I think people are forgetting about is &quot;YMMV&quot; -- your mileage may vary. And before anyone objects to what I'm putting forth, here are my credentials:<br />
<br />
Have had both a level 3 Salvage Yard and War Mill since November.<br />
Been running work orders at full tilt <br />
Filling out as many missions as possible (I earned On a Metric Ton of Missions (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9140-on-a-metric-ton-of-missions) on Jan. 7th)<br />
<br />
<br />
Having said that, I have done all that and it wasn't until this week that I got 3 followers to 655. Remember that &quot;YMMV&quot; I mentioned earlier? That's because of RNG. I've seen others starving for weapon tokens while I was having problems with getting armor tokens (I'm back to needing both). Some just keep getting the item level 615 tokens that are worthless to them, others not having to deal so much with that. Perhaps a person is simply having streak of poor luck with the yard while the Dwarven Bunker/War Mill is giving them the middle finger.<br />
<br />
And lastly, there was the perverse incentive for awhile for a player to not level a follower to increase the payout from the yard. I was one of those who didn't take advantage of that because I was focused on getting as many of my followers to epic 100s ASAP. It was good that Blizzard changed how the system worked in that area soon after, but I feel it still needs improving.<br />

Yeah, I haven't even bought WoD yet, I will wait until flying is in the game again.<br />
<br />
But tbh I'm hearing mostly negative things about this expansion (threads in the official WoW forums have shifted from &quot;WoD is one of the worst... &quot; to &quot;... is the worst expansion ever&quot;), and most of my friends (with some of them I've played since TBC) have stopped playing alltogether. Some at the content hole at the end MoP, some after giving WoD a try.<br />
Apparently only 1 person of our old raid still plays the game, so yeah... not much reason to try WoD anyways for me, even if they would allow flying again right now.</div></div><hr />

Did you even read the whole thing? You can get beta access in classical way, but with demand that HotS gets (despite being kinda boring and feeling slow paced, but maybe I'm just bored with MOBA genre) it's not a surprise that you can buy beta access. You are not forced to do it, you can get beta in normal way, so it's a bonus. That's point of view of developer/company/neutral.<br />

From player's PoV I agree that it's abusive, but hey, let's be honest. Players asked for that, they throw money at companies and act like gods thinking they can demand everything &quot;'cos they paid monies!&quot;, while in the end they are dependent on company's work like kids on mother's milk :) If gamers didn't pay for games like CoD, BF, FIFA, which are the same each year/part with some minor graphical tweaks, this wouldn't have happened. You showed companies you are willing to throw money away. Company's job is to earn as much money as possible, so you can't blame Blizzard. And while I don't like it, it's sad truth - players, being stupid as hell and easily manipulated by stories of their higher IQ and value, got themselves into that mess. Want this to end? Stop paying for every crap company releases. And no, hate posts and whining on fan pages/forums won't help, they don't care as long as you pay, and you pay. Welcome to 21st century, where customer is no longer the boss, because boss got lazy and stupid.<br />
<br />
I simply wonder whether the money I pay will be refunded like in case of in-game items, or if it's lost. 40€ is a lot in Loland :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
But tbh I'm hearing mostly negative things about this expansion (threads in the official WoW forums have shifted from &quot;WoD is one of the worst... &quot; to &quot;... is the worst expansion ever&quot;), and most of my friends (with some of them I've played since TBC) have stopped playing alltogether. Some at the content hole at the end MoP, some after giving WoD a try.<br />
Apparently only 1 person of our old raid still plays the game, so yeah... not much reason to try WoD anyways for me, even if they would allow flying again right now.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but how long have you been playing this game? These threads have been there for EVERY SINGLE expansion except for maybe BC because it didn't have anything to be compared with back in the day. Every time an expension is released there are heaps of threads on how bad it is. <br />
<br />
It's funny how people now talk about how great WotLK was, when I clearly remember back then there where so so so so many threads on how it's way too easy and this and that... <br />
<br />
I for one like WoD and have been having fun. Some threads on the forums don't really represent anything (just like my comment on here doesn't mean that everyone else loves it).</div></div><hr />

Funny that you ask, because this morning I was asking this myself and checked archive.org snapshots of the official wow forums after the Cata and MoP releases. 2 months after the Cata start there were a couple of &quot;I don't like this xpac&quot; posts to be seen without giving a clear reason why, and &quot;it's too hard, don't want to spend 1.5 hours in a heroic&quot; usually. 2 months after MoP &quot;what does Blizzard do about all the ghost realms?&quot; was the big thing people complained about.<br />
Threads like &quot;WoD is one of the worst xpacs ever&quot; (source (http://eu.battle.net/wow/de/forum/topic/12844845320)) with 250 pages (now closed and the next one is called (...the worst...) and &quot;no flying with patch 6.1&quot; with 137 pages are pretty unique to this expansion though, and most of the other stuff on the front page also reads like &quot;give content&quot; &quot;It's not that bad&quot; &quot;I'm unsubbing&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't wanna argue what &quot;the people&quot; think* though based on this, but my personal experience is this: all of my friends except one stopped playing... guys I've raided from TBC - MoP with. I might give WoD a try if they allow flying again, but after all I've heard the arguments brought up by the critical voices seem solid to me. People seem to agree that leveling was cool, but apparently that's it basically.<br />
<br />
<br />
*That probably does only Blizzard know, and they don't have an interest in publishing hard numbers. They will do their usual thing: claim that everything is fine and people like it (if not they will make sure that people do something by putting more and more rewards into it). And 1 year before the next xpac they will say &quot;guys, we listen to your criticism, but it's too late now. But wait for the next expansion, it will be 175% better! Wait for the 7.0 beta in a couple of months!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;lets make cheaper content with lesser manpower and effort and test if they play it already&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;hey, the accounts have just the normal sink. they accept that bullshit :)&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;k. good. lets try to make it one step more lesser manpower/effort and lets try again&quot;<br />
<br />
that pattern repeats in wow since 4-5 years. and they try and do it in every single game they have since then. as i said, i play (also yet) wow since 10 years. but not because it is sooo great and full of high quality content. only because the other mmos are sadly more worse than wow. so i pay them their money for much lesser than in the past. but i must be blind if not realize what i do.<br />
<br />
so, i must ask the question to some of you: are you really THAT blind ???</div></div><hr />
