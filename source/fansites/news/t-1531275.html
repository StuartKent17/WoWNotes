Warlords of Draenor - Stormwind Repairs<br />
It looks like progress on the Stormwind repairs may be made during Warlords of Draenor!<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Alpha - Reagent Bank<br />
Warlords of Draenor will add another tab to your regular bank with 98 slots to store profession reagents. Keep in mind that profession reagents will now form much larger stacks, with many stacking to 200.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Alpha - Void Storage Size Increase<br />
Warlords of Draenor also increases the size of Void Storage, adding a second tab with the same number of slots as the first.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Alpha - Garrison Blueprint Prices<br />
If you choose to avoid questing or other activities that reward blueprints (http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=blueprint&amp;filter-quality=8) for your garrison while leveling, you can still purchase blueprints for the buildings at level 100. <br />
<br />
Currently every building's blueprint costs 5,000 gold, with the exception of the stables, which cost 1,000 gold. Keep in mind that this is early alpha, so prices can and will likely change before release.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Alpha - New Quests<br />
Several new quests were added in the latest build, many of them being tracking quests or quests for rare spawns and treasure found in the world. <br />
<br />
We have listed the others below, but you can find the full list of new quests on the WoWDB Beta site (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests?filter-build=18322) and our original Warlords quest preview here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3960-Warlords-of-Draenor-Quest-Preview-May-2-Hotfixes-Blue-Tweets-Classic-Games-Art).<br />

Warlords of Draenor Alpha - Stat Squish Status<br />
Those in our Alpha will immediately notice that the stats on your gear, as well as your base health, have been scaled down as part of our broad &quot;stat squish&quot; that we have previously discussed.<br />
<br />
All content in Draenor is currently suited to these new values, and Siege of Orgrimmar has actually been converted to use the new raid structure (since I know that the absolute first thing everyone will want to do upon getting access to our Alpha is to go run Siege). But if you find yourself in any other locations in the old world, beware that while creature health and melee damage has been &quot;squished,&quot; the damage values of their abilities/spells has not yet been. So a yaungol's Fireball that used to hit you for 50,000 still hits you for 50,000. (But you of course have far less health now.)<br />
<br />
We're making sure that we're completely happy with the state of numbers before taking the final step of locking in those values for all old content, since it's a lot of data to touch. So in the meantime, if you decide to do something like visit Timeless Isle, or Throne of Thunder, or other pre-Warlords content, it will not go well for you. But please don't be alarmed or concerned that you'll be unable to do older content as a result of the squish. The current state of affairs is temporary, and we'll let you know once Azeroth has been fully updated to reflect the new stat values.<br />
<br />
<br />
Azeroth Choppers Vote<br />
I saw enough people--and it's been my task to develop and watch much of the social support surrounding Choppers--saying they play Alliance but would be voting for the Horde bike. It wasn't a negligible amount, either. Probably a good indicator that this wasn't just a &quot;vote for your faction&quot; situation for everyone, and enough people voted for the bike they just liked the looks of better to make a difference.<br />
<br />
I think it would have been cool to have people pick which faction they play for, as well as which bike they like better, so we could see what that data breakdown is, but that just wasn't the purpose or scope of the project.<br />
<br />
I have never, ever seen a more one-sided poll in my life. This is obviously fabricated.<br />
If it were fabricated it would have been much closer, as there could have been some drama built up over a close proximity of voting percentages. Having such a one-sided result left us with a less exciting way to present a result. So, no, it being so one-sided was decidedly less than ideal. But hey, that's the risk you run with a popular vote.<br />
<br />
The goal was to have the community vote for which bike should be in-game, and that's what happened.<br />

Warlords of Draenor Professions and Character Boosts<br />
With the 90 boosts we want to ensure getting professions to a point where they're usable by your character supports where you want to be in the game, and doesn't require things like going back to low level zones to farm materials for crafting. Of course if your character is above level 60 when you boost you get the bonus of fully leveled primary professions. If you aren't 60 when you boost, we want to ensure professions are fairly painless to get up to a level where they're useful for your newly boosted 90 (or even if you just never bothered leveling them before). In Warlords, Herbalism and Mining will be changing to a fishing-like structure, where skill ups can be obtained from any nodes, and only the result of what you get is based on skill level. Materials to level up crafting can be obtained wholly within the newest content (Warlords) with catch up recipes like Cooking saw in Mists, and potentially additional paths to allow players to avoid having to go back to old content, if they wish.<br />
<br />
From the Warlords of Draenor Alpha patch notes:<br />
<br />
<br />
Herbalists can now harvest herbs throughout the game world without hard skill requirements. The yield an Herbalist will be able to harvest from each node is now determined by skill level.<br />
Miners can now harvest mineral nodes in outdoor areas of the game world without hard skill requirements. The yield a Miner will be able to harvest from each node is now determined by skill level.<br />
[/i]<br />
<br />
Why is skinning never included in these skill-up bonuses? Skinning is the only one where I seem to always find myself going back to lower level areas committing genocide and taking mobs away from lowbies to level it because I need the skill.<br />
<br />
Was it an abuse issue or something? You'd think it would be more abusive to have to clear vastly lower level areas for skins, right? Leatherworking could use some serious love too...<br />
The way skinning loot tables work makes it a very different situation than the other gathering professions, and so it's a technical limitation that keeps us from being able to easily base the result off of skill level. I know it is a desire to resolve that limitation, but it of course requires engineering work, and I'm not sure when that's expected to be completed. It could be something fairly complex, I'm not sure. I'll follow up.

Experience in Groups While Leveling<br />
half xp, but you do slaughter mobs much quicker in a group[/i]<br />
Right, the intent is of course to compensate for the fact that you'll actually kill mobs more than X times quicker (where X is the number of people in the party) due to not only increased damage, but increase in breadth of abilities being available from multiple characters. You're able to be more efficient, which means quests are completed faster, and quest XP is generally where the majority of your experience is coming from. You're going to be leveling faster than you would alone as long as your efficiency keeps pace with each additional party member added.

Any chance we ever see a ranged attacking hunter pet? I feel hydras would be the best for it. Pathing issues makes more appealing.<br />
Would love to do these, need to talk to class guys about balance. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/471889240360370176))<br />

Update: Rylaks now tameable (exotic). Hook wasps have joined the wasp family. Still no unicorns. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/471889901042933760))<br />
Can we get a hint as to what a Rylak is? Is it a new creature we've never seen from datamining, or an older creature we had?<br />
Iron Skyreaver is a Rylak. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/472052575538532353))<br />

PvP<br />
is PVP gear going to exactly match pve? or different model sets? different colours?<br />
Same models. Mostly likely different colors. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/471474992123633665))<br />
<br />
Hi unsure of this has been asked/answered, but will PvP gear change with spec as PvE gear will in WoD? This would be amazing.<br />
yes it will! (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/471690255670583297))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
I'm liking the idea of having the garrison outposts in zones - kind of a home away from home away from home!<br />
That's the idea! You will be able to do some basic garrison functions from the outposts too, like missions! (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/471705073152974848))<br />
How big will the Outposts be?<br />
They are good sized quest hubs.<br />
Will some of your followers be found at the outposts?<br />
We are contemplating that for sure.<br />
Will we have to micromanage the remaining outposts that we establish as well, or will they be of a more passive nature?<br />
The outposts are passive. You can choose to interact with missions there as a bonus while you are in that zone. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/471749832642945024))<br />
<br />
so if armory is an artillery strike what does a mage tower grant?<br />
The current design on the Mage Tower is that you summon a Guardian Orb help you in combat. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/471750703590178817))<br />
<br />
for the workshop in gorgrond can i pick my champion? Like a champion of the alliance?<br />
It actually summons a random champion from a pool each time. All have unique effects. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/471750929302446080))<br />
<br />
What does the arena do for you?<br />
New missions and bonuses and specs to improve the gorgrond ability and follower upgrades. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/471804273094037504))<br />
<br />
Let's say I build a sparring arena in Gorgrond and a Lumber mill in my SMV garrison. Will I get both perks in Gorgrond or only one?<br />
You would not be able to do that since your choice in Gorgrond rewards the corresponding building plan for your garrison.<br />
I mean at max level and I build a lumber mill in my garrison, but a sparring arena in Gorgrond.<br />
You will get the bonus you chose in that zone. In this case, you would have access to the Sparring Arena bonus in Gorgrond. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/471755968335052800))<br />
<br />
Wasn't it said that you could get the plan you didn't choose via other means?<br />
It mentioned you can buy the other at 100, but I think it's only for the Garrison. Would love clarification.<br />
For the garrison, yes. The outpost is currently a one-time decision. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/471756325547180032))<br />
<br />
Breeding pets is no longer a planned feature, right? Is the stable only used to house pets and trainers now?<br />
Its the Menagerie now, and yes, no breeding. It will offer some very cool pet battles bonuses though! (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/471764466875777024))<br />
<br />
I hope there will be things you can place in your Garrison that you can get in various ways. Boss drops, lootable rare objects<br />
Monuments are currently planned to unlock via achievements. Buildings and followers come from MANY sources. Keep in mind, the focus of the garrison is gameplay. Customization is very cool, but not the main draw.(Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/471764588581896193))<br />
<br />
Are you still considering allowing us to move the Garrisons to another zone at max level, or is that now completely scrapped?<br />
No plans for that at launch, could always happen in the future though. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/471765101243281411))<br />
<br />
Reading part 1 of the Garrison blog it seems like you can't opt out without it drastically hurting your experience.<br />
What in particular gave you that reaction? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471745484374020098))<br />
raise an army capable of toppling the Iron Horde, and the Garrison is integral to that experience<br />
That's accurate in terms of the story though. Your mission in Draenor is to build a base and rally an army against the Iron Horde. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471747040041377792))<br />
If you just want to run dungeons or do BGs or whatever else and then raid/PvP/etc. at 100, though, you can absolutely do that. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/471747136187412480))<br />
<br />
I think I asked this before, but how do garrisons events works. is there conditions to trigger an event or gain new enemies?<br />
Yep, various conditions, not quite ready to talk about them yet. Ideally, it feels like a response to YOUR actions in Draenor. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/471894440705921024))<br />
<br />
You guys may have answered this elsewhere but will garrisons have their own banks?<br />
You can access your bank from the Storehouse, or one of the Stables specializations. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/472088006690484224))<br />

And I'm pretty happy to see a crafting mats tab- hopefully we won't have to pay to unlock it so any of our rerolls will have access to it right away. One of the reasons I have guilds is because I need all that extra storage just for crafting mats, so it'll be great to shift that out of there and to my crafting characters. <br />
<br />
I'm not really sure I care for the idea that I won't be able to walk up to a trainer and buy the profession unlock for 601-675 but will have to instead rely on the profession book to drop in a timely manner (AHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAH) and must drag every alt through the hour long introduction to Draenor to farm mobs for the book drops whether or not I want to level them any time soon. It looks like even crafting professions might have that treatment since there's an Alchemy book there. I guess this might also mean all profession patterns are going to be discoveries like alchemy was in MoP? I guess alts getting profession levels before being in the expansion they were from was a huge problem that cried out for a solution?</div></div><hr />

I would tthink it is mainly due to the fact that quite a bit of the gear folks have acquired over the years is no longer obtainable and they want to keep it which is hard when one has collected a lot of things over the years.. One main one is the special Arcanite Ripper that turned you into that undead guitar dude you got out of Kara during the WOTLK launch event.. Though it does seem you can obtain it from those boxes from the Black Market AH..<br />

Not true. I just never entered Elwynn Forest. I didn't actually know how to get south from Dun Morogh. I'm upset that Hogger is so popular even though every race has a Hogger equal. Damned Humans.</div></div><hr />

It is only if you chose a specific scenario. If you do random scenarios it hasn´t been changed.<br />

People were facerolling ( literally 30 seconds) a certain scenario.<br />

So glad that the community has convinced blizzard that every player has millions of gold to spend on their shit.<br />
<br />
duh, you realize these plans will mostly all be free.<br />
<br />
This is what I don´t get about complainers. They complain because Garrisons are ´forced´ onto them... then they complain about the costs of buildings if they don´t want to do garrisons as part of your normal gameplay. If you don´t want to do Garrisons.. then who cares how much the building plans cost... you said you don´t want to do them.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Yeah? well, maybe around 6.0 we hope to start paying a full $15 a month. Until the work we were promised is done.&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean, why not? We CAN'T get away with paying $5 or $10 a month for this, because they won't take any less.. But we have to deal with getting less than promised? Or led to?<br />
They can get away with &quot;not doing this&quot; or &quot;not putting that out&quot;. Whatever the case maybe, they get to do it, but we don't?</div></div><hr />

What exactly is the problem?<br />
MoP model: One new set model per tier and one per season (per class).<br />
WoD model: One new set model per Normal/Heroic tier/season and one per Mythic tier/Elite (not counting LFR sets).<br />
In case you're somehow confused about this, the shared set models will not share textures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had the same thought about making transmog work the same way as it does in D3. Don't think it should be destroyed as some people might actually want to keep the item itself for some reason. Should probably make it so they have to deposit it first to unlock it for use so people can't just pass around one item and all get the visual. <br />
<br />
Also wouldn't be opposed (If they did make it work like D3) to them making the transmog stuff ya found be account wide so ya wouldn't have to farm the same thing multiple times for other characters, with some restrictions of course(CM Sets/Other Classes Tier&amp;PvP Sets, Etc).</div></div><hr />

Doesn't matter what people in your guild do, it's a character based bank. Personal. It's confirmed that you can craft with materials from your bank without needing to withdraw in WoD.</div></div><hr />

1. It's Alpha/Beta. Everything is a rough draft.<br />
2. It's no different than Void Storage.<br />

Silvermoon is a cardboard cut-out. There's no point and as said in other threads, blizzard would have to remodel not just the city, but entire zone as well as Quel'Danas since the damage stretches out there. All that wasted resource for a tiny cosmetic change that is only seen by alts and lowbies who visit those two zones to begin with.</div></div><hr />

Myself and most of the people I've played with since Vanilla have referred to Crafting materials as both &quot;Crafting Mats&quot; and &quot;Crafting Reagents&quot; since 2005.<br />

Hogger is a well-respected joke within the WoW community (even though &quot;well-respected joke&quot; may be an oxymoron). I must say, I'm pretty excited about it after the crappy copy and paste buff we got the last few years. <br />
I've always had a soft spot for Hogger jokes.<br />

For perspective, that reagent tab is equivalent to 35x Royal Satchels' (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/82446-royal-satchel) worth of storage (with today's stacking system of 20).<br />
Try complaining about that, WoW community.<br />
