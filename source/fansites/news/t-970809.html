Addon Review: GTFO<br />
GTFO (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/gtfo.aspx) is an addon that will be useful to anyone who does PvE, especially those of you that play with Spell Detail level turned down. It will warn you when you are standing in something that you shouldn't be, even in content from Vanilla to Firelands. The alert is just audio currently, but it does expand functionality when used with a few other addons. If you play with sounds off, it can unmute sounds to give you the alert as well. <br />
<br />
The warnings come in four different categories, including High/Low for damage amounts, Failure for when you stood in the fire for too long, and Friendly Fire for when you need to get away from someone in the raid who is doing damage to you.<br />
<br />
It has the option to turn off the alert for easy content and integrates with Recount (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/recount.aspx)/Skada (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/skada.aspx) to save statistics and see who is failing the most. The damage amounts will not be fully accurate in all cases, but the counters should be.<br />
<br />

<br />
It also works with Power Auras Classic (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/powerauras-classic.aspx) to provide a visual indicator when you are standing in something! Adding this alert just takes a few steps that are clearly outlined on the download page. Doing &quot;/gtfo test&quot;, &quot;/gtfo test2&quot;, &quot;/gtfo test3&quot;, &quot;/gtfo test4&quot; will let you trigger a test of the damage alerts to ensure the volume and graphic are working as you intended. <br />

<br />
Be sure that you don't use LUI with it, as there are some incompatibility issues in the current version. If you are already using it you need to remove the Recount data from your WTF folder for each character. &quot;/gtfo options&quot; will get you right into the options screen. Give it a try (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/gtfo.aspx) and let us know what you think!<br />

Most people would probably agree that there's nothing inherently wrong with Running Wild, so what's wrong with Plainstriding? If it was implemented in the same way as the Worgen, obviously. You can complain about how bad Plainstriding WAS, but that's irrelevant to a conversation about it being reimplemented because it would never come back the way it was in beta.</div></div><hr />

I vaguely remember that when it was announced worgen would not be getting a mount the Alliance was all about &quot;but what about 100 mount challenge! It'll be easier for the Horde now! At least give us some recolors you mean Horde-favoring Blizzard!!! It's all about the achievement!!&quot; and now it's... suddenly not about the achievement?</div></div><hr />

Lets all riot because spoiled kids dont get their special snowflake mount , kids have over 150 mounts to pick but hey lets all whine and QQ about some mounts people will forget in 2 months just like TRH</div></div><hr />

They're not even reskinned. You can go ahead and say &quot;oh, they're something Blizzard is being nice by putting in!&quot;, but uhm, it still doesn't make it less unfair that the ugly Horde Goblins got one of the best mounts, arguably, in the game for their racial mount (thus available to the entire Horde for use), while the Alliance just get... absolutely nothing to compensate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe quite a few of us care less about them using existing models, but more about which models they have chosen. People have already found unused horse models in the game files (that have been there since vanilla) that could be used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They DID put effort into something new... it's called &quot;Running Wild&quot; and no other race in the game has it. To me, the worgen horse mount is a placeholder for the achievement, and nothing more. I'm pretty sure this is how Blizzard views it as well, seeing as how, like you said, there was little effort put into it.</div></div><hr />

Fact: they are only good as achievemetn counter Fact: as achieve counter i dont give a * what it is Fact: worgens still have an unique cool &quot;mount&quot; that blizz put a ton of effort in be happy you got your achievement counter equal now and move along</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some one seems to have forgotten all of the QQ that happened about alliance having the Winterspring Sabers. Generalizatoins are annoying and ignorant - the complaining is all the same on both sides.<br />
<br />
This leads me to believe a new mount achivement is in order. They balanced counts in Wrath, no reason to not do it again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocturnes</div><div class="date">2011-09-05, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason Blizzard uses horses is because they want to keep the alliance players from going too much into a fantasy world. Riding horses is natural, riding chickens and .....But to be serious, it's not alliance, it's all of us, we all want to be a special snowflake, we all want things our way, we moan about everything, it's always something. Sure, blizz uses loads of revamped stuff this expansion, hell, we have been moaning about it for the entire expansion already. Each 3.4minutes a new thread is created about why they are quiting wow or why blizz failed or wtf blizz is doing. People need to justify why they want to stop playing this game, if it's not on the forums, they didn't get permission to quit. We all point fingers to eachother, it's true. This game has gone real-life style. Too much democracy was never good, and it's the same now. You get the rights to speak, wich you do, but actualy nothing is said...we are all like ordinary people who go 100x to the same restaurant, if we have a good dinner 99x we won't speak, yet, we will qq loads about that 1x. It's time we get happy with little things,...you don't? Go play another game, loads are coming out soon! Merry Christmas</div></div><hr />

Are you for real dude. It is a unique mount. Helloooooo YOU are the mount, just because they implemented as a racial ability is a irrelevant .

<br />
The ONLY justified critique that occured during the announcement was reguarding how bad an idea it was to announce the additional mounts in the manner they did, and a Blue more or less conceeded this by stating that there was an internal misunderstanding about the &quot;feature&quot;, but this criticism was by far and away the LEAST mentioned one.<br />
<br />
The most popular complaints were:<br />
&quot;This is lazy, there's nothing new here&quot;<br />
and<br />
&quot;omg, have can the devs waste time on this&quot;.<br />
<br />
Two complaints which contradict each other. Yeah, the complainers were spot on weren't they? If you want to continue bitching about laziness, then please explain what mount would make sense, remember, Gineans are humans, and English based, why were shire horses a surprise?</div></div><hr />

Edit: dont take me wrong im just joking a bit;) with Baine but man im serious with Blizzard. No recolouring or anything? Why make a big news about this? Only mount farmers will buy this crap.

They told us about mounts which are exactly the same as ones we have already!Hopefully, this just means we've getting a new mount achievement in 4.3, i'd like a decent reason to go past 100, aside from getting the mounts you actually want ofc. For most alliance, these will be 2 extra towards the count, regardless of what they look like but really, these are the same as the horses we already have, if people can't see that that's just lazy, well....They may be larger than the human horses, which would be nice, and would make them sufficiently different for many (of course not all though)</div></div><hr />

I think you are missing the point here. The kodo was maybe not a new model, but at least there isn’t a shitload of them all over the place. <br />
Let’s make a breakdown of the horses pre 4.3 : <br />
<br />
Racial mounts for human : <br />
5 slow horses (brown, chestnut, pinto, brown mare, black stallion) <br />
3 fast horses (swift palomino, swift brown, swift white) <br />
<br />
Pvp : black warsteed <br />
<br />
Argent tournament : <br />
Swift grey steed <br />
Stormwind steed <br />
Queldorei steed <br />
Argent warhorse <br />
<br />
ToC : <br />
Swift alliance steed<br />
Crusaders white warhorse <br />
<br />
ICC: <br />
Invincible (LK hc) <br />
Crimson deathcharger (Shadowmourne goodie bag) <br />
<br />
Class specific: <br />
Dk deathcharger <br />
Paladin chargers (3) <br />
Warlock dreadsteeds (2) <br />
<br />
Other : <br />
Swift Zhevra (RaF - discontinued) <br />
Celestial steed (blizz store) <br />
Fiery Warhorse (Karazhan)<br />
Headless horseman <br />
Spectral steed (Tolbarad) <br />
<br />
(don't know if i miss any now, but that would only strengthen my point) <br />
<br />
Okay you can argue that some of them are really unique and some of them are capable of flying, but don’t you think we had enough horses already? I didn’t include the skeletal horses because they are horde mounts, nor the rivendare charger.</div></div><hr />

In other words, you didn't &quot;Mount&quot; plainsrunning, you ran for about 10 seconds and then all of a sudden you'd start going at mount speed. It was OP and awkward, that's why they said fuck it and did away with it, giving tauren's mounts. Btw, the plainsrunning animation was just the tauren sprinting animation, and it looked ridiculous. Running Wild however, makes sense, and Worgen mobs ran the same way pre cata. They have their own animation for it, unlike plains running, and running wild works like ordinary mounts. 1.5 seconds cast. No reason to remove it or change it because it's not broken like plains running was. It seems pretty lame to add these mounts into the game now... mountain of mounts is still obtainable without them, i don't see the point in adding 2 mounts with a different name that share the EXACT same model as 2 others. Tauren still have 6 mounts to Worgen's 3, but at least we're beating out goblins now, but not in the uniqueness department.</div></div><hr />

Not a single race shares race mount type, so in that respec if Worgen by game standards are &quot;new race&quot; then giving them horses without saddle with the same textures as human's one is just pure laziness on Blizzard part!<br />

<br />
And you are forgetting one thing - Worgen's dont share their racial mount with anyone. The Worgen's racial mount is called Running Wild. Instead of changing your model to one of your character riding a horse, it changes your model to one where your character is a quadraped able to dash around at high speed. The coolest thing about this mount is that no other race can ever have it or anything that remotely resembles it. <br />
<br />
The only disadvantage of this new coolest racial mount in the game is that it it made it very marginally more difficult for Alliance players to get a particular achivement. Despite the fact that achivements are pretty meaningless and that the lack of those two extra racial mounts didn't actually make the achievement impossible to get, Blizzard decided to be nice and give two extra mounts to the worgen. <br />
<br />
All that happened here was a slight PR mistake where the people in charge of publicity over-hyped something that wasn't really intended to be hyped up at all.</div></div><hr />

I was not surprised at all, but more rather bothered that they are not distinguishable between any other horse in the game. Aside from the saddle being removed. They could have just as easily put in a checkered box to replace the mount because nobody will use them. It is rather annoying that they simply made these two pathetic mounts as filler for an achievement. The first time they did is with the horde mounts, and yet they took the time to recolor them. <br />
<br />
There was concept art floating around hinting at a real Gilneas reputation mount. Until it was scrapped entirely without a word. They could have been creative yet they choose not to for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
It is a lazy act to fix a tiny problem. <br />
<br />
<br />
Are you for real dude. It is a unique mount. Helloooooo YOU are the mount, just because they implemented as a racial ability is a irrelevant . Would it mean that much to you to go in the mount tab and click on a picture of yourself. Its mind boggling that your even trying to defend the whiners.<br />
Bottom line is your an idiot. Get over it brah.<br />
<br />
You obviously have no idea what you're even trying to argue about and missed the picture entirely.<br />

<br />

As a PLAYER of this GAME, I am completely baffled about the lack of creativity and care shown for these horses...they use the Black Stallion and the Brown Horse, both already in use in-game, to &quot;even out&quot; the numbers in mounts between the 2 factions. Oook...and what would have been so hard with letting them use the EPIC horse models, but with gilnean armor and some new colour? I don't think it would have been hard at all. I play both factions since this is game and if you do not experience all of it, you might as well quit, and I find the reactions &quot;Hey be grateful, they added them to even out numbers!&quot; to be pathetic. Talk about brown noses.....And the Daily Blink is also very childish since it points out only the Worgen as &quot;whiners&quot;, when an entire community of WOW PLAYERS, screw the factions they happen to play, are tired of seeing Blizzard being lazy. These mounts could have been at least nice to look at and really show that Blizzard care about the Worgen, but no....sure, I find the goblin trikes ugly and badly animated, but giving 2 factions the same horses = REALLY lazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They weren't trying to give you anything different. And Recolors are quick. Implementing a whole new model is not. Getting art time for a recolor probably was a lot easier than if they'd ordered up something special.<br />
At least you got it quick. Horde waited for years before they got their Frostsaber equivalent and it was another Raptor.<br />
<br />
<br />
My guild has required this addon since its first release (or close to, my memory's a bit spotty there). That addon is quite handy because I sometimes tunnel vision. When that happens, all it takes is that alarm sound to &quot;wake&quot; me up to the surroundings. I really recommend getting the addon.<br />
<br />
Yep. GTFO should be required for every raid. And every 5 man for that matter. I've been using it since around it's release as you get trained real quick to move without even thinking if you hear that siren go off. Saves a lot of healer mana and battle rezzes when you get moving instantly instead of having to wait until you shift focus enough to notice your health is dropping like a rock or that your feet have suddenly become immersed in something bad.</div></div><hr />

Yeeeeeeah...that's really debatable. I've got two goblins and neither one of them has taken out their racial mount since getting exalted with another Horde race. They just look too damned goofy.<br />

A worgen riding a worgen? As they did for the Tauren they gave them a model that was already seen throughout Molgore which was the Kodo, the only model I can think of other than the horse that is seen around Gilneas is a Fox and I doubt you can hop on top of a Fox. None of the animals there were transformed like the Worgen were either, so they would just be making up some BS mount for you guys and then the lore freaks would come out of the woodwork and complain that it doesn't fit in at all.

I play Alliance and my main is a human. I don't even care and cared about the imbalanced mount number. I knew Blizzard would balance it someday (but not how) and an additional number of horses will not ruin my gameplay. <br />

Also about the mounts, well imo i think blizz did advertise it the wrong way, throwing in a few screenshots and a load of fucking bullshit blue posts DID make it look like it was something new that just hit the shelves, in fact i believe blizz intentions was to make people think oh yea new mounts sweet ill shut up now but with it kinda backfireing a tiny little .....well thats no problem to them as they already had some reason as backup ie 'well we threw them in there to just make up the numbers.'

Wish they had given fido an orcish worg mount instead, it would have provided for a little more comical value than seeing a dog riding a donkey. Whats even more unfair is that it will actually be a 2 passanger land mount, according to this early concept art of the mount: http://shop.wullinger.net/images/400124.jpg?osCsid=0c97c3e7be85e92229130118f575af87</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeeeep.<br />
<br />
This is a miss for DB this time around. The majority of the complaints isn't because &quot;but waaah mounts&quot; but is a critique of the fact that this is the laziest set of mounts that they've ever put in the game.<br />
<br />
I don't think a lot of people whining about the complaints (IE, the people who are agreeing with the Daily Blink comic) are quite getting this, but as it's been analyzed and observed by many it's the lack of quality content produced at reasonable amounts of time that's slowly bleeding WoW of its subscriber base. The Worgen mounts are a big, shining example of this shift of work ethic by Blizzard. The effort they put into this is painfully obvious compared to previous &quot;for mount count per faction balance purposes&quot; mounts put into the game.<br />
<br />
We are issuing complaint because we know Blizzard has and can do better, but they're not.</div></div><hr />

Black and brown ooooh special. We can already buy a black and brown horse. Oooooh. Special. Oooh. I just hate the kodo colors chosen, there are a LOVELY purple and teal coloration for 2 Kodos. Kodos just need an upgraded model and I'd love them more. Also. Black War Kodo needs to outshine the Brewfest Kodo. It's pathetic how dull and rusted it is, compared to the Brewfest kodo. Utterly horrible. <br />

It's not going to stop stupidity. It's not really going to help tunnel vision. And you can get something pretty much like that with DBM, no? Mean it warns me about mechanics and when shit hits the fan. Tho seriously, if DBM can't stop people from being stupid, this won't either. I don't know why people keep investing and wasting time to help people who purposely stand in the fire. And don't believe me? Friend of mine while gearing up, got think it was Grim Batol, HC. The tank died 10 times on the orc/dragon fight. Ten. God. Damn. Times. Some people just need to learn the saying; You can lead a horse to water, BUT YOU CAN NOT MAKE IT DRINK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The addon is not useless, I use it for months and it really helps in some cases where you might have focused too much on some aspect of an encounter and you took your mind off some source of harm for a moment.<br />
<br />
It is not an addon that teaches people to move out of the fire, it is an addon that reminds you that you stand in the fire</div></div><hr />

Heh worgen people complaining about the ordinary mount when plainsrunning was replaced by a standard Mulgore/Barrens/Desolace mob which is obviously not the same situation!!111<br />

You see.. that's what really bothers me about this.<br />
<br />
Does anybody remember the Real-ID backlash using real names? Does anybody remember the Insane in the Membrane debackle? <br />
<br />
What happened in BOTH of those cases? Blizz said &quot;OK - we hear you loud and clear and see your points, and you are right. We'll re-change them back!&quot;<br />
<br />
However, despite hearing a significant backlash (probably more than the backlash to Insane in the Membrane!) Blizzard, for the first time, chooses NOT to see the player's perspective and instead passes the buck onto miscommunication?! That's literally like a Politician being caught with a Prostitute, and him saying &quot;no no no! You misunderstood - she was only giving me a massage is all!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm really surprised Blizz is doing this. I was at least expecting them to say &quot;OK, we see the complaints and we'll keep these for placeholders for now... at a later point we'll change them into grey/black horses with Gilnean Armor.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a huge difference between these mounts and those situations though.<br />
<br />
The only reason they added these in was to even the count. That's IT. No other reason. They aren't looking to give Alliance something new and shiny to stare at, just to curb the complaints that the count was uneven again. Horses were the only thing that made sense to recolor / add in, in relation to worgen. Could they have added mounts somewhere else for the count, unrelated to Worgen? Sure. But then people would have complained about the fact that they just got more recolored Elekks, robochickens, cats, or whatever. Why would they get brand new models when this is not the Worgen RACIAL mount. <br />
<br />
They had to add an extra post just to clarify that they ONLY added these in to even the count and didn't they add ANOTHER clarification post about the fact they only announced it the way they did so people would be aware it was shoved in there, rather than having to stumble into the vendor? It boggles my mind how people are still complaining when there was literally NO other reason for them to do this except the achievement count.<br />
<br />
I do get the complaint about all the horses. But... what do you honestly expect? Horses are the number one creature ridden by humans. You know, real ones? Of course they are everywhere.<br />
<br />
But, anyway. While I get the point of The Daily Blink's joke, it goes a little too far. Personally, I like Kodo's, anyway. I just wish they were more interesting colors. Or awesomely painted/armored like the pally Kodos.</div></div><hr />
