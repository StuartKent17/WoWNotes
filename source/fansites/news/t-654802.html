Faction-Change Service in the Works<br />
We wanted to give everyone a very early heads-up that, in response to player requests, we’re developing a new service for World of Warcraft that will allow players to change their faction from Alliance to Horde or Horde to Alliance. There’s still much work to do and many details to iron out, but the basic idea is that players will be able to use the service to transform an existing character into a roughly equivalent character of the opposing faction on the same realm. Players who ended up creating and leveling up characters on the opposite factions from their friends have been asking for this type of functionality for some time, and we’re pleased to be getting closer to being able to deliver it.<br />
<br />
As with all of the features and services we offer, we intend to incorporate the faction-change service in a way that won’t disrupt the gameplay experience on the realms, and there will be some rules involved with when and how the service can be used. The number of variables involved increases the complexity of implementing this service, but we plan to take the time needed to ensure that it lives up to expectations before officially rolling it out. We’ll go into much more detail on all of this here at http://www.WorldofWarcraft.com (http://www.WorldofWarcraft.com) as development progresses. In the meantime, we wanted to let you know that because this type of functionality requires extensive internal testing well in advance of release, you may be seeing bits and pieces of the service in the test builds we use for the public test realms moving forward. <br />
<br />
Patch 3.2 - PTR Build 10048<br />
A new build has been deployed on test realms, stay tuned for more changes!<br />

Blood<br />
Bloody Strikes: This talent now provides 5/10/15% increased damage to Blood Strike instead of 15/30/45%.<br />
Unholy Blight: This talent has been redesigned. It no longer deals damage to nearby targets. Instead, when you deal damage with Death Coil, the target will take periodic damage for 10 seconds equal to 20% of the damage done by Death Coil. This damage accumulates in the same way as Ignite and Deep Wounds.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=620) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />

In addition, the damage-over-time effect is now considered a melee attack instead of a spell attack.<br />
<br />
Protection<br />
Ardent Defender: Redesigned. Any damage that takes the paladin below 35% health or below is reduced. This reduction applies only to the portion that pushes the paladin below 35% health (example: a paladin at 50% health takes a 40% hit; the first 15% hits as normal while the next 25% is reduced). In addition, once every 2 minutes an attack that would have killed the paladin will fail to kill, and instead set the paladin's health to 10/20/30% of maximum.<br />
<br />
Retribution<br />
Crusader Strike: Damage reduced to 75% weapon damage to match the new 4-second cooldown. Mana cost reduced to 5% of base mana.<br />

Fury<br />
Bloodsurge: Notification that Slam has become instant now appears in floating combat text.<br />
<br />
Protection<br />
Devastate: Weapon damage increased to 60% and bonus per Sunder Armor on the target increased by 20%.<br />
Shield Specialization: Now provides 5 rage on a block, dodge or parry instead of 2 rage on a block.<br />
<br />
Graphics<br />
The frame rate for those with Shadow Effects enabled under the Ultra Video settings has been improved.<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Engineering<br />
Added a new Mind Amplification Dish attachment for helmets, allowing engineers to control other humanoid targets. Some restrictions apply: does not work in Arenas, dish sometimes reverses targets, unable to stack with other stat-improving head enchantments and makes your helmet look... stylish?<br />
The Cobalt Frag Bomb now incapacitates enemies within a 3-yard radius. A short cast time was added, but they are usable while moving. This change applies to any Cobalt Frag Bombs already created. The existing recipe now makes 3 at a time.<br />
Engineers can now learn to create a portable Wormhole Generator for Northrend. The Wormhole allows them to travel to different locations in Northrend, although the locations are sometimes in dangerous places.<br />
A new repair bot has been added, and his name is Jeeves. He is the ultimate gentleman robot butler, able to perform all the mundane tasks of repairing, selling and buying junk for your entire raid. Additionally, he can open bank boxes for skilled engineers (350+). Jeeves is not destroyed when used, but due to pressing engagements, can only be summoned once an hour. The schematic for this handsome robot was said to be hidden within the parts of another robot - hoping to be found by an engineer one day.<br />
Reduced the materials needed to create all engineering Dragonlings, and reduced their cooldowns, although they still cannot be used in Arenas.<br />
A Steam-Powered Auctioneer has been added to the Dalaran Like Clockwork engineering shop, allowing access to one's faction Auction House. The Steam-Powered Auctioneer was programmed with a superiority chip, and will only interact with Grand Master engineers.</div></div><hr />

i love the change, but i can see the problems involved,<br />
Mounts: will you loose all your mounts? some? get equivilents?<br />
Titles: if youve done the agent tourney achievements will there be orcs with &quot;of Stormwind &quot; titles<br />
Acheivements : Such as loremaster, or titles above, or the killing of enemy faction leaders<br />

<br />
Equivilents I assume? <br />
<br />
<br />
Titles: if youve done the agent tourney achievements will there be orcs with &quot;of Stormwind &quot; titles<br />
<br />
Probably would translate. SW = UC, IF = Org, ect.. ect..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Acheivements : Such as loremaster, or titles above, or the killing of enemy faction leaders<br />
<br />
Translate. If you killed Org boss, You'd get credit for killing IF boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gear: With faction specific gear coming soon, how would they sort that out?<br />
<br />
Easy. T9 alliance legs = T9 Horde legs<br />

<br />
They would have to implement restrictions of either forcing you to delete the other characters, or faction change them as well.<br />
<br />
One concern I see is how this change would affect the more imbalanced servers, such as Silvermoon - EU (http://www.warcraftrealms.com/census.php?serverid=349). They would most likely have to implement one way restrictions to prevent H -&gt; A changes to prevent that server from being completely one-sided.</div></div><hr />

My guess is that you will not be allowed to do it on a PvP realm, if you have more characters there. Although it's possible to have both Horde and Alliance on the same PvP realm if a GM screw up :P</div></div><hr />

Idk about that- alliance racials are extremely powerful + my GF and I have both considered rerolling alliance<br />

so now (since this probly wont be available for pvp servers) we can xfer 2 of our chars to another server and then go alliance, free 80 alliance for 40$ (assuming 25 for xfer and 15 for faction change)</div></div><hr />

Interresting thing really, If im a human mage there are several possible horde races available, Troll, Undead, Blood Elf all can be mages, but for my Human Paladin theres only one choice.

I just don't really know what to think about this. I don't think it's... a BAD thing. It's hardly pandering to casuals, and unlike what some say, it's not like giving away epics or loot etc for a fee. Such a change would just be so immensely complicated - stats, gear, achievements, reputation, faction-specific quests, Loremaster, racial abilities, being able to choose a race. What is the cooldown like? Should it be allowed for level-capped characters? What about PvP-city raid achievements?<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard may be undertaking something a little overly-daunting for a feature that isn't really needed - but would certainly be loved.</div></div><hr />

If you don't want to use it...it very likely won't affect you at all.<br />

It's honestly better for hardcore raiders than &quot;casuals&quot; as now you can recruit cross-faction.</div></div><hr />

why would you make faction changes if you only just made it EVEN MORE COMPLICATED<br />
i love the change, but i can see the problems involved,<br />
Mounts: will you loose all your mounts? some? get equivilents?<br />
Titles: if youve done the agent tourney achievements will there be orcs with &quot;of Stormwind &quot; titles<br />
Acheivements : Such as loremaster, or titles above, or the killing of enemy faction leaders<br />
Gear: With faction specific gear coming soon, how would they sort that out?<br />
<br />
dont get me wrong, i LOVE this change, but they are making things harder for themselves :p<br />
<br />
<br />
The downside I suppose.. will be that you will loose any race spesific achievements if not all.<br />
And therefore it wont be something you do on a regular basis if you care about achievements so much (I don't.. but I'm happt with my class and race so w/e)<br />
<br />
And for.. <br />
<br />
<br />
So, when will they allow any class to be any race?<br />
<br />
Transfer between races, will make you able to choose a new race maybe xD?<br />
Well.. I donno, soon I suppose since with this kind of system (tho as said, it is just on the test phase or at all just an idea atm)<br />
changins race between ally and horde wont automaticly grant you an human if your undea I suppose you gotta choose ;o<br />
--<br />
Oh and DANG troll berserker buff (or depends nerf for those heavy pvp troll healers or?)!<br />
20% guaranteed is still very very nice for pve, since you wont usually go below 40% (it is 40% right? or 60?) to get the 30% anyway.<br />

Now he'll be able to switch them over to horde and (presumably) transfer them over.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that if you are on a PvP server they won't allow you to switch sides and have toons on both sides unless you switch them all. As someone else mentioned I would bet on a cooldown similar to the one realm transfers have.</div></div><hr />

I thought that but I'm thinking they would have pointed that out to us. Plus just because a server is out of balance, why would players suddenly volunteer to switch sides?

While I'm a bit upset I'm now sitting on 50 of them, I guess it makes sense to turn a rare red into an epic red, instead of making cheap greens into them. But the cooldown would have been enough, since it still would take weeks to turn all those FE's into the Cardinals with that change.<br />
<br />
As for the faction change, meh. It's so easy to level now and easier in 3.2 that rolling an alt is not hard at all. If you want to play with friends so bad they'll carry your ass to get you geared.</div></div><hr />

okay.....lets get some things straight. I'm one of those people who you targeted up there who were too &quot;lazy&quot; to reroll, recently i leveled a belf pally from 1-80 legit but now im faced with the daunting task of catching up on the 6k achievement pts* (a good bit of which that were from vanilla and raiding throughout multiple expansions.), reputations, gear, and proving my creditability on a new faction, i have to say that a large portion of the people you tried to pigeonhole has no part in them being &quot;lazy&quot; as much as it is difficult to replicate a character that is long since established in the game. For those who are afraid of the conversions for certain faction-only items, it is a lot more simple than you may think. As someone has previously stated, each city faction has its own horde/alliance counterpart, with the new implimentation of the Venomhide Ravasaur (hopefully in 3.2) the Wspring Frostsaber will now be easily interchangable, and mounts can either be turned into tokens you can redeem, or just be reimbursed for them. Remember this is a paid service and most likely blizzard will have every single aspect covered.</div></div><hr />

At the cost of in game gold you may create a character that is 10 or more levels below your current one of the same class, any race/faction on any server (transfer rules apply). This character starts with green gear, an amount of gold depending on level, appropriate skill in First Aid (not to exceed your own), and a few starter items like Hearthstone, food/water, bandages. You may give your new character additional gold not to exceed some amount depending on level (to discourage gold farmers from moving gold around), and any BOE or account bound gear (pvp gear is automatically changed if necessary).<br />

If a character is created as Horde he will go through diffrent content than if he was alliance.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Herecius</div><div class="date">2009-06-29, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some things that games should stick to. One of it is the fundemental part of the entire design. It might have been long time ago - but WOW is a two faction contested game and the RPG content of the entire game is build around it. I think any gaming company should always value the RPG part of their games. WOW is not doing that with these changes.<br />
<br />
If a character is created as Horde he will go through diffrent content than if he was alliance. If the content of the game is no longer strong enough to support the game (ppl to lazy to create and lvl other faction) then they should just stick to their earlier characters. Switching sides... should never be an option. <br />
<br />
Finally, an argument that makes sense instead of 'QQ pandering to casuals QQ.'<br />
<br />
I think part of the problem is WoW has literally gotten too big to support the standard model of a two-faction MMO like that. I agree that to any player that actually goes through with a faction change, then the change totally devalues the lore content of that entire faction. That said, since it's not an actual 'lore' mechanic, and you'll be switching races as well, I'm inclined to say that it's just the personal choice of whomever goes through with the change, and doesn't have any real impact on the lore of the game. A player that wants to experience the quests can still do it at any level, and I think that a lot of players still do.<br />
<br />
It's something not everybody will do, and I think actually a major minority of players will do.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daedalon</div><div class="date">2009-06-29, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay.....lets get some things straight. I'm one of those people who you targeted up there who were too &quot;lazy&quot; to reroll, recently i leveled a belf pally from 1-80 legit but now im faced with the daunting task of catching up on the 6k achievement pts (a good bit of which that were from vanilla and raiding throughout multiple expansions.), reputations, gear, and proving my creditability on a new faction, i have to say that a large portion of the people you tried to pigeonhole has no part in them being &quot;lazy&quot; as much as it is difficult to replicate a character that is long since established in the game. For those who are afraid of the conversions for certain faction-only items, it is a lot more simple than you may think. As someone has previously stated, each city faction has its own horde/alliance counterpart, with the new implimentation of the Venomhide Ravasaur (hopefully in 3.2) the Wspring Frostsaber will now be easily interchangable, and mounts can either be turned into tokens you can redeem, or just be reimbursed for them. Remember this is a paid service and most likely blizzard will have every single aspect covered.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im sorry m8 but if you really have a character that has alot of achievements then I hope you also realise that those acheivements were finished as a part of the OTHER faction in the game. You desided to play that faction and play against the other faction. THats the RPG part about mmoRPGs. Just like you desided to play a warrior or like you desided to play a shaman. Im sorry if you do not realise this. But you desided what race - what class -and what faction you wanted to play. None of these basics should ever be changed. Cause if you start to change one - then you can in no way say that you can't change the others. And that is exactly what BLizzard is now facing. <br />
<br />
Why can't a character that has been playing shaman become a priest now if he wants to heal ? That character might have alot of achievments but Blizzard is favoring priests now (with the double spec ability you can be best single target healer and best group healer so guarantied raid spot) so ... Why can't I switch CLASS ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take my server, the alliance to horde ratio is about 7:1 alliance favor, the horde struggle in almost every guild to get the people raid 25 man content, they too stubborn to merge guilds, 80% of that population of horde is not even really good enough to raid 10 man let alone 25 man, if a faction change happened, you would see most of the horde switch to alliance, I think its a guarantee what end game raiding guilds (if you call it that) their is would jump up and switch.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is it favors some factions and servers.<br />
<br />
Now if they were to limit it where only alliance could switch over and not the horde on some servers, it would have a more positive effect.</div></div><hr />

Just some speculations.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this is probably the main viable choice that Blizz has available. For Example - Draenai Shaman wants to go horde side, thus options would be Orc, Tauren, or Troll.<br />
<br />
I definitely forsee a ton of complications that could arise, and therefore don't even see this as something coming in 3.2, but maybe 3.3. I also don't see this as a bad thing, per se. I think there are a lot of servers out there that are underpopulated and allowing a faction change could potentially add to the raiding population and maybe allow 2 solid guilds to form into a great one. How many servers out there didn't even get a chance to see Kil'Jaedan before the big nerf. Hell, some couldn't even kill him afterwards. A few good players from the the other faction and this changes everthing.<br />
<br />
As far as the whole achievement thing...I donn't think, at least other than the faction type stuff that it will need to be changed. Hell, I'd even go as far as to say, if you change, you don't get exalted with your citieis, even if you were exalted before. There are just some things that need to be earned.<br />
<br />
And for those that whined becasue they rerolled...who cares. This is why Blizz is doing it, so you don't have to do it in the future, so youand others as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No. It'll still work off the base damage. Maybe (I doubt it, could be a little OP) they'd set it up where it's adjusted based on your crit chance.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, you'd run into one of 2 problems. First would be that Chimera Shot would have to know beforehand how many times SS will crit, which would kinda kill the whole random number thing (and could actually result in a miniature paradox... If Chimera Shot does it's damage based on SS critting twice, but the mob dies before SS crits the second time, then that would be odd, to say the least. Likewise if I refresh SS before the second crit)<br />
<br />
Alternately, Chimera could deal damage based on the number of times SS has already critted in that particular rotation, but I doubt they'd do that... It'd go completely against the way the shot currently works.</div></div><hr />

There’s still much work to do and many details to iron out, but the basic idea is that players will be able to use the service to transform an existing character into a roughly equivalent character of the opposing faction on the same realm. Players who ended up creating and leveling up characters on the opposite factions from their friends have been asking for this type of functionality for some time, and we’re pleased to be getting closer to being able to deliver it.<br />
<br />
As with all of the features and services we offer, we intend to incorporate the faction-change service in a way that won’t disrupt the gameplay experience on the realms, and there will be some rules involved with when and how the service can be used. The number of variables involved increases the complexity of implementing this service, but we plan to take the time needed to ensure that it lives up to expectations before officially rolling it out. We’ll go into much more detail on all of this here at http://www.WorldofWarcraft.com as development progresses. In the meantime, we wanted to let you know that because this type of functionality requires extensive internal testing well in advance of release, you may be seeing bits and pieces of the service in the test builds we use for the public test realms moving forward.<br />

In case you're over looking it the difference between the old and new Blood tap is the following:<br />
<br />
Old:<br />
Immediately activates a Blood Rune and temporarily converts it into a Death Rune. Death Runes count as a Blood, Frost or Unholy Rune.<br />
<br />
New ptr 3.2 (nerf):<br />
Blood Tap now converts a Blood Rune into a Death Rune for the next 20 seconds. (no longer activates the rune, it only converts it)<br />

I would prefer an included transfer to another realm. Else i would have to pay 1x surgery (alli-&gt;horde) and 2x realmtransfer just to get a toon to my realm where i currently play horde.<br />
But this is just ridiculous caus i can buy a big keg of beer for that money and have fun otherwise.<br />
<br />
<br />
they will have it all covered im sure; and either its not available for pvp servers or more likely come with a free server(/account) xfer. Either that or blizzard will cave and make pvp allowed horde + alliance on same account</div></div><hr />

<br />
Name a single WoW service that you can pay for that actually gives your character an advantage in-game.<br />
<br />
Oh wait.<br />
<br />
There aren't any.<br />
<br />
The model of the Asian MMO that does that is because those are generally free-to-play games, which WoW is not, in case that slipped your mind. The stuff like server transfers and this? Almost no effect on gameplay whatsoever, for a few simple reasons:<br />
First off, a minority of people are going to do this. Many players have played one faction for a long, long time, and have no desire to switch. Many more already HAVE high level characters on both factions. This is primarily a feature for new players that have hit 80 and would like to switch their character to the other faction. It doesn't give them a NEW character, it simply saves them the work of doing the exact same thing - twice.<br />
<br />
I honestly see no indication that the next step is 'items/character benefits for money.'</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's about the only real beef I have with this whole design change. <br />

This change seems more about convenience than casual gameplay improvements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks like activision controls all their decisions and more money is more money. <br />

For blizzard its hard as converting players subscription money from euros to dollars.<br />

It makes zero sense to be able to switch faction but not be able to do a race change and remain the same faction. They might as well call it a race-change and you can literally change to ANY race horde/alliance.</div></div><hr />

For the Warcraft 1-3 veterans this is pure blaspheme.<br />
<br />
Those who fell in love with their race. For me, originally Orc. I ended up playing alliance because of a newb friend that played on a server that they wanted to be able to remember, hence I play on bronzebeard. and Like many starting alliance players wanted to play an asthetically pleasing race back in vanilla. So yeah I was playing with a stereotypical alliance friend, I turned by back on my 36 orc hunter and moved on. <br />
<br />
I still remember my first trip into demonfall canyon. The first time seeing mannoroths armor in Org. I chose to play races based on this content.<br />
<br />
Race = Skin color now This is better left for the real word and kept the hell out of RPGs.<br />
<br />
I have been a blizzard fanboy since I was 12 years old taking every change, every development, every announcement, with palms sweating. <br />
<br />
So while I'm glad some of my friends even will benefit from this change and there may be some easier guild recruitment(and more threatening disbands) ahead of us. <br />
<br />
This proves blizzard doesn't give a damn about their creation at all anymore. Money corrupts and I should have saw it coming. So RIP World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
I've always thought would quit wow when arthas lies dead/redeemed at my feet, and now I know. So I'll say it ahead of time Good bye Warcraft. Hello World of Whatever a MMO <br />

I've played blizzard games since before the name was a household term. We may be few and far between, but we are true.

We keep SC alive. We keep WC3(at least dota and td) alive. Congratulations Blizzard, on outgrowing the need for your roots. But I ask you to reconsider, your extra money will not buy back 10+ year customers, I hate the fact I bring up corporations with you but honestly, any company that has been around more than 10 years knows you can not just up and take a crap on your most tenured customers. So keep your statistics about the majority, and the demands of your newer fans to yourself. I shell out that kind of garbage for a living, and I honestly hate my job.

You know what this change means to me (I'm sure some of you won't care and others will gibber about lore!! and some will claim the sky is falling) it means I get to dust off my Alliance Rogue from the pre tbc days, move him to my new home as a Horde and show him some love again.<br />

<br />
So, now about me..<br />
<br />
I to played wc 1/2/3, diablo, sc and the likes, did some q1 and bf1942 and when wow hit jumped on it.<br />
I've been playing ally since the day my account got created on 25th feb 2005.<br />
<br />
And basically, i've had it to here (/me holds hand over his head) with all the ally cities and stuff.<br />
<br />
This for me is a chance to see it from the other side, go to those cities without being killed/shotdown/ganked by guards/players.<br />
<br />
You know, just a change of scenery together with some friend, play on the o so self proclamed &quot;mature&quot; side of the fence.<br />
And no, i don't want to make a new horde hunter/shaman toon, lvl them to 80 with raf, lvl professions, get achievements/mounts/pets/gear and 50k gold, this for me (and i know a few more) is the perfect solution.<br />
<br />
Sure, this is a great way to make even more money, and that is probably one of the big reasons they are doing it.<br />
But there is a target audience out there that would make use of this, get over it Blizzard is a company, they want to make money and if they make it while providing a service to their paying customers and filling a gap in there services i don't fkkin care about it and i sure in hell wouldn't terminate my account for it.<br />
<br />
People that e-rage over this sort of things and going &quot;I'm terminating my account because of this&quot; are already fed up with wow and just need a excuse to do it.</div></div><hr />

war 1, 2, 3, sc, d1, d2, WoW. Played alliance since day one and I'm not sure if it's bad or not. But if there's no good enough raiding guild on alliance side I can... OMG switch sides! And if you check all my posts (yes, there's a few of them I know) you'll find out that I actually know a lot more about WoW and the other games then you.

Horde have always been out numbered sometimes as much as up to 3.5 to 4:1 on some servers. TBC gets released, &quot;Pretty&quot; Blood Elves are introduced to the Horde. The flood of Yugio playing, teenage mutant ninja turtle loving, card carrying instant self gratifying children pour over from Alliance in the chance to &quot;infect&quot; the glorious Horde....and it worked. Server faction ratios come down...even as low as 2-2.5:1 in some cases...but never down to 1:1. Why? Cos most adults cant be bothered with the immaturity of the statistical age group of an alliance player...12yrs old. Now the Horde has to as well. <br />
<br />
I look forward to the opportunity to welcome the more mature player who has had enough of the kids, and is wanting to escape the Alliance in favour of the Horde, but dont pray too hard for paradise....the kids are already over here...with more coming in droves.</div></div><hr />

While I do not deny there are many immature, unskilled alliance players, I personally have had more interaction with them on my horde account.<br />
Also, where are you pulling these server statistics from? I know that my horde server out numbers the Alliance HEAVILY, with allies getting rediculous tenacity buffs in WG every battle.<br />

My point is, as there are 11 million players, you cannot generalise, I would be happy to suggest that there are roughly even numbers of imature players for each faction.<br />
<br />
ITS OK FOLKS, ITS ONLY REASON...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And how exactly is that bad?<br />
Just like rolling a belf lolladin to 80 and then turning faction.<br />
<br />
Some people are just fedup with their faction after playing it for 4/5 years.<br />
And now, insttead of rerolling they can switch sides and keep all there gear/reps/golds and all the stuff they gathered in the past and breathe some new life into this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play a resto/ele shaman, troll, and a survival hunter, draenei, and while there are immature arguments on Alliance, this is what I see on Horde:<br />
<br />
Anal [Skill here]<br />
<br />
Murloc [movie title here]<br />
<br />
Chuck Norris jokes<br />
<br />
And Barrens chat.<br />
<br />
There's also chatspeaking ridiculous scrubs that're usually blood elf lolladins, and /wrist emo kids playing forsaken.<br />
<br />
That's JUST MY SERVER, though. So if there's immature Alliance/Horde on your server, try not to generalize and believe it's on all servers, because the Alliance are far better than Horde maturity-wise on my two servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rep exploiting, to be honest.<br />
<br />
Humans get rep much quicker, so universal faction grinds like Cen Circle, Argent Dawn, the WotLK factions would be easier. <br />
<br />
This is an odd way around BoA items too. Send 'em to your character you're going to faction change, do the change and bam easier levelling on both factions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is the fact you can't have Ally and Horde on a pvp realm, so is this change just going too benefit PvE and RP realms or would they think of some idea too benefit PvP also? Such as having to convert everything over or change can have both on a PvP realm. Be a bit lame for so many people who do play PvP realm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yay for warrior buffs! finally we're getting fucking rage on dodge/parry/block, and its not the shitty 2 rage it used to be! but i currently only have 4/5 in shield spec via deep wounds build, and im sure MANY warriors have this same build that takes points from shield spec in order to acquire DW, might be a problem for some here.<br />
<br />
wtf is the point of tank 2pc bonuses? why are we going to be needing to spam taunt more, especially considering the taunt diminishing returns implemented some time ago? unless you expect tanks to be missing taunts... or being bad at aggro? ugh i personally hate this bonus, because taunt doesn't actually solve any threat problems one may be having, its better overall to just grant a bonus to an essential tank skill so overall TPS sees a buff. (but YAY DEVASTATE GOT BUFFED, FINALLY)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the faction change...<br />
<br />
It should cost a decent sum of real-life money. And it should cost you your equipped gear AND inventory (I suppose you can keep your gold.) Also, it should cost you all of your achievements, and reset your professions to 0 - in short, the only thing you get to keep is your level.<br />

<br />
Simply awesome!!<br />
<br />
I think this change is meant to be for pve servers, but, and I see the point for doing it, perhaps faction changes in pvp servers will move all your characters from one faction to another in a single step. But I hardly imagine how to move all your chars from one faction to the other, choosing new races an so on. In this particular case, perhaps races will be interchanged the way the orb of deception works, automatically.<br />
<br />
Well, I like the idea. But begging your pardon, my particular oppinion is that the game sux with horde/alliance conflict. Who is the evil faction? Who are the good people? I find better idea to create a pvp faction: Free races against forces of evil (right now, both aliance and horde against Arthas army, the burning legion and silithids). The conflit style sould be like the current wintergrasp/archavon idea. PvP zones with interesting farming, raiding, quests and pvp content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's kinda the point of WoW. At times, it does boil down to Horde vs Alliance, but they realise that sometimes there's bigger things that need to be done. Working together with end-game factions (e.g. Argent Dawn/Cenarion Circle, The Sha'tar/Scryer/Aldor, Argent Crusade/Kirin Tor), the conflict is put to one side for the best interests of Azeroth. After all, what use is your conflict if Evil Bad Guy is going to kill both sides? If you defeat him, then you can carry on with the war.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the war's not that a big a part of Warcraft (except PvP). Sure, Varian wants to kick it off, but Thrall's mind is elsewhere. People like Jaina and Rhonin are needed to keep the two sides on the right track.<br />
<br />
What Warcraft excels at is having these two warring factions, but not playing on it much. It uses it when it can, but prefers to focus on the bad guys. The Burning Crusade, the Scourge.. Much bigger threats than the Alliance or Horde, and could eliminate one faction as easily as the other. Neither faction is evil, neither is good. I suppose if you take leaders into it, the Horde are more like the good side. Varian is too obsessed with revenge and mindless slaughter and does come across as evil.<br />
<br />
Don't worry, the conflict is there, it's just on the back burner for now.</div></div><hr />
