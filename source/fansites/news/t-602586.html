2.3 Testing<br />
There are no current plans to give free respecs with the 2.3 patch (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366701493&amp;postId=23664330327&amp;sid=1#66))<br />

The current droprate for &lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/item/29434/&quot;&gt;(Item #29434)&lt;/a&gt; in Karazhan and Zul'aman is 1-2 per boss. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366731869&amp;postId=23664098476&amp;sid=1#1))<br />

Hunters<br />
The min range on ranged attacks will be reduced to eliminate the &quot;dead zone&quot;. It doesn't mean that you'll be able to shot at 0 yards, but you will always be able to hit the enemy even if he's standing between 5 and 8 yards. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366566665&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=15#281))<br />
More hunter changes might be added, a mortal strike effect on aimed shot is still a possibility. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366566665&amp;postId=23663637329&amp;sid=1#8))<br />

Fanaticism will now reduce threat caused by all actions by 6/12/18/24/30%, in addition to its current effect. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366553374&amp;postId=23663518766&amp;sid=1#0))<br />

Meanwhile on PvPScene.com<br />
It's been a long time since an article was posted here, I had to put it on standby for a while but don't worry, it's not closed. <br />
Pitbull - Arena Addons 4 (http://www.pvpscene.com/index.php?topic=696.0). (You can also check Arena Addons #1 (http://www.pvpscene.com/index.php?topic=84.0), #2 (http://www.pvpscene.com/index.php?topic=170.0), and #3 (http://www.pvpscene.com/index.php?topic=366.0) !)<br />

<br />
Also note that we had more server issues today (and since the beginning of the 2.3 PTR), it should be fixed tomorrow, you might experience some random logout if you're a member (actually you're not really logged out, it's just a cache from a guest page). It will let me spend a lot more time to update the 2.3 changes and answer all the mails/PMs I got recently. ^^<br />

Zul'aman preview<br />
Boss strategies on Elitistjerks.com forums (http://elitistjerks.com/f15/t17039-ej_forum_community_zulaman_testing/)<br />
<br />
When you enter the instance, you can start an event by talking to a NPC called &quot;Harisson John&quot;. A 20 minutes countdown will start, the first boss will yell ... guess what ? You've got 20 minutes to kill him. <br />
<br />
Kill order (If you're not doing the event, you don't have to kill them in this order)<br />
1. Nalorakk (Bear god), 2. Akil'zon (Eagle god), 3. Jan'alai (Dragonhawk god), 4. Halazzi (Lynx god), 5. Malacrass (Big warlock troll), 6. Zul'jin (Bad guy)<br />
<br />
Best case<br />
If you kill the boss in time, you will free a prisonner and get an epic loot as a reward. (The prisoner will open a chest or some kind of other container, a bit like Majordomo).<br />
Once the boss is killed, you get 20 more minutes to kill the next one, and 20 more minutes after the 2nd kill, etc ...<br />
<br />
Worst case<br />
If you wipe on a boss, you can't try it again before the end of the timer, it won't respawn.<br />
Also, if you fail the event at some point, you won't get the 20 minutes countdown back after the kill. If you couldn't kill the first boss in time, you won't get any of the &quot;bonus&quot; loot for the following bosses.<br />

100G. I predict that EVERYONE will become an engineer next patch. Its time to light up the suggestions forum and ask for another primary profession slot. Or heck, separate the professions into &quot;Fabrication&quot; profs (Blacksmithing, Engineering, Tailoring, Alchemy, or Jewelcrafting) and &quot;Gathering&quot; profs (Mining, Skinning, Herbalism) then allow two Fab and one Gather.<br />
<br />
This would require Enchanting and Disenchanting to become separate professions or something so that probably wouldn't work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then there's that. But the fact that I can't use the realm transfer without severing my &quot;main&quot; Engineer/Jewelcrafter from his support network of Miner/Skinner and Herbalism/Alchemist (And bank mule) is a bit of a pain. Or that I would have to give up Engineering or Jewelcrafting for Enchanting anything other than BoE stuff is also annoying. I'm just saying is all, you give us 20 extra levels, two new professions (though Inscription seems to be Alt-friendly with the sell-able scrolls) and no new profession slots? I'd appreciate one more.<br />
<br />
Hypothetically, that would rock. As the point of the game is management of scarce resources (Talent points, Inventory space, Gold) and the effort is to make these choices difficult and significant, I'd say not a chance of that happening. However, I wouldn't mind it.<br />
<br />
But I digress. Patch 2.3 looks cool, can't wait to get off work and mess with it!</div></div><hr />

And since parts of it are still buggy, it will probably change before the patch comes out.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I noticed that the Swift Nether Drake from the award of achieving Gladiator title is going through a bit of a change in 2.3. This makes me very happy since I plan on getting one of these mounts myself at the end of this season and was worried I was going to get stuck with a drake that was a color I wasn't too fond of. However, it seems that they now are going to be carrying some sort of flag, and it's not that the drake's skin color changes, but the armor color. Right now all but one of the drakes armor is buggy, but you can see by the basic shape of the model that there is a change.<br />

First boss seemed pretty basic, switched between a 'human' form and a bear form periodically throughout fight. Did a charge with PBAoE knockback while in his 'human form' seemed to hit lightly. In bearform he hit harder and did a bleed attack that seemed to do significant damage and had an AoE shout that silenced.<br />
<br />
We didn't get too much experience with the second boss, but from what I did see, he cast a DD Debuff that increased your nature damage taken by quite alot (he cast it on me twice in a row, the second one did 4.5k with increased damage) and then did an ability called Electric Storm which was an AoE that started at about 800 damage and seemed to go up by another 800 damage each second (yeah massive ouch). We mostly started to wipe at this point, but it looked like he summoned a bunch of non elite birds that flew above the raid and would do a dive bomb attack on the players, unsure what kind of damage they did. <br />

Incredible that literally none of it requires instances or rep. Not a single piece. Heck, you can buy Adamantite frames, Khorium Power cores, Fel Iron Bolts and Felsteel Stabilizers from VENDORS! Also the toolbox and charges aren't Bound at all, so you could craft and mail or buy them at the AH, if you were lazy and didn't want to fight goldfarmers for Fel Iron nodes.<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
<br />
ZA Stuff I'm interested in: The severed head (the best new wand model since the Hail-Satan skeleton hand, or the new version of the Skull-covered-in-snakes healing mace from ZG?), the Omega looking thing on the right (is it an Axe or a Mace?) and the Tonfa/Warglaive on the left (if that is a 1-handed sword I'll be ecstatic).<br />
<br />
Other stuff I'm interested in: What sort of Awesomesauce has been poured on to Gizlock's Hypertech Buckler? I'm running a lowbie Paladin through his Belf paces right now, and plan on taking the Buckler all the way from Mara to the Dark Portal in its current form. How much better will it be with dungeon updates? And what are some quest rewards from Mudsprocket? The aforementioned Belf is 39, but his equipment is lacking. I could shelve him until 2.3 and work on other alts if the new quest rewards are worth it.</div></div><hr />

Yep. It's typically for Blizz, that they won't give us a extremley needed item without any circumstances. For only 24 Slots (a normal BM needs about 30 for a Raid) a Primal Nether, that sucks hard.</div></div><hr />

Also could be because of the timed event; clear the place fast enough and you get 2 epics per boss instead of 1.</div></div><hr />

and here's a little i found out about the decrease of xp needed to lvl:<br />
<br />
<br />
At the live server it's needed 167100 to get to lvl54.<br />
On PTR it's needed 137000 to get to lvl54. That's 18% (18,01) less.<br />
<br />
At the live server it's needed 173900 to get to lvl55.<br />
On PTR it's needed 142500 to get to lvl55. That's also 18% (18,05) less.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, when transfered the character had 143479 / 167100 xp.<br />
On PTR he started with 136999 / 137000. <br />
So you won't level up by having an amount of xp bigger then the new needed one.</div></div><hr />

Prices of items are in the itemcache.wdb, in this case it's a bit more complicated but as long as you've got them in your itemcache, you can find the price at some point.</div></div><hr />
