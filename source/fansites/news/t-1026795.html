Statistics: Class Balance Follow Up<br />
You asked for it, so here is the class balance at each of the different Valor Points achievement levels. Keep in mind that the higher we raise the bar, the smaller and nosier the sample becomes. The data from 50,000 Valor Points is unlikely to provide any statistically useful insight. Let me know if there are other things you would like to see in the future.<br />
<br />
Sample Sizes<br />
<br />
Any: 6,200,000<br />
5k: 1,800,000<br />
25k: 254,000<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
Check back later this week for a list of Black Friday sales! <br />
<br />
If you have been looking to purchase a new hard drive recently, you might have noticed that prices have tripled from what they were just a month or two ago. This is due to the recent floods (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-21/thailand-cuts-2011-growth-forecast-to-1-5-from-4-5-after-record-floods.html) in Thailand, which affected all of the major hard drive manufacturers and their suppliers. It is going to be 6-12 months before prices come back down closer to their previous levels, as some of the factories still have several feet of water inside.<br />
<br />
Now is a good time to buy a SSD, as the next generation is a good while away and the current prices are fairly flat (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/november/ssdgraph.gif). AMD's Bulldozer arrived to universally negative reviews (http://www.anandtech.com/show/4955/the-bulldozer-review-amd-fx8150-tested), citing excessive power usage and heat output and very poor single threaded performance. They are working on another stepping which may help the problem slightly, but don't expect any significantly improvements on the design until the middle of 2012 with the arrival of Piledriver. New AMD GPUs are rumored to be coming in Q1 2012 if you are thinking about upgrading.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

<br />
Shamans have a downwards trend as well in the end.<br />
<br />
I'm shocked to see Hunters being so darn low at 50K though, they drop a lot and yet they are among the best dpsers in the current content, plus they can bring almost any stray buffs missing in the game which makes them really good for 10 mans.<br />
<br />
Personally I believe 10 man guilds are the reason for these trends, Cataclysm has forced a lot of people into 10 mans, which require a lot more dual speccing. And there's just no benefit of being a pure dps class except for loving that class' combat system. I'm a pure dps myself, and if I hadn't loved my class as much I would have switched to a multipurpose class long ago.</div></div><hr />

Of each other. Add each class' percentage for each category and you get 100. So if one class goes up, another class must go down for the next category.</div></div><hr />

They only have 1 armor set to gather.My warlock stopped doing troll dungeons after getting all his valor gear. But all the hybrids in my raidgroup kept collecting gear for their 2nd or even 3rd specs. Naturally they'd have more vp because they were capping for much much longer. For alts this is even more obvious as they usually have less raiding time so the hybrid dungeon crawlers capping vp keep going while the pures pick their noses after their first set.</div></div><hr />

Warlord Zon'ozz and Yor'sahj could have lead the faceless ones in vash'jir, and Warmaster Blackhorn could have been directing the twilight dragonflight in the Twilight Highlands... while I know it would have been a bit of work to include these end-game bosses in this way from the very start of the expansion, Blizzard really needs to work on tying these things together to give the story a much more cohesive, directed feel... with the relatively &quot;unknown&quot; territory they're going in to with MoP, they're going to need to focus on establishing story lines solidly from the start.</div></div><hr />

Did you really just recommend spending $700 more on the new i7 for gaming?? do you just like splashing out on the most expensive things without bothering to check out how well it actually works with gaming? And honestly &quot;entry level&quot; what the hell.<br />

Next why would you want a 600gb ssd? I mean if you just wanted everything running off ssd's then just buy more 120gb ones which works out cheaper anyway.<br />
<br />
Tri-sli ? is a useless piece of technology for gaming, unless you happen to be using a 3 monitor arrangement running your games at 5700x1280. You will get better performance from using just 1 card like the gtx590. This also happens to cost you a lot less money.<br />
<br />
Obviously if you have money to burn then buy the setup you suggested and upgrade it all in 1year when they release the new components. For me the $5000 price difference between your &quot;entry setup&quot; and the Unicorn setup kinda says something about who is more aware of what games can use at the moment and what is worth paying for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unicorn should really be updated for SANDY BRIDGE-E now that it was released November 15th even if the 2600k is a legendary cpu the socket is much better for games like wow having 40x pci lanes so you can actually have 2 graphics cards at the full 16 lane capability. oh and pci-e 3.0 = double bandwidth. quad channel ram....... only thing good about 2600 is a cpu benchmark which it will score high overclocked to hell but we all know wow uses less cpu and more gpu so there's really no point. Turn off hyper threading and see your wow fps jump why? because wow can only use 2 cores weather they are physical or threaded. Meaning wow will use 1 physical core at 50% and one theoretical core at 50% when you turn off hyper threading wow will use 2 physical cores at 100%. Unfortunately that is how wow is programmed atm<br />

The PCIe lanes off the CPU are quite configurable. Users running dual-GPU setups can enjoy the fact that both GPUs will have a full x16 interface to SNB-E (vs x8 in SNB). If you're looking for this to deliver a tangible performance increase, you'll be disappointed:<br />

no, its quite obvious why pures dont have that many valors... they dont need them. they have one set of armor, the end, you can gear up pure class from valors with like 10k easily, you need 3 times as much for say druids or paladins as they have three different sets of gear or warrs and DKs as they have 2 different sets of gear.

<br />
Na the mechanics are a piece of cake - assi or combat - nothing complicated - the point is i think that other classes (esp. hybrid classes) bring more benefits and the same or better DPS to raids. It is common sense that it is better to bring a druide/shaman with equal gear and skills to a raid as an rogue - in my raid we have hybrids with dual talents (druide / shaman as range / melee) so we can switch if we need more melee or if we need more range. <br />
<br />
The gear is nowadays a minor problem (boe, craftables, 2nd need ...) and many raiding hybrids are used to play two styles already (because the content and raids favors/rewards this playstyle) - the trivialized mechanics makes it easy to switch between to talents. Sure all our player play there main style the best but there second talents are also good enough. We switch from 3 healers to 2 healers in some fights or from 2 tanks to 1 tank or be able to switch from melee to range - and that is the point where hybrids do shine over the single dps classes.</div></div><hr />

There, a good entry level gaming rig.<br />
<br />
Calling a 5.3k € machine an &quot;entry level&quot; rig must be the crown of exaggeration. Your machine would be as efficient as a thermonuclear reactor for powering a lawn mower.<br />
<br />
Most of the parts are completely overkill and by the time they become effective newer technology will have taken its place, even if you are an enthusiast gamer you would have to do pretty well to exploits its powers to the fullest which with the most games out today should be a pretty hard thing to do. I own a single card GTX580 myself and I found it probably will last me a long while, it certainly isn't needed if you are indeed an entry level gamer.</div></div><hr />

Don't get me wrong: New models would be nice, but I'd rather see new models on more important and relevant stuff, like if the recent model looks like ass. I am against new models when there is no real reason for something or someone to look particularly distinct. But let's look at them:<br />
<br />
-The two humanoids are just that: humanoids. They wear armor. That's what most humanoids in this game do. They don't need a model of their own.<br />
<br />
-That giant thing? That's Ozruk. And I believe only Ozruk, as all other Deepholm NPCs have a more basic model. I can live with a model not just being a throw-away boss in a 5-man instance.<br />
<br />
-The dragon. Yeah, they could give them a new model, but so far only the Aspects have a model of their own. If nay dragon got one, how would you make the Aspects distinct?<br />
<br />
-The Faceless Ones. They're a race. That's what they look like. And even if they are powerful Faceless Ones, complaining that they look like any others is like complaining Obama looks like a normal human.<br />
<br />
I'd -love- to see new models for a bunch of other things: A good deal of the Beasts and critters in this game look terrible. Cats for instance have corners to poke your eyes out due to low poly-count. They are things you see every day when you go out into the world and they continue to be an eye-sore together with the cardboard trees. They should be over-hauled and the old models gotten rid of. Again, a Wolf is a Wolf and I'd like him to look like one. And give Orcs a straight spine while we're at it... But the Bosses already have decent models. More than decent considering all we'll see from them most of the time is their ankles.</div></div><hr />

I blame the ability to fill all roles (tank/healer/dps) and the classic D&amp;D &quot;Paladin in shining armor is fucking awesome&quot; concepts.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also please note on the graph that I've raided almost every week since the start of Cata and only have 43k Valor. The people with 50k+ are literally a SUPER SUPER small sample size.<br />
<br />
Blizzard wouldn't. <br />
<br />
The only reason the levels are higher for Paladins at the 50,000 VP point is that both they (and their runner-up, druids) can be both endgame tanks and healers. Hence, they get higher representation. This is corroborated by the high presence of Warriors at 50k points.<br />
<br />
Shamans are the exceptions to this because of their lack of desirability by many guilds due to their poor mobility, needed in many hardmode fights in Firelands. It's balancing out now, granted, now that Firelands Hardmodes are nerfed and easier farmed by guilds, but there it is.<br />

First: on models in the raid. The art team did not devote their efforts to the boss models in this particular raid. There are a myriad of things that required some serious art work that cannot be displayed in the boss window... admittedly, many of the obvious examples being in the 1st and 2nd phases of the Deathwing fight.<br />
<br />
Second: No. Rogues have been screwed by the introduction of Death Knights. Death Knights accomplish exactly what Rogues did with a similar but far more engaging/complex resource system, with more survivability (at the time of introduction) and an additional, vital role to fill. Out of all the rogue players that I have known since Vanilla, all but one of them rerolled to Death Knight at WotLK and they've never looked back.<br />
<br />
I'm also a Rogue re-roll, but my switch occurred at Burning Crusade, and before I could justify ponying up for paid character transfers. People's results may vary, but it is not -- as I've seen some people apt to accuse -- BECUZ PALADINS. The playstyle of (Ret) paladins for WotLK was too simplistic to be fulfilling for many Rogues, and their damage advantage petered out at 3.1.</div></div><hr />

Turn off hyper threading and see your wow fps jump why? because wow can only use 2 cores weather they are physical or threaded. Meaning wow will use 1 physical core at 50% and one theoretical core at 50% when you turn off hyper threading wow will use 2 physical cores at 100%. Unfortunately that is how wow is programmed atm<br />
<br />
So what you are saying is, anything more then 2-3 cores for wow is useless. Yet you want to get a 6-core for it......... Plus it not being faster then a 2500/2600 in games atm, its a waste of money for a gaming build. <br />
<br />
As for the builds. Why dont you get the crucial m4 also in the unicorn build??? i dont see why you want to spend 80 bucks more for something that isnt better. Also putting the OCZ drive in there... is (imo) just bad. With all the issues going around. <br />
<br />
As for the intel ssd, the 70 bucks saved, could be used for a better gpu/case/ or something else.</div></div><hr />

It's of my opinion that you should stop letting people who know minor things about computers pick the Narwhal and Unicorn setup's. They are not offering the best parts, and with the amount of casual gamers who read mmo champ, they may be made to believe that they are buying the best on the market. Specifically, I want to call out the PSU that is being recommended. While the Corsair has some good power supplies, they are not Gold or Platinum standard, and are just basic &quot;certified&quot; PSU's. The benefit of buying Gold\Plat PSU's is that eventually, you make up the money over time due to the considerable amount of power saving it does.</div></div><hr />

Something else worth mentioning is that Blizzard is trying to cut the life cycle of the expansions by 6 months, so there isn't as much time to squeeze more bosss in. Also as others have noted, the mechanics of the fights now are far more complex then they were in BC, which requires not only more development time, but more testing time as well. So boring mechanics, or more bosses? Often in life you find that there will be trade-offs, where you have to give a little to get.</div></div><hr />

15(Naxx) and Ony were not new bosses. Felt more like Blizz didn't had money for new bosses and just took already existant. Not much modifications were made in Naxx to consider it new content.</div></div><hr />

The Conclave, Alakir, Alysrazor and Rhyolith encounters are more interesting than a lot of the TBC bosses. Don't know if you've done Ragnaros heroic and Sinestra... but it's far more interesting than most of the TBC end bosses. Nefarian (normal and heroic) is imo about the same as Lady Vashj.

just 50 bosses over 28 bosses, doesnt make the expansion with 50 bosses better...<br />
<br />
in my opinion bosses were never as good designed as nowadays in regards of mechanics.<br />
<br />
back in the days almost every boss was a boss for lets say one role , while the other to could stand there and play one-handed.<br />

Even if a Rogue was lucky with gear drops, after gearing from heroics, and then moving on to raids, they should still easily get a ton of Valor Points. I think the majority of people who have 50k plus vp do so because they are also raiding.<br />

<br />
Well, a few things would be driving the 50k achievement: More gear needed (hybrids), Usefulness/power (leading toons to be in good raid groups clearing raids every week, and roped into running 5mans), quick solo queues (leading players who don't cap via raids to not mind queueing to cap via 5mans), fun/easy gameplay (leading players to not just prefer doing 5mans on alts).<br />
<br />
Now that Ele and Resto gear are the same basically, some players can get away with just using mostly one set to dps and heal...but so can Priests and their percentages rise as VP count rises. Shaman have been pretty weak this expansion (with the exception of PvP Resto), so even a Shaman like myself who has raided pretty consistently the entire xpac might prefer to play another character for 5mans. I know from personal experience that the Mage I raid with is a lot more likely to be running 5mans just for the fun of it, but obviously that's anecdotal and subject to personalities. A pretty decent chunk of those Shaman have likely rerolled one of the more effective classes. <br />
<br />
It's impossible to say because there are different forces driving, and different routes to, getting a lot of valor points. I think you could say that of the healer hybrids, Shaman are the least popular PvE Main this expansion. Mine has been my main, but I'm 'only' at 42k VP; I've been doing a lot of alt-rerolling and gold-making this expansion. <br />
<br />
I'm not surprised to see Lock and Rogue drop off like that, they're not terribly popular classes even though they're quite good when well-played, and they don't have off-specs to gear after the first month of a new tier of gear. The DK graph is surprising though; I'm sure it's partly because of the difficulty of tanking well on them and the general perception of them being spikey and tough to heal as tanks. They pretty much get VP like a pure dps class nowadays.</div></div><hr />

Reused models have been going on for years and some of us have grown use to it. Morchok's skin is fine. I like it a lot. Zon, Yor, and Hagara need a model update from what they are. They need to be slightly unique for a raid like this. Ultra looks okay, but better up close. Blackhorn is good.

IIRC, KJ was Rags skeleton with Eredar skin and Warlock T6 wings added. Also, thanks for reminding me, I forgot Felmyst actually used Sapphiron's skeleton.<br />

It gives for more variety. Thats exaclty what is lacking in Cata. Cata is 1 year old in 2 weeks. How many tiers ? 2 so far with very limited amount of bosses.

I think you're unclear on what &quot;reskinning&quot; is. Using the same skeleton/animations is not reskinning.<br />
<br />
Brutallus is a completely different model than Magtheridon.<br />
Felmyst is not a Netherdrake, but as was pointed out later on, IS a reskin (and a very lazy one at that) of Sapphiron.<br />
Eredar Twins have completely different models than standard draenei, much like Sylvanas has a different model than standard elves.<br />
M'uru is indeed a reskinned Naaru; all Naaru use the same model.<br />
Kil'jaeden is a completely unique model and is not based on Archimonde at all.<br />
<br />
By comparison, every single one of these bosses is a reskin with the exception of Deathwing, who has a unique model that has been in the game since the expansion's launch. There are no new models here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Skeleton - the core of a character. Controls the movement. Creating a complete set of movements for a skeleton is a very time-consuming process.<br />
<br />
Model - the actual 3D mesh of a character. Different models can use the same skeleton (and animations) as long as they have the same basic form and layout. Creating a new model is a somewhat time-consuming process.<br />
<br />
Texture - the &quot;skin.&quot; Controls the color (can also control other things like bumps and highlights) of a character. A model can use any number of skins to look different, but it will not effect the actual geometry in WoW. Creating a new complete texture set for a character is a somewhat time-consuming process. Changing the colors of a texture or &quot;palette swapping&quot; is a process that takes anywhere from a few seconds to ~an hour.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reskinning&quot; is taking a model already in use and giving it a new skin - a new texture - through either palette swapping or the creation of an entirely new texture.</div></div><hr />

With Cata, you'd think they'd at least have quality, if not quantity; but alas, we've seen neither. Bring on MoP I say; if only to forget this expansion ever happened.<br />

Give it some more years and you will pay for DLC that contains a Raid, a Dungeon, some Quests and some minor bs.</div></div><hr />

Morchok's skin is fine. I like it a lot. Zon, Yor, and Hagara need a model update from what they are. They need to be slightly unique for a raid like this. Ultra looks okay, but better up close. Blackhorn is good. Not feeling Deathwing 1.0, but excited to see how everything turns out in 2.0.Yeah, its not the reuse of models per se that annoys me. It's when it looks like the new boss took almost no effort (relatively speaking) to derive from the old model. That, and when the new boss just doesn't look very good, e.g. Morchok.<br />
<br />
I know these bosses are supposed to be monstrous, but that doesn't mean &quot;bad&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It basically says that 1200 people have no life whatsoever (ie, 1200 people have played enough to earn 50K valor points on a character), and that of these 1200, approximately 253 are paladins (21.2% of 1200).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. What in the world would anyone spend 50k valor points on?? I have 23k and ran out of things to spend my VP on a long, long, long time ago. And I'm a druid so 3 specs. The differences between druids/pallies and the other classes is somewhat explained by the fact that those 2 classes can have 3 specs, but even so, there's literally no reason anyone would ever need that many VP.<br />

If it's only for the achievement, damn Blizzard has done a good job of brainwashing sheep into doing completely useless tasks over and over for little or no reward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can look it up. Look at the valor points earned achievement.<br />
It can be found under the 'dungeons and raids' tab. Select the next uncompleted 'Earn &lt;X&gt; valor points' achievement and it'll show.</div></div><hr />

to be fair a lot of the work goes into the mechanics, not the models, that said i find it really weird how long it takes blizz to crank out models of any sort (bosses, mounts etc etc etc)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suppose that the graph mostly says that.... classes that can switch to either tank or heal are the best choices to farm valor points in random dungeons, and therefore to farm the 378 bracers (for selling purpose) or the bag with mounts&amp;pets (so that their main can get the few they still don't have). ;)</div></div><hr />

Intel Core i7-3960X for gaming? The i5 2500K is more than enough for gaming. Hell even the i7 2600K is a tad overkill for gaming, especially MMO's. <br />
