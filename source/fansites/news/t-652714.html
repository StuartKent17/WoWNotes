Strand of the Ancients Coin Toss in Patch 3.2<br />
I have some news that will hopefully alleviate some of your concerns. The current plan is to implement the &quot;coin toss&quot; for Strand of the Ancients in the next major content patch. We know it's been a long time coming, but the solution to the issues preventing us from originally randomizing who starts on offense/defense is in the works right now. <br />

Ulduar Hall of Fame Update<br />
I finally took the time to update the Hall of Fame (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=864) with the latest kills. Please note that it isn't complete yet, the hard mode of Yogg-Saron remains undefeated 2 months after the release of the dungeon. <br />

Blue posts<br />
Rogue Mage Priest<br />
We'd prefer to see other comps as dominant as RMPs in 3s. The problem is if we nerf RMP without making other changes, then double melee teams would likely just take their place. The public perception is that at least RMP requires more coordination and finesse than double melee (though we also think there is validity to the claim that just because you have the option of crowd control doesn't mean that bursting someone down makes you somehow more legit.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17779799571-rmp-is-unstopable.html))<br />
<br />
PvP Issues<br />
I'll be very brief, but here are the problems we see in PvP right now.<br />
<br />
1) Too much emphasis on Arenas and not enough on BGs.<br />
2) Too much emphasis on 2s and not enough on 3s and 5s.<br />
3) Not enough class / spec representation in Arena. Warlock, hunter and shaman numbers in particular are too low, but they're not the only ones.<br />
4) Too fast-paced.<br />
<br />
Let me explain this last one in more detail. Some people in the community think that burst dps is too high. We disagree, and the reason we do is that healing is also very powerful in Arenas, to the point at which not having a Mortal Strike debuff may be a huge liability. If you can't burst someone down when wounded, they just aren't going to die unless the healer is mana-drained or chain crowd-controlled, neither of which are overly fun in the extreme case. You can have too much damage, too much healing or too much crowd control.<br />
<br />
But when you consider specific matches, particularly of the highest rated teams, those guys are using their full toolbox. The problem is that the windows in which to use those tools can be very small. When you are injured, you might have a global cooldown in which to respond. If you make it, you might very well be fully healed in the next cooldown and &quot;reset&quot; the match. If you fail, you're dead and the match may be over. We'd like to add an extra GCD or two to many of these situations.<br />
<br />
Now there still are extreme cases of burst in some specs that need to be chilled out. However, if we just lower burst damage across the board we're concerned people just wouldn't ever die and only specs with multiple forms of crowd-control would be considered viable. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17779590334-what-is-a-problem-in-pvp-right-now.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I probably should have added an additional bullet, which is that in the previous season, starter resilience gear was either too hard to get or sacrificed too many stats. We want resilience to be attractive because of the survivability it brings (and I think that part is working), but we started players too low. You need like 500 before you start to notice its effect and 800 to 1000 before you actually live long enough to respond to attacks (though as I suggested above, perhaps not long enough). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17779590334-what-is-a-problem-in-pvp-right-now.html))<br />
<br />
Burst damage in PvP<br />
Let’s assume for the sake of argument that burst is too high. Imagine we made changes such that getting an 8K crit was almost impossible and 3K or 4K hits were more common. Now consider what would happen. You hit someone. The healer heals them. You keep hitting. The healer heals them. Two strategies then rise to the top as the only way to win a match: keep the healer crowd-controlled forever or drain her mana. Yet not every class has the same amount of crowd control and very few have mana drains. We don’t want every class to have those abilities because then every class feels alike. Furthermore, playing a healer that never gets to, you know, actually play because you’re always sheeped / cyclone or OOM isn’t much fun either.<br />
<br />
In the current game, imagine a mage getting beat on to the point where he is near Execute range. He decides to Blink. If he gets the Blink off, he might have just won the match because he can get healed to full before the melee close again. If he fails to get the Blink off, he’ll probably die in the very next GCD. He might have a window of 2 seconds max to win or lose the game. If you have those situations every now and then you end up with a nail-biter match. That’s cool. However, if every single encounter with the other team is like that, it’s just exhausting. Many fights will end in just a few GCDs. Others will go on and on, at least until the healer runs OOM, which is unlikely to happen with abilities like Innervate and Divine Plea. It’s just too extreme in both damage done and healing done.

<br />
Arenas and grinding for rewards<br />
I think some players like Arenas because they are quick, easy to organize (relative to a BG), often have fast queues, and / or they just enjoy the “purity” (for want of a better word) of just trying to kill the other team without having to worry about flags, reinforcements, bad players not contributing to the war effort, etc. However, a lot of players who may not really like Arenas get drawn into them in order to procure the best PvP gear. This second issue is something we’d like to fix, but we need to develop a way to reward good gear through BGs that isn’t based on endless grinding.

Patch 3.2 Changes<br />
We have some changes in 3.2 that will address some of the concerns healing shamans and paladins have.<br />
<br />
I think the quote some of you are referring to is when I said none of the classes in the game need a complete overhaul. That kind of verbiage tends to come from players who are looking for a completely different class than the one they are actually playing. The kind of changes we're talking about do not involve blowing up the talent trees, core spells or class mechanics and starting over. We almost never do that.

Feral Cat DPS<br />
Kitty dps is probably a little too high. It's tricky though because it is a very demanding spec to play well and if nerf it for the best players, the less-skilled ones might really see their dps plummet.<br />
<br />
I'll say again that we purposely designed Ulduar to have a great diversity among the bosses. Depending on which bosses you look at, the list of whose dps is too low or too high changes. If Ulduar had 3 additional or 5 fewer bosses, the answer would probably be different. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17779490502-discussion-kitty-dps-to-high.html))<br />

Ammo is too expensive<br />
We agree with the comments that ammo costs have gotten too high. It was acceptable when hunters realistically did not die as often, and thus didn't have high repair bills. But it has gotten too high now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17779770654-hunter-questions-and-commentary.html))<br />
<br />
Pet scaling<br />
Pets need to scale better. As soon as you have a hunter choosing say AP over crit because one helps the pet and the other doesn't then that's a problem. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17779770654-hunter-questions-and-commentary.html))<br />
<br />
Traps in PvP<br />
I'm not sure if the healer can out-heal your damage or not. That's a longer discussion about how much damage a healer should have to heal through and if the only healer counter should be CC. But we did design the hunter around having potent CC, and we don't think their CC feels scary any longer. Traps are probably in most need of some attention here. We'll try and go into more detail in the class Q&amp;A if it isn't too far away. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17779770654-hunter-questions-and-commentary.html))<br />

Paladin changes in 3.2<br />
We are working on a (long) post to explain some of the paladin changes. I don't have an ETA. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17779489192-bring-the-healer--not-the-holy-paladin.html))<br />
<br />
[...] Think about it this way. We have a design vision for each class and spec. We readily make changes when the tools or mechanics you have when you aren't meeting that vision. Rarely do we change the vision, though it does happen. The end-game paladin in vanilla WoW was intended to be a healer. We now support an end-game dps or tanking role. The Holy paladin has classically been a tank healer. We're okay though with expanding their breadth a little bit for those situations where you have more paladins than tanks or the raid is taking a lot of damage. However we aren't likely to do that by giving paladins a Wild Growth clone, because that doesn't fit the vision.

Unless you use feralbynight/facemauler at which point the complexity becomes trivial (I appreciate it doesn't give you the exact move to use in every situation but until the last few % of a boss there's really not that much thought required) and as I've seen, cats in hybrid spec and tank enchants can beat full time pure dps.<br />

Don't play dumb. Two players with equal skill will always have almost same DPS. I used to raid as a hunter, as a rogue and as a mage. Not even nearly as hard as playing a cat. I repeat, every single person who QQ about &quot;too high cat dps&quot; must roll a cat and try to deal some &quot;awesum damage&quot;.<br />
Show me AT LEAST ONE PERSON who rerolled a cat AND tops DPS charts. Every single top-damage-cat is a MAIN CHAR, which every single owner played for at least few months.</div></div><hr />

If that skilled rogue QQ alot about nerfing cats then yes. Two almost similar classes, he will be just fine. And if he won't, he will never ever dare to say &quot;nerf cats&quot;<br />

Actually, what I'm trying to explain is that if a cat outDPSes you by far, then you're not geared enough/skilled enough/concentraded enough/optimized enough. I am being outdamaged by a rogue in my guild and our gear is almost equal. Others are just less skilled so they deal less dps.<br />

<br />
That's what we've been suggesting (http://flyv.typepad.com/warcraft/2009/02/kitty-the-most-complicated-dps-rotation-in-the-game.html) for quite some time now, cat rotation brings back &quot;skill&quot; to DPSing, and should be adapted for other classes, too (paragraph &quot;Why complication is good&quot;)<br />
Of course, we can't expect major class changes like that before 4.0</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems as though there's a flaw in the design where positions were switched with Pure DPS and Feral. All Pure DPS need attack rotations that matches the complexity of Feral so it doesn't seem like your meant to do 5% above hybrids just because you're labeled as a Pure.<br />
<br />
Personally I feel that Feral Kitties should be left alone. If a Feral decides to heal mid-fight then his DPS is going to be average at best. Only time I'll agree with Feral DPS being nerfed is if Blizzard puts a little more thought into the attack design of Pure DPS so if done correctly, you'll earn that 5% above the DPS of hybrids and not a 'right' to do 5% more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we also needs to be behind our target wich will turn out in even more problems, like on freya whenyou have to stand under a fungus or @ kologarn he has not a back at all.<br />
<br />
and to be honest i cant think of any other class that need so much strict rules to be able to make some good damage.<br />
<br />
*stay behind the target all the time, els no combopoints for you<br />
*keep 4-5point savage roar upp all the time<br />
*keep 5point rip upp all the time<br />
* keep mangle out mangle out 12 sec<br />
*keep rake out 9 sec<br />
and try to get this going with an energypol of 100<br />
<br />
shred 42 energy 1-2combopoints (depends on crit or not)<br />
rake 35 energy 1-2 combo points (depends on crit or not)<br />
mangle 40 energy 1-2 combopoints (depends on crit or not)<br />
rip 30 energy finishing move glyphed for 4 sec longer duration. (total 20 sec)<br />
savage roar 25energy finishing move 5 points 34 sec duration.<br />
tigers fury mercy spell so its even possible to have your spells upp and rolling 30sec CD<br />
<br />
<br />
adds? yeah sure cant do very much there unless they have 600-700k hp plus without gimping my dps totaly.<br />
<br />
dont ever never drop any of your abilities since your dps start dropping instantl<br />
<br />
pure or hybrid. my point of wiew<br />
hybrid classes what it seems like we had a loooong discussion in our guild other day about this, why would'nt a hybrid class be able to make just as good dps as a pure class? &quot;well its a pure class he cant chose if he want to heal or not&quot;. well if i want to play melee dps, i dont want to be forced into a tree because the pure classes is better. just because it is POSSIBLE for my to play a healer does not say i want to play a healer, im playing feral because i want to, but because your class can heal or tank aswell your dps should be worse then mine because i cant tank or heal...<br />

<br />
I've seen feral cats doing 6k dps, which is obviously high, but on the same fight, rogues were doing 5.5k, I was doing 5k (cat outgears me a lot), others were around the 5-5.5k mark. Having said that, what did I do to hit 5k? I used 3 buttons. What did the cat do? Well, see the above post. <br />
<br />
Just for the love of god, don't nerf kitty dps into a 3 button mashing spec as you already did with virtually all other classes. It's the only dps class/spec left with some skill to play. <br />
<br />
BTW I play fb/ttw mage. <br />
<br />
Oh, and for people that think it's easy to hit those 6k dps figures...I saw a feral cat with 7.5 epix and 8.5 legs, and he did 1400 dps. He had no brains and all he did was mangle spam, no rake, no rip, no savage roar. yes he was probably an ebayer, or just a retard, but if it was that easy, he'd be doing 5k too.</div></div><hr />

Actually, my main spec is elemental as well, and i pull off some pretty decent dps compared to the locks rogues in my guild (5.9-6.1k on most ulduar fights), not that i beat them though but its standard since they're pure dps'ers, am not.<br />

Rather then buff all pure dps classes again, the easiest solution is to nerf feral dps (slightly). So expect a nerf, except it and move on. If you want to do the best dps in the game reroll a pure dps class and abandon the option to heal/tank and dps.</div></div><hr />

The key to getting loot from a boss is actually killing him, not winning DPS meters. Sure, good DPS shortens the time from pull to loot, helps avoiding enrages and oom healers. But actually, you're just playing a game with people that are probably your friends. If you don't get taken on raids anymore because a certain player did 0.2K DPS more than you (while you still did pretty good DPS) then you should look for a new guild.<br />
Nerfing ferals wouldn't help your guild, it would only help you topping the meters, while you're not actually doing more damage.<br />
<br />
GC acknowledged that there is a problem, but plain nerfing ferals would affect every guild that has them negatively, from ensidia to a fresh guild which has a Feral OTing half of the fights, and shredding the other half.</div></div><hr />

Warlocks rogues and mages are pure dps classes, hence they're MEANT to be topping meters? and if a shaman is topping the meters in your guild, you need some guild tweaks.<br />

I think blizzard has the right philosophy of &quot;assuming equal gear+skill a warlock/rogue/mage/hunter should be at the top of MOST dps meters&quot;. There will be fights where other classes do better, but in the majority of cases those 4 should be above everyone else. Not miles, but still a gap.<br />
If hybrids are ever equal to pures in terms of dps then there is no reason to bring the pures besides their buffs (which have been harmonized anyway). The only buffs provided solely by pure dps classes are:<br />
- Intelligence: Arcane Intellect [Mage] / Fel Intelligence [Warlock, Felhunter]<br />
- Mana Regen (Pet): Enduring Winter [Mage, Frost]<br />
- Casting Speed Slow: Curse of Tongues [Warlock] / Lava Breath [Hunter, Pet] / Mind-numbing Poison [Rogue] / Slow [Mage]<br />
- Spell Crit Chance: Improved Scorch / Winter's Chill [Mage] / Improved Shadowbolt [Warlock]<br />
<br />
Of those only Intelligence and Spell Crit Chance are important in the majority of encounters.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer:<br />
- Druid: Feral, Tanked Karazhan<br />
- Warlock: DPSed up to and including BT<br />
- Death Knight: Tanked everything in T7.5 and most of Ulduar. Cleared Ulduar as DPS.</div></div><hr />

Feral Druids clearly OP, as demonstrated by their average DPS for top 50 players:<br />
Yogg - 8th<br />
Vez - 5th<br />
Freya - 4th<br />
Thorim - 4th<br />
Hodir - 5th<br />
Mim - 6th<br />
Aur - 7th<br />
Kol - 10th<br />
Assembly - 5th<br />
Ignis - 5th<br />
XT - 2nd<br />
Razor - 3rd<br />
<br />
Averaging those out, Ferals are 5.3 out of 10 in the pecking order for DPS. Broadly speaking, skilled players of pure DPS classes are ahead of Feral Druids on nearly every boss in Ulduar (including Hard Modes) other than the first 2. Either the people bitching a) have only seen the first 2 bosses (one of whom favours Feral's playstyle more than any other class) or b) suck at playing their class. Or maybe a combination of both. Odintdk, maybe you just need to L2Play?</div></div><hr />

Add skill then there is about 80% less ret paladins killing everyone and 80% less QQ. Aka no more nerfs.<br />

We'd prefer to see other comps as dominant as RMPs in 3s. The problem is if we nerf RMP without making other changes, then double melee teams would likely just take their place. The public perception is that at least RMP requires more coordination and finesse than double melee (though we also think there is validity to the claim that just because you have the option of crowd control doesn't mean that bursting someone down makes you somehow more legit.)

We are working on a (long) post to explain some of the paladin changes. I don't have an ETA. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17779489192-bring-the-healer--not-the-holy-paladin.html))<br />
<br />
[...] Think about it this way. We have a design vision for each class and spec. We readily make changes when the tools or mechanics you have when you aren't meeting that vision. Rarely do we change the vision, though it does happen. The end-game paladin in vanilla WoW was intended to be a healer. We now support an end-game dps or tanking role. The Holy paladin has classically been a tank healer. We're okay though with expanding their breadth a little bit for those situations where you have more paladins than tanks or the raid is taking a lot of damage. However we aren't likely to do that by giving paladins a Wild Growth clone, because that doesn't fit the vision.

That's so freaking clearly show Blizzard's position about different classes! * <br />
<br />
- *Some bunch of nuubs somewhere is the forum QQ about vindication? *- *No problems, here is your hotfix!<br />
- *19 of 20 top teams in 3x3 are RMP? *- We would like to to see other comps as dominant.... bla bla, but we enjoy dominating arena with our favorite rogues, so we will &quot;think&quot; about it<br />
- *More and more paladins are annoyed by continuous nerfing and *neglecting the class - we are working in *post* (nop hotfix. *not changes. freaking post) and don't have ETA (for the freaking post)<br />
<br />
Fuck you, Blizzard, your so called balance, your &quot;communication&quot;, your &quot;we think about all classes&quot;. *Bunch of freaking rogue-playing liers! *Gief the rogue nerf in hotfix (it's melee, so &quot;double melee&quot; won't be so happy about it) NOW and tell us what are you going to do with paladins, which always were the piece of shit as a class and after very short perod of shining are piece of shit again - and after that you could pretend to be anything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play a shadowpriest, so i'm hybrid with a dps rotation to keep up, yet i can outdps most people i get to play with? Does that mean SP needs a nerf too because &quot;pure&quot; DPS QQ that 3 buttons mashing dps should be higher? I don't think so.<br />
<br />
Kitty is just a little too high on some encounters, compared to a similarily geared/skilled raid, so a little nerf might come, but a big nerf would just kill the class i think : why bother playing a class/spec that needs skill to get really less dps than peoples who just faceroll while watching TV?<br />
<br />
The 5% dps difference is more of an arbitrary limit, some hybrids while be under it, some over it. But you can't just say &quot;feral cats are above pure dps so neeeerf them&quot;<br />

PvP wise, the nerf is more justified since pvp ferals have a really huge burst, but if they nerf it to the ground because of PvP, well, that'll be another failure.<br />
<br />
I'm a PvE player who hates PvP, so i don't really get it that people bother about the other guys dps. You want to beat down boss, hard modes, etc... so you need people with skill, regardless of the spec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, kitty nerf, yes but not that much i hope.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean seriously, did you actually expect to keep topping the meters by such high range? and as a hypered class? yes, a hypered class isn't meant to top meters, atleast thats what Blizzard stated, and feral are not even topping meters now, but they're doing it by a big chunk as well, clearly a joke if that wasn't gonna get changed, and dont even bring the &quot;skills&quot; argument here, you can't possibly justify something being overpowered, just cause it requires some &quot;skills&quot; to pull it off, in this case its roughly just more time playing ferals, getting used to their dps rotation and whatnot, while other classes, &quot;pure&quot; ones as well don't even have the choice.<br />
<br />
Seriously, druids in general shouldn't be qq'ing at all, you're probably THE MOST overspoiled class in the history of WoW yet, all 4 specs in one class? 4 which are besting or near besting their other competitor at that? (Resto druid anyone?), free get out of almost all CC's click ? instant heals/hots (and Innervate) as any of the 4 specs, and a guaranteed raid spot just cause of your available variety and CR+Innervate, the list goes on of how much a spoiled class druids are, yet you still want more crazy stuff like topping the dps meters, beating those pure dps classes like np, by that logic everyone would just roll a druid, cause whats the point of trying anything else anyways if druids are going to top them all?<br />
<br />
Seriously, get a clue about this game, and be thankful you're not a Shaman (like me), lock or a hunter class.<br />

<br />
<br />
About the only fight that Cat Druids will always excel on is XT, since it's a static boss which means Cats can concentrate on keeping all their buffs/debuffs up, and time cool downs for heart phases. XT is then followed swiftly by Kologarn who cannot be attacked from behind, hence nuking Cat DPS into oblivion. In an ideal world players would look at Cat DPS and go, &quot;ok, those two balance each other out, so Cat DPS is fine&quot;, but they don't, they go &quot;OMGWTF! Cat DPS higher than mine on XT, Cats OP WTF NERF NERF!&quot; and conveniently forget about that objection when they look at the Recount figures from Kologarn. <br />
<br />
I posted the numbers in a previous post- the average DPS placement of the top 50 parses on WMO for Cat Druids sits at 5.3/10. And that's of the TOP 50 Druids, i.e. those Druids who have the skill to keep up an incredibly demanding rotation, and they're still not facerolling the meters as some people seem to think. How do you think Cat Druids are doing lower down amongst players of average skill who aren't as good at juggling half a dozen buffs and debuffs? <br />
<br />
Honestly, this call for nerfing Feral DPS is all caused entirely by the fact that people looked at the Ensidia vids and saw Tun topping the DPS meters so they immediately think Cats are OP (despite evidence to the contrary) rather than, I dunno, concluding that Tun is a phenomenal player...</div></div><hr />

I begin to wonder if they will start giving a separate currency for BG victories as opposed to losses... i.e. 1 mark of honor for a loss, 1 &quot;spoils of battle&quot; or whatever for a win... and making different gearsets for the differing currencies.<br />
<br />
This doesn't solve the problem of the grindiness of BGs... and it is a problem. On Arenajunkies, common advice for getting an alt arena competitive is to AFK bot BGs. <br />
<br />
I think what I would do is jack up the honor rewards for objective completion - flags and flag assistance in WSG, inner walls blown up in SOTA, flags yanked in AB (maybe only once per node per game to prevent flag swapping), etc... this would encourage actual participation and the greater rewards would make the process less grindy.<br />
<br />
The major problem is that arena is an easy way of saying &quot;this player is good&quot; - hell, the ratings do exactly that. Battlegrounds have no reliable way of doing this. I could win 50 games without ever touching the flag, and I could lose the same amount of games while hitting objectives as hard as I can.<br />

In a nutshell, you cannot learn anything with this rankings. If there is a way to filter it to exclude the healers, the tanks and balance druids, then maybe. And you'll see how outrageous the DPS of kitty is. The nerf is coming.</div></div><hr />

You're all angry cause a feral druid told you to L2P because he played better than you.<br />

Just because some feral get a higher dps than average pure dps doesn't mean they all do, and it also doesn't mean that it isn't their skill speaking rather than their spec.<br />

If you started playing this game not after WOTLK, but in vanilla, as some of the people here, you would know how ridiculous your &quot;especially repals&quot; is.

It's worth pointing out that Druids were &quot;LOLlearntoheal&quot; like Pallies in Vanilla, and &quot;LOLlearntohealortank&quot; in TBC, so we have a lot in common... Not me per say, I've been resto since Molten Core, but I feel a solidarity with Ferals who've had all of 6 months out of the last 5 years to actually play the game the way they want to play it- as DPS. Since then they've had nothing but bitching and moaning from other classes who suddenly have to actually demonstrate some form of competency to guarantee their raid spot, rather than just having chosen a class 5 years ago that can 3-button their way to the top of the DPS meters...</div></div><hr />

So yes, we're in wotlk, and when paladin QQ in wotlk, its funny, because 2 classes shouldn't ever QQ atm, and it's Retpals and DK. Those 2 don't need skill to get a decent dps, and i know that for a fact since i have them in store.</div></div><hr />

Except they wont. They'll dumb down the rotation some, nerf it's output some, then give ferals another Savage Defense type warrior-rip off ability that doesn't even work as well as the warrior version.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm inclined to agree with you. As much as I'm a Blizzard fanboi, they usually do take the easy way out on these things, and they've already acknowledged that Feral DPS would be difficult to balance out given that the complexity of the rotation necessarily entails that good Ferals will do excellent DPS and average Ferals will do Average to Poor DPS. Simply nerfing DPS output would, as they have acknowledged, destroy Average Ferals, and cause huge problems on movement fights even for Good Ferals. More likely is a simplification of playstyle which would even out the Goods and the Bads and bring it down to a pure numbers game, from which point assessing the relative DPS output of Ferals would be a lot easier.<br />
<br />
I suspect we'll get a simplified set of skills for 3.3 (possibly even some time after 3.2) and a rebalance of abilities accordingly. What they should not do however is just reduce Shred damage by x or some equally vacuous nerf that clueless people on these boards are calling for. At current gear levels good Ferals are competitive but not OP, however I will agree that as gear scales towards Icecrown I think good Ferals will start to pull ahead of other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Averaging those out, Ferals are 5.3 out of 10 in the pecking order for DPS. Broadly speaking, skilled players of pure DPS classes are ahead of Feral Druids on nearly every boss in Ulduar (including Hard Modes) other than the first 2. Either the people bitching a) have only seen the first 2 bosses (one of whom favours Feral's playstyle more than any other class) or b) suck at playing their class. Or maybe a combination of both. Odintdk, maybe you just need to L2Play?<br />

Look at every single boss fights. There isn't a single FERAL druid as #1. As other pure dps classes are getting geared they are scaling much better and taking #1,2,3 ect.

Ret paladins were &quot;soooooo buffed&quot;, i.e. overbuffed in the beginning of WOTLK. I wish they never be that overbuffed. Then they were nerfed, and that was expected and good. Then they were nerfed again. And again. And again. Then there was &quot;we nerf judgement, but we buff exorcism&quot; followed by removing exorcism from PVP. Then HoF nerf. Then Vindicaiton nerf. If one class is nerfed every other week, even after there are much more overpowered classes, you would expect QQ. <br />
<br />
Ret palas did't QQ before WOTLK, because there were very few people playing ret pala. <br />

very true, feral raiding is harder than any other class for sure in WotLK. You dont wait for a buff to spam a new button, you dont have a rotation to follow. But you must keep track of your bleeds + mangle (if ur mangle bitch), your personal buffs, and trying to get your bleeds when you have trinkets/extra buffs popped for more damage on your bleeds.<br />

<br />
As far as warlocks, shamans and hunters go, these three are sweet targets to meet in arenas. We would be wrong to say many other classes can live much longer, but these three be killed within a single CC on their healer, or simply by focusing them down. Warlock's pets are extremly fragile, and without one, warlock is in deep trouble. Hunters who do have some &quot;oops I'm in trouble&quot; skills, still go down pretty fast. And shamans are not in a better situation either. All 3 Three can be verry dangerous if left alone, but unfortunately, these three are favourite targets when it comes to focusing and killing them fast. <br />
Something needs to be done to boost their survivability a little, but passive, not yet ANOTHER skill to hunter's list of already too many skills he needs to use chained or in combinations. Something that would maybe make them a little less of a &quot;look it's a shaman /or hunter /or warlock&quot;, nuke him down fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
we did design the hunter around having potent CC, and we don't think their CC feels scary any longer. Traps are probably in most need of some attention here. We'll try and go into more detail in the class Q&amp;A if it isn't too far away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunter's most strongest weapon is his mobility. Without range he simply is rendered useless. Although in a MUCH better situation than back in TBC, hunters need their traps to maintain the pace. Traps will not trigger now, if a target that can not be affected by their effect walks over them. And seeing as it is not a &quot;targeted CC&quot;, like polymorph or blind is, this can cause ALOT of trouble to hunters. Being one of the harder CC in this game to menage effectivly in fast paced arenas.</div></div><hr />

Cats have already very hard time killing healers, outside of very limited spec combos. In fact Feral is one of the hardest spec to play in Arena successfully! Nerfing it for the sake of PvE balance is just plain stupid! <br />
<br />
There are very, very few Ferals in Arena even in 2v2, as most druids play Resto anyway to &quot;faceroll&quot; to high Arena rating.</div></div><hr />

I know that before they were really bad, but now, they are really good. And i find it that since WotlK there is more and more paladin QQ, while they got soooo buffed...<br />
<br />
So yes, we're in wotlk, and when paladin QQ in wotlk, its funny, because 2 classes shouldn't ever QQ atm, and it's Retpals and DK. Those 2 don't need skill to get a decent dps, and i know that for a fact since i have them in store.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're very wrong here. DK have to work hard to dps correctly (i'd say more so than any other class). Blood DKs have to follow a very strict rotation which if you get wrong, your dps tanks a few k. We've recruited a few of these high rated pvp DKs, but they cant touch our full time pve DK (we've had a 2500 rated DK that couldn't dps above the tanks dps).</div></div><hr />

Feral Cat DPS<br />
Kitty dps is probably a little too high. It's tricky though because it is a very demanding spec to play well and if nerf it for the best players, the less-skilled ones might really see their dps plummet.<br />
<br />
I'll say again that we purposely designed Ulduar to have a great diversity among the bosses. Depending on which bosses you look at, the list of whose dps is too low or too high changes. If Ulduar had 3 additional or 5 fewer bosses, the answer would probably be different. (Source)<br />
<br />
my main spec is feral kitty and for people to bitch that our dps is to high is pretty f**kin stupid and they obviously don't know what it takes to play feral kitty. unlike rogues, warriors, dk's, paladins we have more abilities to monitor and cooldowns to keep up not to mention we are still a positional class. if we get stuck infront of a boss unable to shred and can only mangle spam then our dps goes to shit. if you fuck up your rotation by even a few missed button clicks your dps goes to shit. i may at times get lucky and pull top dps but 95% of the time i'm always competing with other pure dps classes for the top 5 spots. just because you don't know how to play your class doesn't mean we are op.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, something would be wrong with that, if it ever fucking happened. Numerous people have posted numerous DPS parses from top guilds doing Heroic Ulduar bosses and Hard Mode bosses that show even the best Ferals only mid-table DPS compared to pure classes, but no no, apparently Ferals are OP and do 1-1.5K DPS more than similarly geared and skilled players because Cavalla said so.<br />

Seriously, pull your head out your ass and realise that just because the Feral Druid in your guild is better than you and you suck at playing your class does not make that true for all players.

<br />
I mean seriously, did you actually expect to keep topping the meters by such high range? and as a hypered class? yes, a hypered class isn't meant to top meters, atleast thats what Blizzard stated, and feral are not even topping meters now, but they're doing it by a big chunk as well, clearly a joke if that wasn't gonna get changed, and dont even bring the &quot;skills&quot; argument here, you can't possibly justify something being overpowered, just cause it requires some &quot;skills&quot; to pull it off, in this case its roughly just more time playing ferals, getting used to their dps rotation and whatnot, while other classes, &quot;pure&quot; ones as well don't even have the choice.<br />
<br />
Seriously, druids in general shouldn't be qq'ing at all, you're probably THE MOST overspoiled class in the history of WoW yet, all 4 specs in one class? 4 which are besting or near besting their other competitor at that? (Resto druid anyone?), free get out of almost all CC's click ? instant heals/hots (and Innervate) as any of the 4 specs, and a guaranteed raid spot just cause of your available variety and CR+Innervate, the list goes on of how much a spoiled class druids are, yet you still want more crazy stuff like topping the dps meters, beating those pure dps classes like np, by that logic everyone would just roll a druid, cause whats the point of trying anything else anyways if druids are going to top them all?<br />
<br />
Seriously, get a clue about this game, and be thankful you're not a Shaman (like me), lock or a hunter class.<br />

That's so freaking clearly show Blizzard's position about different classes! <br />
<br />
- Some bunch of nuubs somewhere is the forum QQ about vindication? - No problems, here is your hotfix!<br />
- 19 of 20 top teams in 3x3 are RMP? - We would like to to see other comps as dominant.... bla bla, but we enjoy dominating arena with our favorite rogues, so we will &quot;think&quot; about it<br />
- More and more paladins are annoyed by continuous nerfing and neglecting the class - we are working in *post* (nop hotfix. not changes. freaking post) and don't have ETA (for the freaking post)<br />
<br />
Fuck you, Blizzard, your so called balance, your &quot;communication&quot;, your &quot;we think about all classes&quot;. Bunch of freaking rogue-playing liers! Gief the rogue nerf in hotfix (it's melee, so &quot;double melee&quot; won't be so happy about it) NOW and tell us what are you going to do with paladins, which always were the piece of shit as a class and after very short perod of shining are piece of shit again - and after that you could pretend to be anything else.<br />

Awesome, just what I was thinking. Why do people from mediocre guilds compare themselves to the feral in their guild, on a fight where they got beat? There's a whole, wide world out there! Think bigger than just your guild. Period. <br />

That depends... If it is goes to RPM dominating arena, we got the &quot;The public perception is that at least RMP requires more coordination and finesse than double melee&quot; BS, i.e. &quot;harder rotation&quot; justify dominating combo being untouched.</div></div><hr />

As the last 6 pages should have shown you there are some people who aren't playing for fun and would rather complain about the game's faults. Granted the game isn't perfect, but in a few years this psuedo sense of entitlement will seem rather silly in the end, the blame falling where it should as opposed to where it's going to go.<br />
<br />
Now to contradict myself. Anyone who says something along the lines of [iInstead of moaning how you deserve the DPS because it's difficult, you should shut up an be glad your class is fun to play[/i] probably doesn't quite know what it is to struggle for dps in this game for some classes. TBC Ret and Prot paladins would probably take the most offense to this since they had to &quot;work for their numbers&quot;, as well as quite a few classes pre-bc (I think Shaman?). Saying something is &quot;fun&quot; even though it's not tuned correctly just isn't right.<br />

Oh of course, I was basing my contention on the average DPS from the Top 50 DPSers in a given week, by class, as a comparison which is clearly not the way to go. What I should obviously have done is base my assessment on one fight, by one guild, where one Druid was top of the DPS, since single samples are clearly far more statistically significant than a wide sample population. /sarcasm. <br />
<br />
But at least you've confirmed my suggestion earlier in this thread that all the QQ about Feral Druids stems from one Mimiron Hard Mode video and the fact that Tun (who is an awesome player) was on top. Try looking at the bigger picture- I know that's a near impossibility for the pea-brained amongst the WOW community, but give it a go.<br />
<br />
Oh, and here's the Feral Druid repetitive pattern by the way- it's obviously just pressing the same buttons in the same order, right?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skiball</div><div class="date">2009-06-16, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like how the classes are different. I like how the holy paladin has holy shock and can easy hget instant flash heals. It is fun being the &quot;instant heal&quot; healer. However, the lack of dots is a huge problem because if ever have to cast a heal, the player it usually back to full health from dots before the cast goes off, even with the 15% haste from from judging.<br />
<br />
However to remedy this I offer a possible solution. Sheath of light is a leet talent, but the dot effect is wasted in the ret tree. SImply switch that dot effect to holy guidance. Is has been dumb to being with that prot and ret got healing buffs where as holy did not. <br />
<br />
I think making the dot effect from sheath of light a function of holy guidance would help without disrupting the &quot;vision&quot; mentioned in the bloue post of the paladin style. <br />
<br />
Also a ret suggestion: To bring Ret back competitve on the meters in pve without making more bust pvp problems, make it so that holy veangence from seal of vengeance can be refreshed by crusader strike, much like how old judgements used to be, and much like how a mage stacks scorch to up their damage. The ticking effect from holy vengeance isn't massive but it may bring ret up slightly to be more competitive without being an OP addition to burst in PVP. In addition, putting points into Seals of the Pure would be nice instead of having 10-15 wasted extra points in pve ret spec you have no idea what to do with.</div></div><hr />

Sorry. It really is just the same thing over and over. Sure, due to crits or lack of crits it might take you longer to build CPs but it doesn't change the fact that it is a pattern.<br />
<br />
Ex: (Disclaimer: I do not play an end-game feral)<br />
<br />
Fight... START!<br />
<br />
Rake: 1/2 CPs<br />
Mangle: 1/2 CPs<br />
(mangle till 4 CPs)<br />
Savage<br />
Rake (if rake is up) Mangle: 1/2 CPs<br />
Mangle (if rake is down) Rake: 1/2 CPs<br />
(mangle till 5 CPs)<br />
Rip<br />
<br />
<br />
All you do is manage CPs. If you have enough CPs you finisher-move. Don't pretend that it is some god-awfully intricate ever-changing edge-of-your-seat PvE fighting style. That doesn't exist in this game. You rake/mangle as needed to savage/rip. Sure, you have a bit more RNG than most other classes... but in the end it is just another &quot;rotation&quot; that perhaps you have to pay a BIT more attention to than a retpaladin who has a /castrandom macro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You've pretty much comprehensively demonstrated your total lack of understanding of the Feral playstyle and thus invalidated any criticisms you might have. Feral is not about managing Combo Points, it's about managing buffs/debuffs. It's about trying to judge whether you have enough time to refresh one buff/debuff without another one falling off, while trying to fit in Ferocious Bites when you can.<br />
<br />
1) Faerie Fire<br />
2) Mangle (or Trauma if you have someone else functioning as Manglebot)<br />
3) Rake<br />
4) Savage Roar<br />
5) Rip<br />
6) Tiger's Fury whenever it's off CD<br />
<br />
If you don't have 1-5 up all the time your DPS plummets. If you don't use Tiger's Fury whenever it's up your DPS plummets. If it was as easy as you made out (lol- where is Shred in this epic 'mangle mangle mangle' rotation of yours, you know, the main Feral offensive attack which incidentally needs to be cast from behind the boss, making all this even more complex in movement fights) Feral would be a breeze, but it's patently not. Your belief that it's as easy as every other class is due only to your ignorance- even Blizzard posters have said it's the most demanding spec to excel at in game. Try levelling a Feral Druid and give it a go, seriously. (and I'm not a raiding Feral Druid either, I'm resto)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dear god, Feral Druids would love a version of Cut to the Chase that refreshes Savage Roar (their version of Slice 'n Dice which has to be repeatedly re-cast as a discreet finishing move rather than just be refreshed off another damaging finisher). If you didn't have it, and if you needed to actually cast something other than your normal attacks to poison a target (like Rake and Mangle which both need to be applied on a one-off basis and monitored to make sure they stay up), the Mutilate rotation might be somewhere approaching the same difficulty. But it isn't.</div></div><hr />

Usually when you make a flowchart it means you...nevermind.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, this is not BC, so I stand by what I said. I raided as a Moonkin in BC, I know how frustrating DPS can be.<br />

While true, you seem to not understand or have learned that it stings to be compared to other classes who are &quot;more then capable of doing the same thing with less/more complexity/utility&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I didn't claim that mutilate was harder then kitty. I've never played a feral in a raid environment, so I can't compare them. I just said that a mutilate flowchart (including energy pooling and timing envenom after poison ticks) would be just as huge as the kitty chart, and that the size of a chart doesn't tell too much about the difficulty of a rotation.<br />
<br />
@ Cocoa<br />
It's more then that, but I'm sure you can look it up at EJ.</div></div><hr />

LOL POOR FERAL DRUIDS. IF THEY DON'T USE THEIR OPTIMAL DPS ROTATION THEY DON'T DO THEIR OPTIMAL DPS.<br />
<br />
qq more. PVE isn't hard. Especially DPS.</div></div><hr />

I loled at this extensive flowchart that can be simplified to a simple priority rotation like almost any other class. Yes you guys are &quot;special&quot;, but not in the way you think you are.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guilded</div><div class="date">2009-06-16, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it frustrating that Prot PvP gear doesn't exist, at least for Paladins. There is so much emphasis on burst or healing and survivability, yet they don't ever encompass ideas about Tank builds. I run with a Tank build, using Raid gear, and surprisingly it works better than I'm sure Blizzard would like it to, especially considering they want to make it so PvP gear is the dominant gear in PvP, as opposed to last season when PvE gear had such dominance. If this is the case, why not make a set for Prot's to use?</div></div><hr />

Wake up fools. In the world's top parses ferals are lucky to be in the middle of the pack. If youre bad that doesnt mean anything. Tun is not the brightest player btw, but unless i see alganon myself i wont take that fight into account. There could be a lot of factors involved, including pure luck or jobs assignment, or any other gimmicks (XT anyone?). <br />
<br />
Morons, the blue did not say a nerf even a slight one is coming, he said they WONT BE NERFING feral because of a few really good players topping the chart because after that the VAST MAJORITY of mediocre players will FALL BELOW VIABILITY. Got it now? Oh i bet there will be a lot of posts following this one repeating the same stupid crap all over again because people can't read :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
You manage buffs and debuffs while juggling two entirely different but inter-related resources (CP + Energy) to do so.<br />
I would say it's comparable to BC Mutilate which required you to make constant decisions as to whether you were going to spend high energy on damage or low energy for CPs so that you could keep Find Weakness rolling. Neither spec was throttled strictly by CPs or energy, they were throttled by your ability to strike a balance between dps and buff management.</div></div><hr />
