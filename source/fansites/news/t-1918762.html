Legion - Artifact Weapon Previews<br />
Today we are going back to finish up some more of the Artifact weapon previews, starting with Blood Death Knight and Marksmanship Hunter. The Hunter weapon goes nicely with the Hunter tier sets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5353-Legion-Hunter-Tier-19-Ret-Paladin-Artifact-Intro-December-9-Hotfixes-Legion-VO).<br />

Any chance we will see a better prot warrior soloing in legion? Gladiator Stance was awesome, and I'm sad to see it go.<br />
All tanks will be excellent at solo play in Legion, and deal respectable damage on top of their great survivability. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674665376899182592))<br />
<br />
What's the intended route for tanks and healers leveling? Grab their artifact then level dps?<br />
Nope! Tanking and Healing specializations are being adjusted to be suitable for leveling as well. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674665598970818560))<br />

Any word yet if Demon Hunters will be expected to use Fel Rush rotationally in raids for aoe damage? Could create problems tbh<br />
We're currently experimenting with a few different options. Possibly only part of sustained AoE via a talent. Feedback welcome! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674664677826101248))<br />

Please do not remove presences. They serve a key role in giving DKs choices in combat, and is a big utility they will miss<br />
We can provide even better ways to make the same defensive choices in combat, and ensure DKs provide enough utility. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674667047503040512))<br />

Any plans to Look at maybe tuning down Savage Roar to ensure the rest of the Feral 100 tier isn't overshadowed by it?<br />
Yes. We're still experimenting with exactly where Savage Roar will go in the talent grid, and will tune accordingly. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674665792751861760))<br />
<br />
I love tree of life form but not the talent, any minor glyphs in the works for treant form model swap or something?<br />
Treant form is sticking around, though it may be via a spell you learn instead of a glyph. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674666464335413248))<br />
<br />
Affinity: as a Guardian with Affinity Owl switching to Owl, can I be targeted by bossabilities only affecting ranged DDs?<br />
None of the Affinities will change the targeting rules that affect you. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674667183838904320))<br />

Hey boss can we get clarification? Will ALL Mech pets be difficult to tame, or just the &quot;Rare&quot; ones Inquireing Gnomes want to know<br />
Currently there are only a few that arent hidden away, we will see how that plays out. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/674421156200374273))<br />

Invisibility pruned from Mages in #Legion? If yes, why? (Epecially in light of the Arcane PvP talent).<br />
Nope, Invisibility is sticking around. Arcane even gets Greater Invisibility baseline. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674667373308215296))<br />

can outlaw rogues get cheap shot back? playing my rogue in legion alpha feels really terrible without it as an opener<br />
CC is being reduced across the board. Outlaws focus on in-combat CC. Instead of Cheap Shot, they use Bribe, Blind, and Gouge. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674666827067187200))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
. Is there any chance of reverting the mount size cap? Even a small one? If the answer is NO then just tell me I'm wasting my time<br />
It was partially reverted in 6.2.3 i think? To allow you to still be like 50% bigger. Don't quote me on that number. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/674403132818894848))<br />
<br />
Any chance we can see crystallized fel being purchasable for all the excess valor that we all have now? 40weeks for 2 rings <br />
That's an interesting idea. Thanks for the suggestion! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674663689039904768))<br />

PvE<br />
please tell me augment runes are a thing of the past<br />

<br />
Lore<br />
Has there been a time skip between WoD and Legion? DH says BC was 10 years ago, but Wrath was only 4 years ago?<br />
The Demon hunters in beta have a /silly joke line that shouldn't be taken as canon, if that's what you mean. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/674716479237951489))<br />
They also say mention being imprisoned for 10 years in some of the quest text though?<br />
Quest name? (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/674717548944883712))<br />
<br />
UI / Addons<br />
will the new transmog system come with the prelaunch event or at launch of Legion?<br />
In general, systems and UI improvements are tied to the pre-launch patch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674663901561094144))<br />

Dont sweat about it cause there is nothing &quot;epic&quot; about the artifacts.Everybody will have your artifact as well,and to get it to max artifact power is not a matter of skill,its a matter of time.Therefore there is nothing special about it ,it just shows the time playing this specific class/spec.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The internet's darling.&quot;<br />
<br />
She's imparted with far more importance and adoration than she deserves, solely because she's an &quot;attractive&quot; female geek who features in the mainstream media occasionally. She's treated as if she's validating all of geekdom by playing her &quot;quirky geek girl&quot; character (the only one she's able to play, by the way) on television.<br />

<br />
Then I look at the Subtlety rogue daggers and get a horrible sinking feeling. They're horrific, and I doubt Blizzard will allow me to transmog the Assassination daggers onto my Sub ones.</div></div><hr />

Don't let it bother you. You have yours and others have theirs. As for The Big Bang Theory only really watched the first few seasons so can't really comment on the later ones.<br />
<br />
I'm super bothered that you are bothered.</div></div><hr />

On a scale of 1-10 how super? :)</div></div><hr />

Back when the Guild started and such yeah it was cool, now it just feels forced as if shes the only semi-quasi-popular Celebrity around Blizzard.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arvandor</div><div class="date">2015-12-13, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">felicia day is famous for her role in supernatural..<br />
<br />
and.. she is not a kiddy queen!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KevyB</div><div class="date">2015-12-13, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Felicia Day is not attractive, yet people say she is. That bothers me.<br />
<br />
She's also extremely annoying. Is she trying to be funny? <br />
<br />
I'm not sure who her fans are. Probably the same people who like Wil Wheaton, the Big Bang theory and other crap!<br />
<br />
You don't even know how right you are...<br />
<br />
Man, the sooner this irrelevant hoe disappears into oblivion, the better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. Maybe it takes X sec to kill the boar in the woods regardless of spec or level? Would be cool!</div></div><hr />

What an embarrassment to female gamers everywhere.</div></div><hr />
