The BlizzCon 2018 Virtual Ticket is now available for purchase and if you’re a World of Warcraft fan you won’t want to miss a moment of the event—or the WoW extras that come with it, including epic in-game goodies and access to the Blizzcon WoW Classic demo at home!<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft® Classic BlizzCon® Demo<br />
Every BlizzCon, we look for opportunities to bring new aspects of the experience to our community around the world. This year, we’re excited to announce that for the first time ever, BlizzCon Virtual Ticket holders will join BlizzCon attendees as the first people to play the World of Warcraft Classic demo we’re creating for BlizzCon at home.<br />
<br />
Shortly after the BlizzCon opening ceremony on November 2 (on or around 1pm PDT), players will be able to download the same in-development BlizzCon WoW Classic Demo that will be playable on the show floor. Players will have a chance to explore and enjoy a limited questing experience through a pair of classic early-level zones—one Horde and one Alliance—and experience firsthand our recreation of the original Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Once the demo is live, you’ll be able to play until 10am PST on November 8, giving BlizzCon attendees a chance to check it out again once they get back home.<br />
<br />
Declare Your Allegiance With BlizzCon In-Game Loot<br />
In addition to access to the BlizzCon WoW Classic Demo, starting today BlizzCon attendees and Virtual Ticket holders will receive commemorative in-game items that will help them proudly display their Horde or Alliance pride as the Battle for Azeroth rages on:<br />
<br />
<br />
War Mantle of the Alliance &amp; War Mantle of the Horde: Show all of Azeroth where your allegiance lies with a pair of faction-themed cosmetic cloaks—one for Horde characters, and one for Alliance.<br />
Stormwind Champion’s War Banner &amp; Orgrimmar Hero’s War Banner: Strike fear into your enemies and stand your ground when you plant your faction’s banner on the battlefield.<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to this year’s WoW items and access to the BlizzCon WoW Classic demo, the Virtual Ticket provides plenty of great BlizzCon content for your viewing pleasure along with additional in-game goodies from Overwatch®, Diablo® III, Hearthstone®, Heroes of the Storm®, and StarCraft® II.<br />

I'm somewhat of the same mind as you. While I plan to check it out at launch, I'm not exactly counting down the days until WoW classic and the cloak would have to be like... highest-detailed cloak model ever in WoW for me to even consider it. If its just another flat sheet of polys with some alpha-channel transparencies, I'll pass.</div></div><hr />

Ya classic will be fun to mess around with at launch but a demo really isn’t needed. The cap is just trash unless it’s a high quaility 3D one which I really doubt it will be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is my thought as well, Classic will be a &quot;I got nothing Better to do, lets knock out 1 or 2 levels&quot; it will never be a priority and knowing my time limits nowadays i may never have a toon at 60. I always buy the VT but never for the rewards i just enjoy watching everything as it happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The cloak would need to be something really high level, high definition, MoP legendary cloak style effects to be worth a mount...</div></div><hr />

Classic access...two starter zones one for each faction. Starter zones people. Like the absolute worst part of the leveling experience available for a couple weeks. This is a serious step back for the virtual ticket.</div></div><hr />

Yeah a demo that probably is set in Elwynn forest, kill 10 defias bandits, kill 10 boars, kill Hogger. Several classes don't even get a decent attack untill level 10, heck Rogues can't even dual wield untill level 10.</div></div><hr />

Very subjective.<br />
<br />
Not everyone is interested in Classic. <br />
<br />
I mean it's a good move on their part nobody is denying it but bear in mind not everyone is interested in a Classic version of the game.<br />

<br />
Blizzard really doesn’t need to put in a mount or pet to justify raising the price if they think what they are actually showing is worth hay raise in price that’s all they need and wow isn’t the only thing at blizzcon. On the same note though I don’t think any of there other games worth a penny which is why I won’t be paying for the ticket the wow stuff there going to show isn’t worth the price and there other games are worthless to me.</div></div><hr />

That's absurd to think that way. That's like saying &quot;Oh they want us to pay for the ticket to physically be there JUST to test it? No thanks.&quot; If you're only going to care about that one single thing, sure.

Oh please. Yes, there are people out there who buy the ticket to watch blizzcon. But let's be real here. Most buy the tickets for the extras. On top of the fact they increased the price this year, what's the big thing you get from the tickets? Test a demo! Usually people are paid to do that.<br />

The fear comes from the price you pay before hand. Sure to put many off getting anywhere near the banners. Me included...<br />

This. ^ <br />
I honestly never understand why people get so hyped up about paying ridiculous prices to test a game in Alphas and Betas when... Just a few years ago people were the ones getting paid to do that. So now YOU're paying for a product that's not finished and may not even like the end result. Makes no sense to me. *shrugs*</div></div><hr />

<br />
The cloak would need to be something really high level, high definition, MoP legendary cloak style effects to be worth a mount...<br />
<br />
They started selling the virtual ticket without any goodies being announced at all. We know we're getting a new Overwatch skin, some HotS stuff, cape and banner for WoW, WoW classic demo and some unknown stuff for Diablo 3, Hearthstone and SC 2.<br />
<br />
Getting a mount was very special becaus almost all the other times all you got was a pet. Getting to play the classic demo is nice but I will wait until all virtual goodies are announced.</div></div><hr />

As a huge Diablo fan, the game that got me to like Blizzard in the first place, I can relate to that feeling.<br />

However, I dont think I will agree this year around. Been enjoying BFA for all it has, and actually do enjoy the opening ceremonies and announcements for most of them.<br />

regardless, that's what the price of the ticket is actually for. you can get two overpriced store mounts for the cost of a blizzcon ticket if thats all you really care about. you're paying for entertainment, and that entertainment just happens to come with a goody bag. it's fine if you don't want to pay for the entertainment offered, but to be mad that the goody bag is shit as if that's what the entire $50 was for is insane to me.</div></div><hr />

No mount, no pet, a worthless toy, and the privilege to alpha test something you've played so long ago that you actually forgot how tedious and boring it was, but in your mind it's a golden age you desperately want to re-live.<br />

Here's an idea, instead of this overpriced garbage, I'd rather get both legion and bfa deluxe upgrades (15e) and a pet (10e); that gives me 2 mounts, 3 pets, and various crap for other games I don't play.</div></div><hr />

I'm not so much complaining, as stating a fact: that I don't consider these rewards worth the increased cost of a virtual ticket. The design of the cloaks are nice, but they're the same 2d/alpha-channeled cloaks we already have in game. And I don't PvP enough to care about the banners.<br />
<br />
Nor do I care about the demo of WoW classic: I'm happy to wait for the launch of the complete product.<br />
<br />
Seeing as I don't play Overwatch, the skin for that is useless to me, and I doubt anything revealed for D3 will be 'must have'. <br />
<br />
I also don't play Hearthstone, brilliant as it may be.<br />
<br />
So yeah, my interest in the VT pretty much hinged exclusively on the WoW stuff. And these are not things I consider to be worth $50.</div></div><hr />

Then there's the WoW Classic demo, which is a demo for a game that Blizzard already produced 14 years ago and is now reselling.<br />

Then there's a cloak.<br />

The design of the cloaks are nice, but they're the same 2d/alpha-channeled cloaks we already have in game. And I don't PvP enough to care about the banners.<br />
<br />
Nor do I care about the demo of WoW classic: I'm happy to wait for the launch of the complete product.<br />
<br />
Seeing as I don't play Overwatch, the skin for that is useless to me, and I doubt anything revealed for D3 will be 'must have'. <br />
<br />
I also don't play Hearthstone, brilliant as it may be.<br />
<br />
So yeah, my interest in the VT pretty much hinged exclusively on the WoW stuff. And these are not things I consider to be worth $50.<br />
<br />
Exactly what i mean. Last time we had a mount. That was pretty damn great. I don't expect one again, mind. But... a cloak is... its a texture. Its literally just a texture. Its nothing special in the slightest... And that Banner...? Im not a fan of random shit to smash on the floor with no use, that disappears after at most 2 minutes.</div></div><hr />

Honestly? Yes. It's what I've received from the last few Blizzcon's that I've bought tickets for, so it's what I genuinely expected. These items though? I literally would not use them. And I have no interest in Vanilla so thats it for me too.</div></div><hr />

No mount, no pet, a worthless toy, and the privilege to alpha test something you've played so long ago that you actually forgot how tedious and boring it was, but in your mind it's a golden age you desperately want to re-live.<br />
<br />
Here's an idea, instead of this overpriced garbage, I'd rather get both legion and bfa deluxe upgrades (15e) and a pet (10e); that gives me 2 mounts, 3 pets, and various crap for other games I don't play.<br />

Act all high and mighty because omg blizzard has my heart, but that doesn’t excuse them from designing poor rewards. The whole point of them is to entice people to buy tickets, mind you.

Nah, I was wrong. I thought for sure it was $45, and even looked it up previously, but it seems the price cited on the virtual ticket page was for the goodie bag (which makes no sense).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't wait to hear more about WoW classic. I already played back then so i do not have a need for a demo were my toon will get wiped but it means 2019 release probably and a heavy focus on Classic for this year. BFA is enjoyable atm from a pvp player perspective. They fixed much from what made Legion PVP so wrong (templates), but being able to do old pve / pvp content again and running in blues without transmog will feel pretty good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those complaining about the pets the mounts, I get it, but they haven’t been special since they started giving them out digitally too<br />
<br />
The only blizcon pets and mounts that hold value and worth a damn are the 05-09 blizzcons when you had to show to get the reward. <br />
<br />
They lost all the luster once they became digital for all.</div></div><hr />

Act all high and mighty because omg blizzard has my heart, but that doesn’t excuse them from designing poor rewards. The whole point of them is to entice people to buy tickets, mind you. So I’m case you were unaware of that fact and really thought they were just looking to give you a reward for being a great customer, just keep in mind this is them selling product.<br />

I bought the ticket to see the panels live. I'm not poor, got plenty of money, so why not get the Virtual Ticket so that I can myself decide what panel to watch, directly from the source instead of watching some poor restream of a fixed panel?<br />
If you are poor, are not interested in the panels, then don't buy the ticket. Simple as that. Just read the news on MMO-C or something after the Blizzcon.<br />

That is very subjective though. How do we know Blizzard hasn't looked into the statistics and noticed that the Blizzcon pets/mounts are barely if ever used? I never used my Murky pets except to show off for 1-2 minutes. A transmog cloak would (for me, not speaking for everyone) get more use/screen time than any pet or mount.<br />
<br />
I never see Blizzcon mounts being used during my time in Orgrimmar. I have almost never seen Blizzcon pets being used in Pet Battles or that someone has taken them out in the world. Will I see the cloak transmogs after this Blizzcon? That remains to be seen. But I am quite sure Blizzard will keep a record to see the usage % and determine what rewards are being used the most, and use that as incentive for future tickets.</div></div><hr />

As has been said before, multiple times, mounts have only come out twice for BlizzCon. This is the twelfth BlizzCon, and a mount came out last year. Do you REALLY expect them to do mounts two years in a row, when we've only seen them every 1 in 6 conventions?</div></div><hr />

Not because i don't like the items, but just because i think $50 is too much for what is basically a promo event for Blizzard. In an age of lots of free content like this on Twitch etc, they decide to raise the price by 25%, i'm just not buying a ticket for that price.</div></div><hr />

I do agree its a subjective line of thought, but I never saw anyone complaining online about those, when they were announced. And we all agree that people will complain about the smallest issue. <br />
I never see anyone using any pets at all tbh, and I for one dont give a damn about them. I only do pet battles while leveling for free experience from dailies quests. I do, however, see those mounts around and I regret not being able to get them anymore. <br />
And cloaks, like I said, are the least popular cosmetic item. An helm, shoulder or weapons would have a way higher chance of approval.</div></div><hr />

cloaks are and always have been the worst looking armor items in wow so i have no idea why theyve chosen a cloak. literally almost every expansion in a q&amp;A you hear the same old tired &quot;when are we getting cloaks like arthas etc&quot; and blizz is always like &quot;we know cloaks kind of suck but were working on it&quot; so why choose a cloak? <br />

If you spend $50 for ONLY that, then I think you have priorities wrong or don't really know what Blizzcon really is about.<br />
I've seen every Blizzcon except last year (as I took a break from almost all of Blizzard games), and every ticket I've bought has been because I wanted to see the panels, talks and reveals. What I receive as Goodie Bag is just a _BONUS_.<br />
<br />
I wonder, if MMO-C people bought tickets to E3, would they do it because of the panels or because they except some &quot;OMFG GODLT GOODIES THAT I NEED BCZ THATS THE ONLY RESON I GO THERE!!!1!&quot;?<br />
<br />
I agree the WoW Virtual Ticket goodie is somewhat of a lackluster, but I also barely used the pets from earlier Blizzcons. Will I use Sombra skin in OW? No, I stopped play OW for a while. I'm still interested in seeing the cinematic they will show and the panels.<br />
<br />
Then again, what else would someone expect of MMO-C comment section except a huge whine-train as usual? :)<br />
<br />
^This. All of this. $50 is for the TICKET. These digital goodies are just fun bonuses they throw in to thank people who bought tickets. If you're legit angry because you don't like the free gifts they are giving you, then you've got issues and need to step away.</div></div><hr />

I hope you're not suggesting 6 days wasn't enough time to get to 60 in Vanilla. The whole &quot;it was actually HARD to reach max level!&quot; meme is a ridiculous exaggeration perpetuated by people who either didn't know how to efficiently level back then, didn't play at all back then, or are simply looking back at it through 10 inches of rose-colored glass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly with so many whiny babies in this post alone over the Virtual ticket, any kind of change to the game (Classic or Retail) will send some peeps into a rage.<br />
<br />
Hope for a graphics toggle too, guess we'll see once we see the demo and more of Blizzard's viewpoints on how they see Classic from their panel. People can say &quot;this is how Classic should be&quot; but ultimately Blizzard determines it all.<br />
<br />
I just want to see more of their thoughts on how Classic will be.</div></div><hr />

These digital goodies are just fun bonuses they throw in to thank people who bought tickets. If you're legit angry because you don't like the free gifts they are giving you, then you've got issues and need to step away.<br />
<br />
Depends why you buy the ticket I guess.<br />
<br />
Generally I'm only interested in Wow stuff which tends to be promoted every other year. I'm expecting this year to be VERY quiet on wow news so was on the fence anyway. But a really good virtual thing might have tipped me over into shelling out the cash and watching the show over the weekend.<br />
<br />
For years the rewards themselves have been pretty good - enough to make up for off-years. Not this one. I'm uninterested in the virtual stuff and don't expect to hear much wow related stuff that won't be posted on this site anyway. So... easy choice not to buy it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And any news on Classic I will just be skipping, so any time it fills up rather than real WoW will just be a deterrent for me.<br />
<br />
Still the no-new-expansion show they put out 2 years ago was an even better Blizzcon than the last one, in my opinion. So it's still tempting me.<br />
<br />
I'll make my decision when the schedule of panels comes out, and will see if there's enough to interest me to warrant actual money spending.</div></div><hr />

Nostalgia can be a pretty strong motivator. But getting excited about a demo for it? Now that's just sad. Classic is already going to pale in comparison to vanilla WoW so a demo which will no doubt only be a small portion of the future playable content is pretty much pointless.</div></div><hr />

Yup I can't wait to run around for 40 levels then have a slow ground mount for the next 20 again haha. Classic, hard pass.

I would imagine this is either backlash from A.) the people who won't play classic because we already have and it's more of a backlash against the higher cost of the virtual ticket with the to each their own opinion lower quality gifts for buying it or B.) the people who are excited about classic and have found out it's a very small amount of quests you can actually do on this demo you get with your ticket. Honestly I think they would've been better off just showing a video of where they are and when they plan on releasing it during the opening ceremony but I just throw money at them monthly not make their decisions.</div></div><hr />

I'm happy for those who will enjoy the cosmetic cloaks and banners, but I wish there was something 'extra' that would actually entice me to buy the ticket. I only watch for the Warcraft-related information, which I can get from fan sites like MMO-Champion and BlizzardWatch. I turn off cloaks on all my characters, and Blizzard writers are busy making my preferred faction into the douchebags yet again, so I'm really not feeling the faction pride for a banner. :|</div></div><hr />

50$ for a 2 days pay-per-view event you mean.<br />
<br />
The demo is something new they try, this means they will eventually do this with other games. I really don't get why people are complaining about this.</div></div><hr />

Well... $50 for access to all the panels and presentations (live / VoD), the playable Classic demo, an Overwatch skin, a HotS mount, two WoW cloaks, and two WoW banners. And there's still some more things to be announced for Hearthstone, StarCraft: Remastered, StarCraft II, and Diablo III.<br />
<br />
Obviously you probably shouldn't fork over the cash unless you're interested in the whole package.</div></div><hr />

Oh come on, you're going to compare the two? One is an entertainment event with a beginning, middle, and ending featuring professionals competing against each other. If you're a boxing fan, you get your money's worth. Blizzcon is essentially a commercial for all of their products. I know how one is entertained is debatable, and if you think it's worth it, by all means, go for it, I just don't think it is worth my money to pay for them advertising their product.</div></div><hr />

That is to watch all the panels and stuff so you do not actually have to physically be there. Like you would have to 100 years ago. No you can sit at home in comfort and watch and event on the other side of the planet.<br />
<br />
The cloak, banner and demo is extra stuff they didn't even have to give you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellrod</div><div class="date">2018-09-27, 04:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh, I have played the game since late vanilla. Not sure I care to pay $50 for a brief walk down memory lane, but I can see why there's added value to this virtual ticket, a classic WoW server demo makes up for the lack of a mount/pet tenfold. Classic Servers along with Vanilla will eventually lose their nostalgic luster once they're out and everyone has played it for a while. Only people playing it after that will be the classic WoW old-heads, a rather niche group.<br />

<br />
Banners and capes are cool until you realize they'll eventually collect dust in your toybox after you forget they're there. Mounts have a lot more freedom and potential to be flashy and interesting. Especially when there's the added exclusivity to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those capes aren't even very interesting as far as capes go. They could've at least done something to make those capes INCREDIBLY flashy and stand out from your average 2D paper-back cape. Maybe give them unique cape physics and particle effects? Add extra layers onto the cape so it doesn't look flat - like making the tassels and chains individually hang off of the cape and billow in the wind? Add a cloak hood that overlaps your normal helmet armor in a similar way that the Christmas outfits do? Maybe give the cape a special animation, or at least a right-click function on the item itself that plays a few trumpets for the Alliance/war drums for Horde. Something small like that would've been nice.<br />
<br />
But no, they're just two unremarkable alliance and horde themed capes, of which there are probably several in-game lookalikes that get across the same faction themes (i.e. the Stormwind and Orgrimmar reputation cloaks). If vanilla WoW's demo weren't here to distract everyone, this would be yet another PR disaster for Blizzard.</div></div><hr />
