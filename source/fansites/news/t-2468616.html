Upcoming Windwalker Monk PTR Change<br />
In the next PTR build*, we‚Äôre looking to test this change:<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, If your primary target of Fists of Fury is dead or despawns, a new primary target will be picked for the purposes of dealing bonus damage to the primary target. It will pick the closest thing to you, unless you already have something else targeted that‚Äôs going to be hit by the damage spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
So this is similar to how Eye Beam picks a target. It should also address Open Palm Strikes (Azerite Trait) sometimes stopping proccing because your main Fists of Fury target has died.<br />
<br />
*This should be soon, but it may be in the public build following the very next one. <br />

Keeping in Touch With Good Players<br />
Here‚Äôs one thing I like to do‚Äì<br />
As soon as I realize ‚ÄúThis is a person I‚Äôd like to group up with again‚Äù, I ask them if they‚Äôre in any Communities they really like, and would be open to having me join. I‚Äôve ended up in a few interesting Communities as a result.<br />
<br />
And Communities show up in the Social tab of your Blizzard Battlenet App (the launcher). Really convenient. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105058-contact-player-from-another-realm/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/102828/6))<br />

Zandalari Racial Still not Nerfed<br />
I‚Äôve been following this subject quite closely throughout this PTR.<br />
<br />
While I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre going to see changes in the very next PTR build (coming ‚Ä¶ you know ‚Äì ‚ÄúSoon‚Äù), I do think you‚Äôre going to see some further tuning in a PTR build after that.<br />
<br />
I would usually move a thread like this one over to the PTR forum, but I think I‚Äôll leave it here with this: As soon as I know exactly what‚Äôs been changed for testing, I‚Äôll post about it in the PTR forum. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105056-zandalari-still-not-nerfed/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/105875/136))<br />

Kul Tiran and Zandalari Unlock Requirements and Faction Change<br />
I‚Äôve completed all the above on my only 120 character. If I was to faction change to alliance now, would I still be able to unlock Zandalari, or do I need to wait till the unlock quest chain is live before faction changing?<br />
Sorry for the delay, but I got some details related to characters that swap factions and these requirements! If you do a faction change your reputations will switch over but quest completion does not, so if you want to qualify to unlock the kul tiran/zandalari you will need to do the main storyline for that continent and faction.<br />
<br />
Note that for the War Campaign aspect, if you got to exalted with 7th Legion/Honorbound then you can just do all the chapters without any delays to gain more reputation.

Its a MMO and not a survival shooter game with skins.<br />
Anything instant access in WoWs past was a huge failure, why would you ever want something that never worked out well in any MMO?<br />
<br />
This is just on the same silly level as hardware topics about WoW FPS problems vs Shooter FPS problems, yes lets compare static games with MMO architecture, some players should just stick to mobile games.</div></div><hr />

let's be fair, it's not like everyone leveled up the new races in other expansions, as it happens with allied races, the ones who want to level them up, do it, the ones who don't want to, pay. No time-gating will make people or stop them to pay a race change, and this is a fact. Comparing allied races with new races from other expansions and saying something like &quot;this is just so people race change or buys a boost&quot; it's not valid since it did happen before, it's happening now and it will keep happening. The difference would be the heritage armor, one can like it or not ofc, I like the velf heritage armor and didn't boost or race change him not only because of the money, but because I wanted that heritage armor.<br />
<br />
I don't want to sound like a full time job whiteknight, but people need to get things right before they talk, are allied races a cash grab? of course they are, but at least it's not mandatory to pay for that race change or boost, the same as older races.<br />
<br />
I paid to make my doggie DK a human, I was 2 lazy to level up one, it's the fault of blizzard? no it's mine because it's my money and my time and I chose how to spend it, not them, it's also not the fault of allied races, it's a nice system built on a world who punish people that don't want to invest X hours leveling them up, but being an mmo, it's really punishing you? or just working as intended? this last question is more personal for the player, and not something in blizzard's hands. unless they want to power up and extend the instant gratification to leveling up too, apart from itemization.</div></div><hr />

Maybe the assumption is that players want to play the game, AKA if they pay for access, it's because they have no problem with going through the content...?<br />

So many MMO-C posters are clearly &quot;over&quot; the game, but just unable to move on. They take any and all designs as an affront and personal insult to children in the 3rd world + their own mother just so they can be outraged.<br />
<br />
In the end, the game is designed around the idea that if you pay, you want to play. Simple.<br />
Do they grab cash from players too impatient to level a new character? Sure, but then that player doesn't get rewarded with the Heritage armor. And in the end it's that player's decision to spend additional money or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, the thing is, that you are not forced to race change or boost them, as you did before with the new races, it's exactly the same, the difference is that there are more now. And please, you don't need to &quot;grind&quot; to get them, even the most casual player, has them unlocked by now. Hell, I only played a lot the first 3 weeks of BFA, and cleared a lot of WQ the first 3 or 4 days, after that I just raid and I got everything to exalted, I connect, I do anything I want to do to get some Ilvl, maybe something fun with a friend, but mainly I only connect to raid with my guildies and we have tons of fun, and I'm ok with that, I have time for other games and my social life.<br />
<br />
Now, that pushing back zandalari has something behind? yeah. Blizzard said that it was because of KT and it made sense, but I agree that they took into account the MAU's 2, yet that doesn't mean they did it entirely for the MAU's, it was a factor out of many others.<br />
<br />
You wanted your zandalari at start? and bought the expansion for them? then I'm sorry it's your fault you &quot;wasted your money&quot; because they have said since beta of BFA I think that they wouldn't come out at launch, and anyone who has the time to come here at a fan forum and post something about &quot;omg I paid since the start expecting to have them and I didn't, I paid only for them!&quot; I'm sorry but I don't think you were really interested in them, you didn't even look for information about them in the forums, but you could connect to the forums to post your opinion?<br />
<br />
Blizzard did bad pushing back zandalari even if it made sense, because they announced at the blizzcon of 2017 that they would be on launch and should have gone with it, but they did apologize and gave information with enough time that they wouldn't be avaliable at launch.<br />
<br />
As Taliesin and Bellular said, please try to think more and criticize the right things at the right time, that's the best, for us players and the game.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I know this has nothing to do with this thread, but if you pay for origin access (15‚Ç¨ here in EU a month) it has Anthem in it. I will chill and have fun with a couple of friends playing it, and since I don't think I will play it more than a month, 15‚Ç¨ since like a good price for a little of fun with some friends ^^<br />
<br />
Cheers! ^^</div></div><hr />

I am still playing it, my guild are still playing it, and we're still having fun -- otherwise, we wouldn't still be playing it.<br />

<br />
Or you could do the mature thing and move on...?<br />
<br />
Last night doing a faction assault, the areas were packed with players. The game is made for them, not the likes of you to whom the game is clearly dead.<br />

I am still playing it, my guild are still playing it, and we're still having fun -- otherwise, we wouldn't still be playing it.<br />
So no, they shouldn't just &quot;end this trash MMO&quot;.<br />

Exactly.<br />
<br />
The game is made for people who want to play it. That's what makes the crowd of negative Nancies so miffed, since in their world the game exists on the graces that it pleases THEM.</div></div><hr />

I wanted to do it Nightfallen, but it just takes to much time to reach exalted with them, I discovered that Zandalari are upright so I‚Äôll probably stick with them.</div></div><hr />

Anything instant access in WoWs past was a huge failure, why would you ever want something that never worked out well in any MMO?<br />
<br />
This is just on the same silly level as hardware topics about WoW FPS problems vs Shooter FPS problems, yes lets compare static games with MMO architecture, some players should just stick to mobile games.<br />
<br />
Yea cause Blood Elves are a huge failure right? /sarcasm</div></div><hr />
