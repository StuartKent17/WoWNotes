Warlords of Draenor - Alliance Chopper: 100,000 Gold<br />
An item that costs 100,000 http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/august/gold.png was added to Paulie of Old Town Choppers in the latest beta build. The latest build also added the chopper's mount spell (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/171846-champions-treadblade) with Paulie listed as the source. Jonathan LeCraft confirmed there will be no rep discount (https://twitter.com/TheCrafticus/status/497419150151925760).<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Mount Journal UI<br />
Speaking of new mounts, Warlords of Draenor has added some nice upgrades to the mount UI:<br />
<br />
<br />
The journal now lists a source and description for mounts.<br />
You are now able to set mounts as favorites, putting them at the top of the list.<br />
There is a new Summon Random Favorite Mount button, which selects a usable mount at random from your favorites.<br />
Mounts that are faction specific now have a different background in the list.<br />
<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Leveling Experience Changes<br />
The latest beta builds have increased the experience required to level by 30% for each level from 89 to 99. At level 90, quests give ~15k XP and mob kills give 500 XP.<br />

New World of Warcraft Comic - Gul'dan and the Stranger<br />
Blizzard released a new comic today in PDF form.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/august/guldanComic.jpg (https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/Z5EDRREGHRLM1406310705908.pdf) <br />
<br />
The drums of war have begun to sound for Draenor’s orcs, and the power-mad warlock Gul’dan is the latest to play them. Brimming with fel energy, Gul’dan is convinced that his people will gain glory and strength if they only kneel to the demonic Burning Legion. But a hooded stranger has recently arrived in Gul’dan’s camp with a somewhat... contradictory vision.<br />
<br />
The stranger has walked in places where terrifying war machines will soon shake the earth. From the smoldering ridges of Gorgrond to the hunting grounds of Nagrand, he watches over the orcish ranks, stoking their dreams of a united Horde: pure (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/characters/garrosh-hellscream), free, and utterly dominant. And he has a message for Gul'dan.<br />
<br />
We invite you to read and download (https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/Z5EDRREGHRLM1406310705908.pdf) the free comic, “Gul’dan and the Stranger (https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/Z5EDRREGHRLM1406310705908.pdf),” written by Micky Neilson and illustrated by Alex Horley.<br />

Racials<br />
Is there a reason why the undead racial is not scaling and every other race do?<br />
The fact that it's not a % and others are does not mean that it doesn't scale and they do. Its damage does scale with other stats. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494007010904387584))<br />
Whereas something like 1% crit could also be read as 130 crit rating, which &quot;doesn't scale&quot; just as much (but still really does). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494007156786483201))<br />
<br />
The troll beast exp racial needs to go, I want stay a troll druid, but will always min/max! Just a pointless racial with endgame<br />
Yes, it's a useless racial at endgame. But so what? It doesn't make trolls any worse at endgame. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494200438590173184))<br />

Is there any chance to give Death Grip a 8yrd minimum range like charges, so they can't use it as an interrupt<br />
You won't be able to do it twice in Warlords. Giving up your only gap closer to stop a cast is a reasonable tradeoff (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494239967485259776))<br />
<br />
also, I know you have heard it a ton of time. Is there ANY hope that our only raid CD, AMZ, can get moved out of talents?<br />
We're still satisfied with AMZ being a talent. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494688680343130112))<br />
Raiding is only part of the game, and it's not necessarily ideal in all, or even most raid encounters. It's a viable choice. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494688953492975618))<br />
<br />
Blood is by far the least engaging tank. I still love them, but it seems like they are being made even more bare bones.<br />
I would definitely disagree with you. Rotational simplicity does not mean shallowness. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494912953947144194))<br />
Actually, unless there's some interesting interaction between abilities that's exactly what a simpler rotation means!<br />
But there are more interesting interactions between abilities. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494951597105872897))<br />

With the Hunter pets no longer having crowd-control abilities (My sha-spider will cry) how will Hunters crowd control? <br />
Freezing Trap, Narrow Escape, Binding Shot / Intimidation / Wyvern Sting. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494234089260453888))<br />

still no change to fire. Please consider synchronizing Prismatic Crystal better with Fire's only dps CD.<br />
Prismatic Crystal already 2.3x's the value of Combustion, due to spreading it via Inferno Blast. No need. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494362929735536640))<br />

Are you OK with the totem talent tier, especially for DPS spec in PvE ? Many Sham say &quot;meg&quot; about this talent row.<br />
It's not a great talent row. We see it as being not actively bad, just pretty &quot;meh&quot;, as you say. We'd like to improve or... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494740284559740928))<br />
...replace it at some point, but it's not at the top of our list of priorities at the moment, since it's not causing problems (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494740471810236416))<br />
You said the totem tier isnt a great talent row. Isnt it because the whole totem mechanism is a bit old and need a rework ?<br />
A) Spamming doesn't help. B) Designs aren't bad because they get &quot;old&quot;. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494916649560977411))<br />
<br />
Why does elemental blast not have a healing component for resto? Its the only dps talent without a healing component.<br />
Granting you increased Spirit is effectively a healing component, by giving you more mana to cast more expensive heals. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494908612339187712))<br />
So it's purely a resource building spell with a 2 second cast time?<br />
I don't think that &quot;purely&quot; is an appropriate word for it. It does damage, some of a random stat, and a bunch of spirit. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/494916257993326593))<br />

You changed the tooltip on Burning rush in Beta; I need some clarification please. Can we absorb this self-afflicted damage?<br />
It's now like any other DoT. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/493986793260208129))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
I cant invite someone to a group to share a tag if I'm queued for a dungeon w/o losing q<br />
That's a terrible quality of life issue, and is one we'd like to fix. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/493970384518008833))<br />
<br />
any chance we can get a guaranteed fresh LFR at least for first one each week? sucks sitting for 2 hour long queues<br />
So then backfilling LFR on the first evening of the week would be literally impossible? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/494590626252345345))<br />
If you've killed the final boss of an LFR wing, you're at least guaranteed a fresh instance if you requeue. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/494590748130414592))<br />
<br />
I've gotta know. Some kind of anti-pet boss damage mechanism? Staghelm etc. hit my Tenacity pet much harder than they do me.<br />
Many raid bosses are flagged to do triple damage when meleeing player pets. We really don't want pets tanking raid bosses. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/493980648491589633))<br />
Can we have that NOT interfere with soloing old content, please?<br />
This has been this way for literally 5 years. It's not some new system. Pet classes can solo just fine despite it. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/494703984423100419))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Will there be timers for bg's built into the UI in WoD?<br />
Unfortunately no. High on the todo list tho. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494506156803366912))<br />
There's an add-on called bgtimers out there that might help you. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494596390568198144))<br />
<br />
Can you gear up playing in Ashran only or will bgs/arenas be required for highest end? (ratings?)<br />
You can earn conquest in Ashran, but it won't increase your cap. So it's doable, but not the most efficient route. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494601704029966336))<br />
<br />
Will there be pve incentives to go to ashran as well<br />
It will have some endgame rewards in common with other zones so it will be worthwhile for PvE players too. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494605331159216130))<br />
<br />
What do you feel is a fair criteria for CC that's bad for the game? Is there a clear line for you?<br />
We should shoot to have counters to everything. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494604236668157955))<br />
Prediction-counters or post-hit counters? If former, what's a counter to e.g. Storm Bolt? Instant, ranged, undispellable, free.<br />
WoW PvP is a team game and teammate play has to be considered a counter. In this case, how do you react to Stormbolt. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494614984131747841))<br />
And, for some comps, there is no reaction counter either, depending on what the purpose of its use was.<br />
Prevention is one counter. Reaction is another. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494617977136766976))<br />
<br />
Currently there're 620(675 in pvp) blues and 660(690 in pvp) epics in database. Is this going to be the gear system in 6.0?<br />
Yes those are the ilevels for the Veteran Honor gear and Conquest gear respectively. Honor gear is 600 (660 in pvp). (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494673407238094851))<br />
<br />
how's tank viability in pvp comin along?<br />
I actually think they have a really fun role in the large Ashran fights. They really push the fight forward. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494601307315916800))<br />
<br />
Will Garrisons have any PvP integration? Any reason for PvPers to be excited about Garrisons aside from building bonuses?<br />
There will be some PvP elements. More to come. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/494946093319192577))<br />

Not related to feather color or anything obvious to non-arakkoa. They appear androgynous to other races. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/493922329500459008))<br />

Will ingame Thrall be renamed to Go'el anytime soon? Every character in War Crimes calls him like that already.<br />
In-game only very close intimates call him Go'el. Most characters will continue to refer to him as &quot;Thrall.&quot; (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/494224975713148928))<br />

Please reconsider no dailies; they're something to do beyond dungeon grinding, and give a way to make money besides profs and AH<br />
There are many more things to do in the outdoor world, and more ways to make money. We just found things more fun than blue !s. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/494401601638260736))<br />
dailies can tell a story; timeless isle-esque grinding doesnt. Is the world stuff just grinding mobs and having to play AH?<br />
Much more than grinding and AH. Real story quests, guided attacks on enemy bases, many garrison efforts. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/494565912758861824))<br />

...thus making the bike more rare and actually worth riding. The Horde bike will be everywhere and after the first month or so, no one will really ride it anymore. The Alliance bike, on the other hand, will be less common and those that do ride it will feel like it was a good 100k spent due to the monetary exclusivity!</div></div><hr />

I doubt it, because if that was how it worked, why would anyone buy the mount when all they would have to do is make a Horde character and claim the Horde bike to get the Alliance bike?<br />

Well, I was hoping to avoid re-subbing until WoD. Not like 6.0 will really introduce much to keep me playing. At the earliest I might re-sub for the anniversary stuff, 40 man MC and stuff might be fun enough to justify it.</div></div><hr />

First off, three things there are not the same thing or even remotely related, second, I am damn near gold cap and I will not purchase a bike with 1 seat, or even a second empty one for 100k, I don't usually join in on bitching and moaning, but this is outright ridiculous. Third, lumping in flying, having fun, and this chopper, as being together, as I already mentioned once, makes no sense at all.</div></div><hr />

There was no possible way the Alliance would have ever won that. This was nothing more then another means to &quot;Faction bait&quot; again. Blizzard does this all the time at Blizzcon, and other public events. Just watching Azeroth Choppers, you can clearly tell Metzen was only on the Alliance team, merely for the sake of PR. There is no &quot;Alliance Pride&quot; another. Every time someone says they play Alliance, there's always some retarded Horde players calling them fa**ots, or some shit. The majority of the Horde is made up of these little shits, who think they're so fucking cool because they're an Undead, or Orc. Mix that with Blizzard's blatant favoritism, and you're got yourselves one massive clusterfuck of entitlement. I feel sorry for the Alliance at this point. 100k for a god damn mount?

Believe it or not, but not everyone who plays WoW treats the AH as a mini-game, or wants to spend hours on end farming mats to sell on the AH, or grind dailies for gold.<br />

It is a small percentage, and as someone who does treat the AH as a mini-game, even I think this is some massive BS on pricing, it is either NOT DONE YET, which I hope is the case, or they really are out of touch.</div></div><hr />

You are thinking of the mount in terms of one that you can buy right away. Sure, a small amount will. The idea wasn't really to have everyone on it right away though or at least that was my understanding. I mean every expansion there are gold sinks that are pretty much just vanity items, that give people something to strive for. A carrot on a stick if you will. People are a) comparing it to a yak instead of say, a magic rooster, and b) comparing it to all horde get their mount immediately, surely it would be a price that all ally would get it immediately. It's kind of entitled. To be fair I think for the majority of playerbase you could drop it to about 60k it's still a carrot for people to work towards buying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much, if it stays this price, which I think is likely now they haven't countered it and the rep thing.<br />
<br />
No passengers, no vendor, no flight, no point unless you like the look, which some do, but from the evidence of the vote, and the vast majority of what has been posted for weeks, most hate it.<br />
<br />
Can't say I like it myself, I even voted Horde because it looked far better and I don't have a single high level horde char.<br />
<br />
I have more than 100k but I'd wager 90% of players are closer to 10k or less, and there's another thing, at least personally, I've found the more gold I made, the less I'd spend/want to spend, and I've wasted plenty of gold, getting the cenarion mount and the quel'danas example back when it was current, my friends thought I was nuts paying 1k for a title and 2k? (iirc) for a mount back then.</div></div><hr />

First off, three things there are not the same thing or even remotely related, second, I am damn near gold cap and I will not purchase a bike with 1 seat, or even a second empty one for 100k, I don't usually join in on bitching and moaning, but this is outright ridiculous. Third, lumping in flying, having fun, and this chopper, as being together, as I already mentioned once, makes no sense at all.<br />
<br />
They are all related or have you not been reading any of these forums? They are bullet points for the whiner crowd that have crowned themselves as the victims in everything Blizzard does. They are each symptoms of a much greater disease. Once you label yourself a victim, you have to keep labeling yourself a victim.<br />
<br />
No where did I say anything about the 100k for the bike. Are you projecting your own concerns into my post? I simply stated that Blizzard can handle any blow back from the community and that most people will have fun regardless of what the same hand full of people on this forum say.<br />

There was no possible way the Alliance would have ever won that. This was nothing more then another means to &quot;Faction bait&quot; again. Blizzard does this all the time at Blizzcon, and other public events. Just watching Azeroth Choppers, you can clearly tell Metzen was only on the Alliance team, merely for the sake of PR. There is no &quot;Alliance Pride&quot; another. Every time someone says they play Alliance, there's always some retarded Horde players calling them fa**ots, or some shit. The majority of the Horde is made up of these little shits, who think they're so fucking cool because they're an Undead, or Orc. Mix that with Blizzard's blatant favoritism, and you're got yourselves one massive clusterfuck of entitlement. I feel sorry for the Alliance at this point. 100k for a god damn mount? That's just overkill, and another middle finger.<br />

Someone sure is booty bothered about some pixels, wow.<br />

A contest meant that the alliance bike should of never EVER even been in game, correct? People complained about how it looked , but still QQed about not being able to get it.<br />
<br />
Finally they said they were gonna put it in game but that IT WOULD BE EXPENSIVE.<br />
<br />
Getting this bike shouldn't be as easy as getting some random rep mounts, it shouldn't of even been in game! 100K is more then fair considering the background of the bike itself.<br />
<br />
And by god..If you do not have 100K saved up at this time in the expansion or even 200K + you are doing something wrong<br />
<br />
Another strong example that majority of the wow community always needs to QQ to have their way. 10$ says this would of been on the Shop for 25$ you all would of bought it.</div></div><hr />

Take the bike that lost horribly in the polls, and tell the people who weren't even that fond of it that it'll cost them 100k gold.<br />
<br />
To be completely honest, no, I could not afford at it this time, but saving up 100k has not been impossible for me in the past. Something as ugly as the Alliance mount though will not convince me to make the effort to save up, nor would I buy it if I had a million gold.</div></div><hr />

Well, if a player's goal was to make gold, then they should have that much money by now, and if they don't they would have done something wrong. But plenty of players, including me, don't give a shit about gold, don't even try making more gold than we need for mats. Now players in that position shouldn't complain about the price of a vanity item. But I wouldn't say we've done anything &quot;wrong&quot;.</div></div><hr />

You'd be surprised how many people I come across in-game that struggle having 10 or even 3k gold at any given time. Moaning and bitching about flasks, enchants, food and gems being expensive and how they can't afford repairs.<br />
<br />
I'd really like to know what the hell they are doing. I have 3-5k on EACH of my alts that I have accumulated only through playing them. No AH, no fancy stuff...just doing LFR, dungeons, dailies (IOT for honor) and so on...and I don't play my alts half as much as I play my main. This is the first expansion where I haven't been forced to funnel gold from my main into my alts, since they earn their upkeep.</div></div><hr />

So, in summary, Horde-side won the contest because they took the contest more seriously because of faction pride, and their bike looked better. Sounds fair to me.<br />

I agree with everything except the first line and &quot;C&quot;. The original thing about the contest that they stated was that ONE faction would get a mount and one would NOT. It doesn't matter what the community thought would/should happen the fact is the contest was giving one faction a mount and the other faction got nothing. Now, rather than keep to it they decided to be generous and allow the other faction to also receive the mount. At this point, Alliance players should only be grateful/pleased that they are allowed to get a mount that they were originally &quot;not&quot; suppose to get. <br />
<br />
It somewhat sucks but in the end it is a fair and just price, 100k isn't that hard and this is coming from someone who plays at most 3 hours a day (except raid days) and hates making gold.</div></div><hr />

This is actually very true...I've always found it hilarious. For instance, they could literally make a @#$#@ on a stick transmogrify weapon, put it on a vendor for 500k gold - and people would buy it up and use it simply because it is &quot;rare.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Don't forget how much gold scales in each expansion too. I remember having 2K or 3K gold in wrath and feeling rich beyond belief, in MoP I felt the same way when I had 25 or 30K gold sitting around.

Ah, the gasping, wheezing of the min/maxers. Always trying to eek out little advantages in the game, unnecessary so. All that attitude ever did was encourage a broken, imbalanced game.

Speaking of rare mounts, I have made a discovery recently. If you won the &quot;Swift Alliance Steed&quot; back in TOC days, you may have found that winning it didn't translate when you logged onto a horde character, or vice versa. There never seemed to be a good reason for this. <br />
<br />
Well, no more. Not sure when it happened, but my horde characters finally have the &quot;Swift Horde Wolf&quot; available to them, which is definitely new and different. <br />
<br />
So if you were lucky enough to get the mount (either faction) now your characters in both factions can use their versions of it. Not even wowhead has this information, as of two days ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like it's Blizzard's fault that you like troll but are a min/maxer!<br />
<br />
People like this make me want to murder Gamon over and over and over and over. Well, actually, since he's a friendly NPC now (screw you Blizzard) I can't do that, but the sentiment remains accurate. <br />
<br />
This is a case of wanting to have your cake and eat it, too. There will always be choices with pros and cons. Which ones are pros and which are cons are personal to the individual, and it's up to the individual to decide what they want or are willing to trade off!<br />
<br />
Now, if one is super super super OP and the other is poop (thanks Tziva for the terminology! :3 ) then that isn't fun, but improve on the poop one instead of bringing the OP one down to poop-level (instead of maybe balancing it better). Entirely removing a racial is not a solution.<br />
<br />
This also reflects how I feel about those who called for Blizzard to remove combat perks from professions. GG.</div></div><hr />

You should be happy you even got a shot at the mount after Horde won.</div></div><hr />

I PROMISE you, the Richest will buy it, just to say they could buy it.<br />
<br />
For all the complaints about the outrageous price, I think its outrageous price is perfect for a bike that wasn't even supposed to make it in Game in the first place, in case you guys/gals don't remember!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep the price of this mount is going to kill WoW... do you even think before talking/typing? Like I said earlier the Alliance should be appreciative that Blizzard felt sorry for you and even gave you an option to get the mount. But it's very clear this is another way for the same people that cry about everything else in the game to try and get what they want, if the QQ'ing continues I'm sure they'll drop the price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The grand expedition mount was 108k and im not even mad bout that cause it had a use. Vendors and reforge!<br />
<br />
I was thinkin more around 30-50k TOPS!<br />
<br />
Shitty Alliance lost a competition, thats why it is so expensive.<br />
You should be lucky the alliance is getting their chopper anyway.<br />
Always those crystorm of em' 14 year old alliance kids...</div></div><hr />

<br />
They should increase the cap i'll agree there however 100k gold isn't a lot nowadays. Unless you sit in the shrine and spam trade all day. If you actually play the game you can make thousands a day no AH or farming required. With garrisons and just gold scaling up you will make a ton more in wod. I plan on having 9 Garrisons (This probably wont be normal lol) that is 18 extra professions. That is a crap ton of gold potential.<br />
<br />
<br />

To be fair if Alliance won there would be horde complainers as well</div></div><hr />

Getting gold is easier than ever before. I mean you only have to accumulate 100k one time and it you don't have to even get it all on one toon necessarily. It's going to be a snap for me on my ally server. 11 Characters.....which means I have to get less than 10k per character...pool it all together and every character has a new mount. Chances are by the time I get done just leveling all my characters from 90 to 100 they'll all have 10k or more on them without having to do anything extra</div></div><hr />

<br />
and<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't understand why everyone is all butthurt over 100k gold.&quot; It's because in comparison to every other mounts available this one doesn't do jack to justify the price. <br />
<br />
- Current chopper can be acquired for 12-13k. - Carries 2nd passenger<br />
- Mammoth is 16-20k - Carries Vendor and 2 passengers<br />
- Yak is 100k-120k- Carries Vendor, Reforger, and 2 passengers.<br />
<br />
Blizz went this route with the JC mounts and the Engineering rockets this expac though. The Panthers have done alright, primarily the cheap ones though. Engineering rockets have had mediocre success, a lot of people just plain don't like them, but the price tag doesn't help.<br />
<br />
But even those two have something the chopper doesn't. They fly. The chopper is nothing more than a solo ground mount. 100k is overpriced. So regardless of how easy it would be to obtain 100k leveling alts, many won't buy it for legitimate reasons. If you want to go ahead, I'll be joining the former. It's just not worth the gold that I'd rather spend on something more useful.</div></div><hr />

Horde. Exactly. Alliance is the silent majority, but whored clearly cheated their way in to a free mount.</div></div><hr />
