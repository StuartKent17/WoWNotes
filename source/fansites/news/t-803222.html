Players can no longer skin Crushcog Sentry-Bots or Crushcog Battle Suits in Dun Morogh... because they don’t have skin.<br />
The grace time for players who have disconnected from a Battleground has been increased to three minutes before being issued the Deserter debuff.<br />
Stats on the Weather-Beaten Fishing Hat have been reduced, as it can currently be equipped by players of all levels.<br />
Crafty players again found a way to catch Cataclysm fish. Crafty designers have made this impossible without a Cataclysm key attached to a player’s account.<br />
Revitalizing Sandals now have an enchantment of +1 Intellect.<br />
Ravenous Jaws off the coast of Icecrown grew strangely large and have been returned to their normal size.<br />

<br />
Rake is now dealing the same damage outside of Cat Form when the druid has the Razor Claws mastery. Rake damage also stays consistent when modified by Mangle as a druid shifts out of Cat Form.<br />
The proc buff from the talent Shooting Stars should no longer be consumed without providing its benefits if the druid is already casting Starsurge.<br />

<br />
Silithid Swarmers are now tamable by hunters.<br />
Hunter pets that changed pet families prior to patch 4.0.3 will no longer retain their previous talents on top of the new Cataclysm pet talents. Hunters will have to untalent their pets to pick up this correction.<br />

<br />

<br />
Smite's scaling coefficient has been increased. The damage of Smite is now very similar to Heal in value. This change has been made to ensure the Archangel Discipline sub-specialization remains viable.<br />
The presence of the Word of Glory effect from the paladin talent Guarded by the Light will no longer prevent casting or get overwritten by Power Word: Shield.<br />
Killing priests with the Spirit of Redemption talent now correctly awards Honor, killing blows and Honorable Kills. Also, abilities that proc off of killing blows like Victory Rush are now proccing properly when a priest is talented into Spirit of Redemption.<br />

Quests<br />
<br />
The Horde version of the Ashenvale Quests achievement now requires 62 Ashenvale quests completed, down from 80.<br />
The Alliance version of the Un’Goro Crater Quests achievement now requires 40 Un’Goro Crater quests completed, down from 45.<br />

Razgar’s Fillet Knife and Drowned Thunder Lizard Tail are now removed from a player’s inventory upon completing the quest “A Golden Opportunity” in Orgrimmar.<br />

Teegan Holloway for the quest “The Looting of Althalaxx” in Darkshore has had his respawn time decreased.<br />
Warlord Thresh'jin for the quest &quot;Out of the Ziggurat&quot; in Eastern Plaguelands can now be looted by all players in a party.<br />

Blue Posts<br />
City Tabards<br />
If you are wearing one of the new faction tabards (e.g. Thunder Bluff, Stormwind, Orgrimmar, Ironforge, etc.), you will only receive reputation gains for that city/faction when in Classic (1-60), Northrend (70-80), and Cataclysm (80-85) dungeons. Outland dungeons will not currently provide reputation gains for the &quot;home city&quot; faction you are championing; this is intended.<br />
<br />
Also, just as a heads up, if dungeon mobs and bosses are trivial to you, you will receive less reputation than if they are within your level range. This is just to ensure that players who exceed the dungeon's intended level range can still benefit from championing a specific faction, but aren't given a distinct advantage over those who are of the appropriate level and are unable to solo the content. This should also help encourage players to improve their reputation in dungeons more appropriate for their level, rather than running lower level content solely for the reputation (which isn't a bad thing by any means; we just want you to enjoy the content designed for your level range, too). :)<br />
<br />
[...] For a period of time after patch 4.0.3a launched, Wrath of the Lich King dungeons did not provide reputation gains if a new faction tabard was worn. This was hotfixed, however, shortly after Sapperwix's post on November 24: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/1232869#blog<br />
<br />
After speaking with our designers further (as promised earlier in this thread) and reexamining how our hotfix was applied together, Inushi was indeed correct and new faction tabards will only provide reputation gains for the championed city in Northrend if the dungeon is Heroic or otherwise level 80. This is how the current tabard system works for Wrath of the Lich King, but we may consider revising the system to include all dungeons, regardless of level, in a future patch.<br />
<br />
Apologies for the confusion! I've already amended my first post to ensure it reflects this information. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/138803/city-tabards-and-bc-dungeons))<br />
<br />
This still doesn't answer why no rep with regular non 80 wrath instances while wearing the city tabard.<br />
Similar to Outland dungeons, there are technical limitations which we must first overcome for this to be possible. It's a bit complicated, but hopefully I can explain.<br />
<br />
In Wrath of the Lich King, we implemented a system that allowed players to champion factions by wearing a corresponding tabard; however, that system was limited and only supported level 80 dungeons (including Heroics). Fortunately, we were able to incorporate the new city tabards into this system through a hotfix, but the same rules and restrictions still apply. If we want to allow the new city tabards to provide reputations gains in all Northrend dungeons, we'll have to completely retrofit the entire Wrath of the Lich King tabard system -- which is something we may consider tackling in a future patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/138803/city-tabards-and-bc-dungeons))<br />
<br />
Disconnected in Battlegrounds / Deserter debuff<br />
This is a bug for which we have developed a hotfix. Unless you type &quot;/logout&quot; while in a Battleground, you should be given a three-minute grace period when disconnected to log back in without the Deserter debuff.<br />
<br />
This hotfix is not yet active on live realms as it will require cross-realm restarts. It should be fixed by tomorrow. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/139489/please-do-something-about-the-battlegrounds))<br />

Beginner Tooltips<br />
For a veteran gamer like yourself, it's understandable that the Beginner Tooltips might be a bit jarring. But, before you write them off as an embarassment, think back to when you first began playing World of Warcraft. Or, if you were already familiar with MMORPGs at the time, think back instead to when you were initially introduced to another complex gaming environment. It was likely a bit overwhelming.<br />
<br />
Between clicking all the interface buttons, discovering how the combat system operates, learning how to move your character, adjusting those complex camera angles, and figuring out why that knight over there is wearing an exclamation point as a hat, there's a lot of data for new players to process -- and those first few minutes of playing, prior to our most recent improvements, could sometimes feel like you were getting shot in the face. In the face.<br />
<br />
You may have had a different experience, of course -- and if you did, that's awesome! -- but for a number of new players, their introduction to World of Warcraft was a bit disorienting. No bueno! To help combat that early game confusion, we streamlined a lot of beginning content including tooltips, ensuring that the first set you see when you log in clearly describes what a specific type of spell or ability actually does. In combination with other quest and UI enhancements, the entire new player experience is now more meaningful and better at introducing game mechanics to those who are otherwise unfamiliar with them.<br />
<br />
Now, if you're wondering why Beginner Tooltips is selected by default, this is because new players -- those who would most thoroughly benefit from this feature -- probably aren't going to know how or where to turn them on. While this may sometimes catch our more seasoned adventurers off-guard, we know you guys have an understanding of how to modify in-game settings and can likely deduce how to disable them on your own, either by poking around the interface menu or by asking for assistance on our community forums. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/139578/spell-skill-and-ability-descriptions))<br />

Glyphs and new players<br />
(Perhaps one suggestion I could make would be for a class trainer to give you a set of 3 glyphs appropriate to your spec - but make these new, weaker glyphs - worth using but also worth replacing as soon as you can afford to.)<br />
I think that's actually a pretty kickass suggestion, and one I will bring up. I don't doubt it's something that's been thought of already, but may bear repeating. (repeating bear says *rawr*)<br />
<br />
Having a character customization/power system dependent on the market means there is going to be a rub when asking new players to spend their new-player amounts of cash on well-aged-game inflation rates. I also don't think it's realistic to think that new players are going to make inscription buddies or choose inscription (or maybe any profession) themselves.<br />
<br />
Of course the use of glyphs is really not going to make or break the game for you while leveling, and really maybe even at late levels/end-game to varying degrees. It's potentially also a stretch to think that it will be completely forgotten. BUT! fundamentally, good idea. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/139575/glyphs-at-25-a-cruel-joke))<br />

Really!?! Because they haven't raped Inscription enough already? For that guy crying what's next. Is he going to come onto the forums and say &quot;hey, you know blue boes are really expensive at level 19, I think you should give out a good set&quot;. <br />
<br />
I've done the new quests, it isn't hard by any means to make money now on them. Level 30 and you are getting rewards worth 1g to vendor. This is just a clear case of I wants it noa, give it. I really can't stand that. Things feel so much better if you really work for them. Now to clarify I'm not one of those people that raged because dual spec got lowered in level/cost. I thought it was cool, and it would give people more incentive to try out new specs. I didn't rage about the northrend flight being lowered even though I bought it on 6 of my 80s at 1k. I don't really get mad about stuff like that, it helps the game some. This kind of thing though is what blizz is developing. They seem to be making a community of people that just want things handed to them. <br />

<br />
Is it really raping Inscription for a quest giver to reward a player with three glyphs which are all weaker than their inscription-sourced counterparts?<br />
<br />
Example: a young lvl 25 Arms warrior is given a glyph by the quest giver; Lesser Sweeping Strikes, reduces the rage cost of Sweeping Strikes by 25 or 50% (as opposed to the full glyph which reduces by 100%).<br />
<br />
No player at level cap is going to keep the weaker one and not take the 100%, however it does allow new players to get some glyphs without spending the money they might be saving to get flying or something.</div></div><hr />

I take it you play on a server where Glyphs aren't 250g a piece. I can understand the suggestion of giving lowbies one of the many useless weak glyphs that are offered to players through inscritption, for every class there is literally a handful that are useful and many many many useless glyphs that no one in their right mind would bother purchasing. Is giving lowbies one of those really going to hurt your profession? No, stop crying.</div></div><hr />

^This. If anything it might actually increase overall glyph sales. New player gets his free weak glyph and reads that more powerful ones can be made by other players. New player wanders off to find out what glyphs he can get, or at least files the information away for later when he has more money. As it is, you could easily completely miss the glyph system until a more experienced player points it out to you or helps you. It's not particularly obvious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're really comparing handing out some beginner glyphs in a videogame to rape? Absolutely nothing will be negatively affected by a trainer handing out cheap starter glyphs.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've done the new quests, it isn't hard by any means to make money now on them. Level 30 and you are getting rewards worth 1g to vendor. This is just a clear case of I wants it noa, give it. I really can't stand that.<br />
<br />
You need to find something worth ranting about in life. If it's so easy to make money from quests, than you won't care about the lost income from people starting out with some glyphs. You're coming off like some of the worst stereotypes that play this game--the raging neckbeard who hates the filthy casuals wrecking his sense of videogame accomplishment.</div></div><hr />

Oh I'm so glad they fixed the Alliance version. However, I just recently leveled a Horde Shaman and it was messed up for them also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lihab</div><div class="date">2010-12-03, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I take it you play on a server where Glyphs aren't 250g a piece. I can understand the suggestion of giving lowbies one of the many useless weak glyphs that are offered to players through inscritption, for every class there is literally a handful that are useful and many many many useless glyphs that no one in their right mind would bother purchasing. Is giving lowbies one of those really going to hurt your profession? No, stop crying.<br />
<br />
How long have glyphs been that pricey on your server? is it all of them, or mostly just the glyphs affected by the new race/class combos (which, come to think of it, might be all classes?). Prices will be a little crazy for a few months because of the new combos and then again for goblin and worgen chars. After that, when people have filled up their little glyph books, prices will level out again. I dont think that giving away starter glyphs would completely break the inscription profession, but I do think inscription is in kind of a weird place at the moment.<br />
<br />
1) Its weird that a fairly major game play mechanic relies solely on player crafting (a comparable mechanic might be alchemy, since pots are so heavily used, but its not totally the same). Its almost like having to find crafters for talent points or spells. Kinda odd.<br />
<br />
2) I suppose you could compare glyphs to other craftable items that become permanent on the character, such as pets maybe, but craftable pets also sell for kind of a lot. But glyphs take up kind of a lot of herbs, similar to alchemy again, but pots are one use (i havent done a mats comparison on pots vs glyphs or anything, so i'm not saying its a 1:1 ratio or exactly the same).<br />
<br />
3) At the moment, glyphs and cards are all a scribe does, there isnt much diversity, and demand for glyphs I think will go down and cards are random so its very much a luck based thing how much money you will make off of cards. On the other hand, maybe people will be more inclined to buy a full set of glyphs; people are inclined to &quot;complete the set&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, like I said, I don't think it would break the game, but why give out the glyphs at all? Do we give out starter enchants? We get pots from quests, but alchemists can sell an infinite amount of pots. Is a level 30 character going to suffer greatly by not getting a glyph for all his glyph slots? Leveling 1-60 (and beyond) is SO FAST now that you can reach a level where you make decent gold pretty quickly. I don't know if this is so much about a bit of gold. At least for me, it just would seem like a weird precedent to set, but inscription is already kind of a weird profession.<br />
<br />
p.s. - I just remembered off hands and vellums for inscription. so before anyone is like &quot;UH! HELLO! you forgot these!&quot; i thought i would mention them. is there a market for these that i'm missing? i know vellums are used, but they dont seem to be much of a money generator (in my limited experience).</div></div><hr />

Vellums can now be purchased from the enchanting vendor. And there is only one type, no more separations by armor/weapon, or level.</div></div><hr />

stop raping the AH and the problem will be solved, theres no way a lvl 25 player is gonna be able to buy 3 glyphs at 80-150g a piece if they dont already have a high lvl toon that has some high lvl toon money on it. I just rolled a new toon on a different server, i'm lvl 26 and i've sold everything i've ever picked up that wasnt a quest item and i am an enchanter so i'm de'ing the items and selling the mats on the AH and i only have 24g...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My profession huh? I wasn't aware that engineers could make glyphs. <br />
<br />
What you are missing is that as time goes by people will acquire all of the glyphs they need. It's sad that I am having to explain this, but I will anyway. When the supply of something, exceeds the demand can you guess what happens? That's right the price will drop. People will want to sell the glyphs they have. With only needing to buy them once blizz has created a market where the supply is going to reach a point where there is no demand. <br />
<br />
On my server glyphs are around 30g each. If you are on a server where they are in the 100s then perhaps you should create an alt just for inscription and see how well it works for you. I doubt you would though. People complaining about glyph prices don't want to do any work. They want things handed to them for free. <br />
<br />
What if they also added in so that when you get your free set of glyphs you get a free set of blue gear to go with it. Would you be fine with that? Probably, but that's because you want the reward without putting any effort into it. <br />
<br />
To the suggestion, I would be fine if they offered a minor glyph for free. Offering prime, or major glyphs though would be wrong. They offer you an advantage, but not something you can't play the game without. It's similar to buying boe blue gear. You can play the game with quest gear, and dungeon gear. You don't need to go buy boe for every level. Some do it because they have the gold, it is a luxury. It isn't required though, and it will be outdated when you start running heroics. Just like when you start running heroics you will have gold to buy glyphs. <br />
<br />
There is absolutely nothing wrong with making people feel like they have to work for something. In fact I would say that the sense of &quot;give me everything for free&quot; is a huge problem, not only in WoW but in real life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think what you have to look at with an idea like that is that if the glyphs could be given as a quest reward theres no real problem. Afterall I don't see people complaining that they have a tailor/leatherworker/blacksmith and yet they are being hard done buy from people getting armour items from quests or loot drops.<br />
<br />
Overall the suggestion is a good one, especially for new players who dont know a great deal about the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The counterpoint to that is an analogy to the price of new tech gear. When you buy them early on (Comps, Blu-ray players, LED TVs), they are the newest bestest thing and you pay through the nose for them. Once they are replaced by the next newest bestest thing (310% flight in this case), or just flat out saturate the market, their value and cost drops through the floor. You pay more to get the benefit out of it earlier rather than waiting for the price to drop--but rest assured, it always does and always will. This does not change the community at all, because there will always be an expensive newest bestest thing to buy.<br />

<br />
If you had picked up mining as prof #2 and sold the ore you mined while leveling, you'd have well over 100g extra by level 26. (ore stacks of copper, tin, and iron routinely go for 3-10g each, silver can sell for 3-5g per ore) <br />
<br />
You can easily buy the glyph mats yourself and recruit a scribe in /trade to click a button 3 times for much less than 100g total cost. <br />
<br />
The game is what you make it.</div></div><hr />
