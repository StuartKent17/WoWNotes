Worgen and Goblin Heritage Armor Update<br />
Worgen &amp; Goblin Heritage Armor?<br />
I certainly hope we’re getting Worgen and Goblin Heritage sets in a future patch<br />
We are getting Worgen and Goblin Heritage armor questlines in a future content update.<br />
<br />
We think it’s really cool to have these memorable questing experiences that go along with and encapsulate the moment when you inherit your Heritage armor. We’re working on bringing them to the game as soon as we can.<br />

<br />
They're covering their assets and have the ability to say &quot;don't say we didn't warn you&quot; when the inevitable wave of players hit Twitch and complain about how long it takes to log in to Herod especially if the servers themselves are crashing on launch day from sheer volume to create this queue &gt; crash &gt; queue loop.<br />
<br />
If one intends to be a horde of Herod then expect some concessions where inconveniences will become features.</div></div><hr />

Lets say each server has 3 layers, that means 3x the normal population can get in. That also means player turnover is 3x higher than normal.</div></div><hr />

I think that's a good thing. Those who want English realm can go to one of new realms, leaving old realms those non-English communities.<br />
<br />
Its easy to change realm for guild and streamer now because everything is discussed in one place, not so easy for non-English communities that have multiple discussions on different forums/discord/reddit/whatever.</div></div><hr />

You think? I honestly got it at first to limit traffic, but now that they are opening new realms and begging people to go over... they should at least give everyone 1 extra name slot to help encourage the spreading out.</div></div><hr />

That makes no sense. You don't need more chars just because there are more realms. Pick one an play on it. If you switch, delete your old ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This one will too. I was just tossing out a suggestion that would help that realm fill up. 1 extra character with the proper name could be incentive enough to pack up and main there, for some people.</div></div><hr />

They can &quot;strongly urge&quot; all they like, players won't risk it. There are years and years of Retail examples where players went to less populated servers by Blizzard recommendation only to then be stuck on or forced to pay for a move.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't recall any questline regarding the heritage armors...<br />
<br />
Allied races I don't recall as having questlines, but the others that have gotten theirs so far had a questline leading up to the heritage armor reward. I only did the Tauren one so far but it was great.<br />

World PvP? Yeah, it didn't. Duels and BGs? Sure. That is entirely voluntary and optional, PvE servers are for hiding from PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You obviously didn't play on PvE servers, it happened all the time. NPCs are not immune to being killed so players would defend or kill them. Just an example, Horde would raid Goldshire.<br />
<br />
The only players who hid were lowbies getting ganked. Lest you think that shouldn't be and it's cool and hip to kill them.</div></div><hr />

I don't think being able to hide from PvP is how WoW should be, no. Just like War Mode was added for the people for whom social interaction is hard, PvE servers on Classic are for people who want to hide from it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. They made a huge mistake when they admitted they had the technology to increase the amount of players on the server. <br />
<br />
So what if it takes 4 months for them to cut layering out instead of 2 because the realm is higher pop? That's even assuming it has the massive falloff in players like they're expecting for them to even remove layering in the first place.<br />
<br />
If the server populations were such an issue, they should have been hard capped. If that means people who want to play with their friends have to switch to another server, again, so what? The servers aren't even live yet, they should have been hard capped until launch to prevent exactly the issue we're now seeing.</div></div><hr />

Following your line of logic, people who play on PvP servers are hiding from PvE. But we know this isn't the case, not for PvE nor PvP. Can a PvE player avoid having their questgiver killed? Absolutely not. The imperative is to defend the questgiver or fall behind in progression.<br />
<br />
Many PvP players will avoid ganking or killing players out of respect. If we follow your reasoning, again, then we can say most PvP players are hiding from PvP and are cowards? How about low level players who are hiding and running away, it makes them cowards for preserving their time from a clear loss?<br />
<br />
You actually believe there's no social interaction in PvE. You must be trolling or have a serious hateboner for PvE players. Looking over your other posts you actually believe that playing PvE servers removes &quot;50%&quot; of social interactions and gameplay. Truly, these PvE-dedicated players would continue to socialize and play as normal regardless of what's thrown at them.</div></div><hr />

I mean, maybe you're just not aware of what a PvE server is. It literally removes parts of the game. PvP servers are the full game, you'd have to be delusional to believe otherwise.<br />
<br />
No, what PvE servers remove in terms of pure content isn't much, but the social interactions and life of the world that results in is a different matter.<br />
<br />
Finally, nothing against PvE players at all, most are aware of why they choose what they choose.</div></div><hr />

The full game is whatever the person makes of it, since World PvP isn't the only aspect of PvP or the entire game.<br />
<br />
And those are pretty bold statements. But you're right, they're aware of why they chose to play PvE.

I know very well why: avoiding ganking is 99% of the reason. <br />
<br />
Maybe you don't know what literally means but PvE servers are objectively, literally, by definition not the full game. Being delusional about your server type choice is pretty sad.</div></div><hr />

Being ganked a lot while you play is not fun. Especially for people that don’t have the spare time they had 15 years ago. Fair battles are rare when you’re leveling and basically every time you hear the stealth sound near you, if it’s not a rogue from your faction, you’re dead 9 times on 10. The first times can be fun, after the 100th time you’re wondering why you’re paying for this.<br />
<br />
I played in a PvP realm since day one, I switched WM off when Blizzard introduced the stupid bonuses for alliance and I have to say having it off is not that bad at all.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying it is a lot of fun, I'm just saying that pretending that choosing PvE realms is more than just hiding from PvP (ganking is PvP) is delusional.<br />
<br />
That said, I've played the game a lot over the years, and I've been ganked far less than I've had winnable fights. I played on a PvE server for a while (a year+) because my GF did when I met her, but we both agreed eventually that it was a lot less interesting.</div></div><hr />

You're the one claiming PvP doesn't exist in PvE servers and therefore it's not a full game while it's not true. It's pure posturing with sentiments of grandeur because you chose a PvP server, pretending to understand why others don't want to be ganked. Even PvP player priorities will vary to the extent that many will avoid killing others (especially lowbies). Despite you holding on to your assertions, these player-made choices contradict your opinion of what constitutes a &quot;full game&quot; - that's the definition of delusional.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Social is the only difference between PvP and PvE servers, really. PvE servers still let you flag yourself for pvp via a console command. PvP servers are just PvE servers that flag you automatically when you zone in to certain zones. Technically it means it's PvP servers that offer less choice between the two.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure I played on a PvE server back in Vanilla, and Tarren Mill battles were long and numerous.<br />
<br />
So you PvP when you want to, and turn it off when you don't, it's called preferences.<br />
<br />
And I'm pretty sure you have no clue what the word literally means, literally.</div></div><hr />

Like being ganked or not... you just have to understand that a lot of people dont care at all about any kind of pvp content. If you think that they miss a part of what make Wow a full game experience, good for you! I'm probably sure that you don't care about some features in the game too. You can play the game and avoid some features, so YOU can play the game the way you want, doing want you want! But there's no way to avoid pvp if all servers are pvp. PVP IS a feature like any others.</div></div><hr />

Well, if you're offended enough to imply something you think would insult me if you believed, how about you try to enlighten me on the reasons to choose a PvE realm other than hiding from ganking.</div></div><hr />

You seem to like throwing around words you obviously don't know the meaning of, such as &quot;offended&quot;. Also you chose to take it as an insult when it was meant more as an insert of a personal view on the situation based on what you've been saying until now, and that's not really my problem. <br />
<br />
Also what is there to prove, when you've already proven in this comment chain that you refuse to listen?</div></div><hr />

Chose to take it as an insult, lol.<br />
<br />
So there isn't anything else, then? Nobody else has said there are other reasons, just that PvE-server players aren't cowards for choosing to avoid ganking.</div></div><hr />
