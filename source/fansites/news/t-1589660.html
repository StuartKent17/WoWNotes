With Warlords of Draenor set to launch on Thursday, November 13, we’ve seen a few questions about how that fits in with our plans for the upcoming 10-year anniversary content. We’re looking forward to celebrating this epic milestone with you, and we want to make sure everyone has plenty of opportunity to take part while still being able to fully enjoy what the expansion has to offer.<br />
<br />
The 10-year anniversary celebration will begin in-game on Friday, November 21 and will last until Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 10 a.m. PST. Everyone who logs in during this time period will receive the incredibly cuddly, feisty, and fiery new Molten Corgi to love, pet, and call their own. You’ll also be able to participate in a pair of special events to commemorate the occasion.<br />
<br />
Maximum Molten Core<br />
One of WoW’s classic 40-player dungeons, Molten Core, will be available in Raid Finder during the anniversary period for level 100 players. Making it through the underground gauntlet and defeating Ragnaros will reward players with a Core Hound mount and a Warlords of Draenor Raid Finder–quality helm (100% guaranteed!). For a walkthrough of the dungeon as it stands today, check out our Revisiting Heroism’s Past – Molten Core guide.<br />

Southshore vs. Tarren Mill—The Battle Continues<br />
To recapture the feeling of the endless tug-of-war of early WoW PvP, we’ll be opening a Team Deathmatch–style Battleground based on the timeless struggle between Southshore and Tarren Mill. We’ll have two different brackets for players to take part in: one for levels 90–99 characters and another for level 100. Unlike the old days of Tarren Mill vs. Southshore, there will be a clearly defined victor, so you’ll need to work as a team or face crushing defeat. A win will gain you a shiny new title: either Tarren Mill Terror for the Alliance or Southshore Slayer for the Horde.<br />

<br />
Onward into Warlords of Draenor<br />
With the release of Warlords of Draenor, all unrated PvP Battlegrounds, Skirmishes, and other unrated PvP activities will be available immediately. The new rated season will begin Tuesday, December 2 at 8 a.m. PST.<br />
<br />
We also wanted to make sure that everyone had time to level up before we opened our first Raid dungeon, Highmaul, in Normal and Heroic modes. These will open at the same time as the rated PvP season (December 2), with Raid Finder and Mythic modes opening the following week. We’ll provide a complete schedule in the future for those who wish to start planning their new Raid calendars. For more information on the new Raid structure for Warlords of Draenor, be sure to read our Dev Watercooler series: Raiding Azeroth – Part 1 (http://us.battle.net/wow/en-us/blog/13929586), Part 2 (http://us.battle.net/wow/en-us/blog/13935559), and Part 3 (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/13942448).</div></div><hr />

They only make official announcement on dates when they're finalized. The start of the anniversary was set, the end was something they were trying to decide on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably because in it's current form the game is about as appealing as watching a cow take a shit. I log on 1 night a week to raid and even that is painful.<br />
<br />
Thank god for beta keys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well it would probably entice some people anyways to come back earlier and mildly improve the status quo of those around. Assuming they are interested anyways.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd have considered re-subbing a bit sooner if the anniversary stuff was also starting a bit soon, but it looks like I will be hanging tight until a week or less before launch.</div></div><hr />

Getting to 100 takes about 12 hours. Try &lt;1hr a day.</div></div><hr />

Would give us something &quot;new&quot; and I think to have the anniversary one week after the WoD release, when they just released a ton of new content, isn't the best decision.</div></div><hr />

Well, still lots of number tuning for lvl 100 to be done, but yeah, I don't think there is much left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea they said when they did the trailer release that 6.0 patch should be available 1 month before WoD drops. So My guess is either<br />
<br />
Oct 7th <br />
or<br />
Oct 14th</div></div><hr />

I did it in 11 and a half hours after the increase, not going for insane efficiency either. You just...do the fucking quests, and you level pretty quickly. It's not rocket science.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, this I would really like to see, &quot;about 12 hours&quot;. How much &quot;about&quot; we talking? Plus/Minus 12 hours? The 12 hours is not in a row, you've made that clear with your &quot;&lt;1 hour a day&quot; comment. want to see you level to 100, playing less than an hour a day for 12 days (lets say not consecutively of course, wouldn't want to put undo pressure).<br />
<br />
I'm not going to come right out and say it's impossible, cause then someone is going to go all forum ninja psycho about how they're totally gonna do it, but I highly suspect your perception of time is a little off. or a lot. :)<br />
<br />
If we said you could get a level, on average, every 2 hours, that would be 20 hours. But for most, it will be closer to 3 or 4 hours, especially in the 96 - 100 range. I'm talking the average player here, not the elite Beta player or the Min/Max'er or any of those, or Tanks or Healers. The average DPS'er. He's not knocking out 10 levels in &quot;about 12 hours&quot;. No, ain't happening.</div></div><hr />

the lore part sounds good, and i love me some warcraft 2 lore, but i just dunno if its worth the time anymore. the garrisons don't sound like fun, just more gated content.<br />

Meh..c'mon guys...all this stuff in there and now you desperately find sth else to complain about? Really? What is next? If pets and mounts and the helm are 100% will you say &quot;Oh..the bother to first clear the place with 39 strangers&quot;?<br />
<br />
They're not talking about the Corgi, so what part is it that is unclear to YOU? They're talking about Hatespark and Mini Hogger. Try to know what you're talking about before you try to sound like King Post Reader.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Making it through the underground gauntlet and defeating Ragnaros will reward players with a Core Hound mount and a Warlords of Draenor Raid Finder–quality helm (100% guaranteed!)<br />
That sounds like only 1 boss in that version of the instance and there will be an actual gauntlet before Ragnaros. Maybe it will be akin to &quot;Troves of the Thunder King&quot; scenario with tons of traps, interactive stuff and interesting mechanics? That would be awesome.</div></div><hr />

According to my English Vocabulary [I'm not english so yes, i use a vocabulary] &quot;complain&quot; means: lament, whine, ect... So where is the &quot;lament or whine&quot; when I ask if the Hog pet is confirmed or when I express concern about an &quot;unknown&quot; drop rate of a &quot;non confirmed yet&quot; pet? :DD<br />
<br />
My English is terrible, but I dont complain about nothing... I'm just one of the many pet collector's in frenzy for information!!! :D</div></div><hr />

As i remember back that time, most people are only allowed in these spec:<br />
Warriors: Protection, Arms(one only for -50% healing)<br />
Priest: Holy<br />
Druid: Restoration<br />
Hunter: Marksman/survival (as long as you can pull the mob)<br />
Paladin: either, better as holy (the only task you can do is buffing the team every 5 mins)<br />
Shaman: better restro (you are expect to put down totem as soon as they expired)<br />
Rogue: I can't remember for this one, the one come with us seems to be combat unless he's going into traps of BWL)<br />
Mage: Frost (the mobs are immune to fire, the most damaging spec of that old day)<br />
warlock: affliction, while warlock is not very popular on the old raid time (please keep debuff everytime, and more dots! c'mon more dots! when half of the raid is down)<br />
DKs: no dk back then, if there are, I would say frost.<br />
Monk: no monk back then if there are, I'm not sure which one, maybe mist? you can dps with healing....the dream of every &quot;hybrid class&quot; on that time</div></div><hr />

So we only have about a month to ascend 10 Levels, then have to find a raid? How could we ascend 10 levels in a month?<br />

<br />
Actually we have seven weeks from November 14-Jan 6th. Also, asking that as if its some insane task is....dubious at best. You could easily get 10 levels in a month with not even an hour a night.</div></div><hr />

Hatespark the Tiny<br />
Drop: Ragnaros the Firelord<br />

1) Corgi ---&gt; for everyone who log during the event. And this is for sure. <br />

Considering you can go 90-100 in around 16 hrs, you are saying 60 days is not enough? you would literally have to play less than 15mins a day not to be able to hit cap in 2 months.<br />
