<br />
UBRS is awesome though.<br />
<br />
I'd take that any day of the week over Bloodmaul Slag Mines.<br />
<br />
Also the 6 we are getting are Auchindoun, Iron Docks, Skyreach, Everbloom, Bloodmaul and Shadowmoon Burial Grounds.<br />

Blue Post listed the dungeons we're getting just minutes ago, and apparently Everbloom was exchanged with Grimrail.<br />

WHY?!<br />
<br />
Swap Bloodmaul or Shadowmoon out. :( Those 2 suck.<br />
<br />
Although why they all aren't included is beyond me since there's only like 8 from that expansion. Would it really be too much effort to add UBRS and Everbloom?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">splatomat</div><div class="date">2019-02-06, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it's fitting that the expansion known for boring reskins would offer boring reskins as its timewalker mounts.<br />
<br />
More interesting mount options from Warlords: Kaliri, Firefly, Moth, Hydra, Crab, Stag. Spectral Anything. Something Iron Horde mechanical. Something draenei glowy would be cool as a reminder that there's an Alliance faction also. Something unique would be cool, though it might cut into all the things going to the shop. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I've just grown fatigued at what seems like the least possible effort for virtually everything. These people are professional artists and developers but they seem to have no imagination. sigh. oh well.</div></div><hr />
