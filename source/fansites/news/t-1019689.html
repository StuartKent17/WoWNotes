Bashiok announced the Season 10 ending date change of November 29 on Twitter (https://twitter.com/#!/Bashiok/status/134735242471813120) today, with the tag &quot;#indirectpatchreleasedateannouncements&quot;. <br />

<br />
Arena and Rated Battleground Season 10 is scheduled to end November 29. At that point we will determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards, a process that should take approximately one week. It's very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for Arena titles and/or the Ruthless Gladiator’s Twilight Drake to refrain from transferring their characters to another realm or faction until after Season 10 ends. During the break between seasons, all Rated Battleground and Arena matches will be unavailable.<br />
<br />
At the end of the season, Conquest Points will be converted to Honor Points, possibly exceeding the 4,000 point Honor cap. All Season 10 items will cost Honor Points (equivalent to their previous Conquest Point cost) when the season ends, with the exception of any items with rating requirements attached. These items will no longer be available for purchase.<br />
<br />
Please be aware that higher ilvl PvP items will be introduced and available for Honor points with patch 4.3.<br />
<br />
The next Arena and Rated Battleground season will begin for level-85 players approximately one week after the end of Season 10 and will coincide with the awarding of Season 10 titles and mounts. At that time, any Honor accrued above the 4,000-point cap will be converted into gold at a rate of 35 silver per point. In addition, Season 11 rewards will be made available for purchase with Conquest Points awarded during the new season. Matchmaking (MMR), Team, and Personal Ratings will all be wiped when Season 11 begins.<br />

Mastery raid buff<br />
C'mon now. The pointed sarcasm isn't necessary, and I think you may be missing what was actually said. This will not stand, y'know, this aggression will not stand, man. <br />
<br />
Still, it's probably best that I convey a clarification: <br />
<br />
What we said was that with the various changes we have made in 4.3 that tank balance is pretty close, and to be fair, it was also close in 4.2. Death knights in 4.2 may have arguably been harder to play well relative to other tanks, but they still tanked all of the content successfully, and some of our 4.3 changes are intended to ease the difficulty of tanking in that spec. The problems with block capping don’t at all mean “warriors and paladins are the best tanks.” That might be the case if we didn’t adjust things like DK armor, but we did. It might have meant that we would have to buff DK armor (or something) through all of the remaining 4.x raid tiers to keep up, but there are no more 4.x raid tiers. <br />
<br />
There are a more problems when one stat is too good aside from players with that stat simply becoming too powerful. When any one secondary stat is too good, then players understandably view any gear without that stat as “garbage.” DPS specs can stack hit / expertise to the cap and then focus on say haste, crit or mastery. Right now, plate tanks don’t have a lot of attractive stats after they have capped mastery, except for dodge and parry which also affect pushing hits off the table the same as mastery does. Dodge and parry aren’t even meaningfully different from each other, except for the (somewhat sophisticated) games you can play with trying to avoid diminishing returns. <br />
<br />
In 5.0, tanks will care about hit and expertise, because those will become survival stats: if your hits don’t connect, you won’t have the resources needed for some of your defensive abilities (the less critical ones like Shield Block, but not Shield Wall). That alone will make tank gearing a little more interesting. If we decrease the amount of block, or the value of a point of mastery, or add diminishing returns to block, then we can still make mastery a useful stat without it being the god stat. Heck, we’re probably in a place with tank balance today where we could reconsider having bonus Stamina or armor, which we stopped doing a couple of years ago because they were the previous god stats.<br />
<br />
But it should be evident from that wall of text, that we’re not talking about simple changes here. They are fairly extensive changes with a lot of risk. There is a risk players won’t get the memo and not understand that block capping either isn’t as good as it once was or isn’t viable at all. There is a risk that paladins and warriors go from being relatively balanced to too weak. There is a risk that in our noble attempts to fix them from being too weak (such as buffing their armor, health or cooldowns) that the might become too powerful. We’re signing up to take that risk in 5.0 when we have more time to iterate and collect feedback and massive class changes are more expected. <br />
<br />
We'd also like to make these really big changes in a context where more players are likely to become aware of them - that's much easier to accomplish at the beginning of an expansion because most everyone is looking around to find out what's changed. Why would we do that? It might surprise you (since you guys are, by definition, the posting community) to know how few players actually participate in these forums or can even be reached by blue posts. Many players simply stumble upon changes, or worse, get yelled at by other players for not being up-to-date on the latest class changes, and get frustrated -- which isn't great for anyone's experience.

Battle.net Mobile Authenticator – Java Version Support Update<br />
In the weeks ahead, we will be discontinuing the Java-based (J2ME) versions of the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator currently available for download at http://mobile.blizzard.com. This includes versions of the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator for mobile devices like the Motorola RAZR, Nokia's Series 40, and other &quot;non-smartphones.&quot;<br />
<br />
The iPhone®, Android™, and Windows® Phone 7 versions of the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator are not affected by this, and will continue to be supported and available at https://us.battle.net/account/support/mobile-auth-download.html.<br />
<br />
Any Battle.net Mobile Authenticators previously downloaded from http://mobile.blizzard.com will still continue to function, as will the version available through BlackBerry® AppWorld™. However, we will not be providing further updates after December 13, 2011, and that will also be the last day these versions will be available for download from http://mobile.blizzard.com. The downloadable ringtones and wallpapers available at this site will also be discontinued, but we’re looking into ways to offer them as free downloads from our community websites in the future.<br />
<br />
For more information on the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator, please refer to the FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;tag=BLIZZARDAUTH&amp;rhtml=true).

Stampede<br />
I just reviewed yesterday's Q&amp;A, and came away with a follow-up question that I then posted to the devs privately. The question submitted yesterday was &quot;&quot;Have you considered having a pet stampede spell where our 5 pet stable rushes our enemy for a 5min cooldown? Or is that too epic?&quot;<br />
<br />
The response was &quot;yes&quot;, but there were two questions there, and we didn't make it clear that we were responding to the first question. Here is a Ghostcrawler quote for you --<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the potential ideas we're considering for a new hunter ability is one where they send all 5 of their current pets to attack, for a short period of time, on a long cooldown. No guarantees that we'll go with it, but we're at least considering something like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
With Aspect of the Cheetah on you won't get dazed when attacked, but the speed bonus will be turned off when you get hit.<br />
<br />
It isn't a certainty, but it is very likely that this will be implemented with 5.0. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/205873/stampede) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3566007927))<br />

Improved Soul Fire<br />
As part of the buff consolidation plan, Improved Soul Fire is no longer a part of the 5.0 Destruction Warlock. The damage gained from the buff has been rolled into the Infernal Ember mechanic.<br />
<br />
We’re trying to improve the quality of life for this spec, and removing Improved Soul Fire seemed like a good place to start.(Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/205760/congrats-seriously-read) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3566007110?page=1#18))<br />

Spellsteal as a Dispel<br />
Spellsteal will likely count as a dispel in this model and will have a cooldown. However, it's likely to be the longest cooldown of the dispels, to offset its spell stealing mechanic. And, it's likely to dispel all applicable effects from the target, but only give the mage one of them. That's definitely not set in stone, by any stretch, and we'd love feedback on that.<br />
<br />
What's that, GC? But I didn't... I was only trying to... OH GOD. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/205765/apparently-spellsteal-has-a-cooldown) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3566007158?page=7#140))<br />

Wasting 5-6 gcd just to get rid off all the opponents buffs at the cost of huge mana is very inefficient.The new model of SS is going to be great because despite the long cd of ss, it's being made into something more simplistic to use. Fire and Forget. Remove all opponent's buff and get one that is the &quot;Best&quot; buff based on some internal model.A 1min cd is just about right for such a spell.Besides I never found it exciting to be stealing buffs that can be easily rebuffable by opponents.</div></div><hr />

Huh? Patch comes 1-3 weeks after season ends, not when it ends. Next patch comes in December!<br />

Those saying that it can't here is some history Season 9 ended on June 28, 2011, and patch 4.2 dropped the next day. Season 10 didn't start until the next week, and with the whole honor problem being used on inferior gear. When season 8 ended it was the same day that patch 4.0.1 dropped. With season 9 not starting until Cata launched. Then back in Wrath on 4/14/09 the Ulduar patch dropped (3.1.0) with the ending of season 5. Season 6 didn't start until the next week. So, it is not definite that the 29th would be when the patch drops, but it can't be ruled out.</div></div><hr />

How would it be the best if it had the longest cooldown and if you have a bunch of buffs that can be dispelled then the mage would likely get one of the less useful ones. Don't say anything about throwing love at mages, have you even looked at their example talent tree?</div></div><hr />

are you dumb? it will have the longest cd of all dispells and the mage will get a random buff out of however many he dispells, as of right now we could dispell multiple buffs and gain them all within seconds...this is going to be a huge nerf, you are an illiterate little whiny girl...</div></div><hr />

Yes I have so far they have some of the best talents showcased @ blizzcon double ploymorhp anyone ? dragons breath for everyone! yay for frost mages who need the extra cc(coldsnap for everyone as well).

&quot;At the end of the season, Conquest Points will be converted to Honor Points, possibly exceeding the 4,000 point Honor cap. All Season 10 items will cost Honor Points (equivalent to their previous Conquest Point cost) when the season ends, with the exception of any items with rating requirements attached. These items will no longer be available for purchase.&quot;<br />

Sometimes the ignorance or inability to read completely shocks me. Patch and end of the season will be on the same day. If they weren't the &quot;Sell back policy&quot; is completely useless.

They accomplished that with mastery. Now they are saying they don't want block capping. 1) They just decelared their success a failure 2)Everyone saw the posssibility of the block cap the moment they said that. There were new level 85 102.4% macros popping up on mmo before beta even came out. I hardly think that was lost on every developer, but they still went forward with it and acted suprised.Tanks needing hit and expertise? I think they lost concept of what a tank is. Tanks are not dps. Tanks stop damage, not deal it, and to base defense on hitting the target is weird. Not to mention, especially in the case of the plate tanks, there are already 3 different dps rolling on the same gear, now you add 3 tanks to that for 6 total specs on the same gear? I hope the tank hit and expertise gear is significantly different than the dps hit and expertise gear. While I see the value in what they are trying to do with active mitigation I don't agree with the direction they are taking with tanks.</div></div><hr />

Look at the top of the arena ladders. Mage Lock Shaman is currently the most OP comp. Mages and Warlocks are currently the top two classes in representation (might be rivaled by shaman, but that's because they're resto.) Mages are able to almost (and sometimes succeed) global people at times. And this is with 4k resil at 2200+</div></div><hr />

The vulgar posts might have gotten somewhat out of hand, but the PvPers have every right to complain. Blizz actually ruined ALL competitive spirit last season with the change of MMR/rating gain. They shafted PvPers with balance changes, but we we've accepted that. But if they didn't change MMr, everyone that got an extremely inflated rating in season 9, and kept it in season 10, would also get gladiator in season 11 by just farming like 20 games to 2900 and camping the rating. Now that they are clearing MMR, the competitive aspect will be back, and the balance issues aren't all that horrible. <br />
<br />

I would think people at Curse would have a better understanding of modding than that. They're giving one month max to create and release these mods.<br />
Skyrim is brand new, and people haven't had the time to learn the ins and outs of how modding is even done for that game. And their standards for the mods are extremely high as well. Do they really not have any idea how long it takes to create a new quest, or region, or armor mesh+texture, or pretty much anything on that list? Many people would be pulling it close to the deadline releasing any of those things even for Oblivion, which people have been modding for years.<br />
<br />
And then you have to consider the fact that people have not even had a chance to actually play the goddamn game yet, and have no idea what is even in need of modding, or how they should go about doing it.</div></div><hr />
