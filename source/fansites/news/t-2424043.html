<br />
<br />
Grimmy<br />
<br />
For the next part, you'll need a Windwool Hood (https://www.wowdb.com/items/82397-windwool-hood), Deathsilk Shoulders (https://www.wowdb.com/items/54474-deathsilk-shoulders), Netherweave Tunic (https://www.wowdb.com/items/21855-netherweave-tunic), and Frostwoven Leggings (https://www.wowdb.com/items/41519-frostwoven-leggings).<br />
All of those items must be the Uncommon version, not the Rare.<br />
Next, head to vendors to purchase these items:<br />
<br />
Proximo's Rudius (https://www.wowdb.com/items/30569-proximos-rudius) - Sold by a vendor in Halaa<br />
Rough Wooden Staff (https://www.wowdb.com/items/1515-rough-wooden-staff) - Sold by vendors in major cities<br />
Punctured Pelt (https://www.wowdb.com/items/40360-punctured-pelt) - Sold by Aspen Grove Trader (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/29270-aspen-grove-trader). If hostile to you, you'll need to purchase from the Auction House or another character. <br />
Formula: Enchant Ring - Striking (https://www.wowdb.com/items/22535-formula-enchant-ring-striking)<br />
<br />
Once you have those items, head to Arathi Highlands at 85, 73 and click the Note on the table.<br />
After reading the note, put on the armor pieces you brought and talk to Grimmy. <br />
After talking to Grimmy, read the note next to him about his enemies. <br />
Head out and emote at Grimmy's enemies while you have the grey items in your inventory:<br />
<br />
Aquinastrasz (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/47121-aquinastrasz) - 28, 25 in Twilight Highlands, needs a /slap<br />
Karnum Marshweaver (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/36034-karnum-marshweaver) - 57, 47.6 in Desolace, needs a /wave<br />
Noggra (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/28792-noggra) - 40, 68.8 in Zul'drak needs a /cheer<br />
Stained Mug (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/62877-stained-mug) - 44, 90 in Kun-Lai Summit needs a /dance<br />
<br />
You can be sure these steps are complete with this macro: /script print(IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(52822),IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(52823),IsQuestFlaggedComplete d(52824),IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(52826))<br />
Next, you need to get 144 stacks of Potato from the potato in the field outside, at 88.38 69.21.<br />
Head back to Grimmy, use the new dialogue option, and head out back to open the chest for the Waist of Time (https://www.wowdb.com/items/162690-waist-of-time)<br />
<br />

<br />
I mean, I get the joke... it's a complete waste of time to do all the steps in order to obtain the [Waist of Time], but without the pendulum, it just isn't worth it no matter what anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was watching the discord for the final part, it was quite fun, people were watching a torch in the fire festival that would turn on and off every 5-10 seconds, and got a code they needed to find the order for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then someone just randomly got 144 stacks of potatos and found out thats all you needed, making us laugh that the other 9 other plants were useless.</div></div><hr />

Took us ages to start on the list of objects after Baa'l. Once there we pretty much pushed through using the The Warcraft Chronicle Vol.2 using lore clues with the Anagrams. Then we hit Gimmy, and well when we realised what the final solution was ... very simple, but DA HELL? :P I love the waist! It was amazing ride!<br />
<br />
There are plenty of secrets out there in Legion &amp; Battle for Azeroth left to be solved! And some mounts that have not been uncovered, as well as other items.<br />
<br />
Remember its the Journey, not the prize! &lt;3<br />

That was my reaction as well. I'm looking at all these steps and am just baffled as to how this can possibly be a logical series of events.</div></div><hr />

Do you know if there's a log somewhere detailing how each step was actually solved? Getting the items and following the discord is fun in itself but would really like to know how these clues were actually worked out.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bearlolzx</div><div class="date">2018-08-24, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the clues were worked out by datamining</div></div><hr />

There was simple 4-5 languages simultaneously working out which anagram worked for all languages. That gave clues, which people used to cache search certain areas until the next item in the series was found (as they had the same item id+1 compared to the previous one)</div></div><hr />

First many people thought that Baa'l was the end of the puzzle until people found the orb in Spires of Arakk, almost a day later. Same situation seems to be happening right now as well. People found some spells that seem to be related to the Waist on WoWHead and they've all headed back on the hunt.</div></div><hr />

The Chronicles book also helped with providing a direction for the guesses quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
when more than 20k people across all regions unite &gt; true hivemind appears :)<br />
People tried to ask from GMs, twit to Jeremy, etc etc, but in the end, we managed to guess first clue, while we guessed, another batch of people went checking etc etc. the second part of secret had a pattern, everything was about anagrams, but then we realised anagrams followed events in the Chronicles vol 2. We just had to check stuff, think about lore/locations, thats it.<br />
When you are alone, yeah, impossible to do.<br />
But when its you, motivation, adventure feeling, and more than thousand people... everything is possible. Secret solving team is a living example :D</div></div><hr />

The only thing we solved really were the anagrams, then we just searched around areas we thought it might be until the object popped up on our cache, and then it was just ok ...search around this area for Leafy Leaf or Tiny Frog, etc.<br />
<br />
When we got to Tiny Frog, most of us thought it was gonna be the Frog mount but alas it's not a thing yet I guess. <br />
<br />
Hivemind mount MAY make it into the game, Jeremy tweeted recently that he loved the idea but it just couldn't be added into launch in time, but may make it in sometime in the future. :D</div></div><hr />

Not only does this riddle require you to go to the hedge maze in the heart of Boralus and most of the steps to get Ba'al are in Kul Tiras, you also need to get an item only Alliance players can buy.</div></div><hr />

This whole &quot;chain&quot; is such a fucking time consumer traveling from one faraway place to another all the time. They have a big hard on this expansion on making everything take long time to complete. People gonna read it and spend hours doing it, these are additional hours they probably would've spent outside of the game if there was nothing else to do (and there isnt at the time - another big coincidence).</div></div><hr />

<br />
What item is that because if you are referring to the [Punctured Pelt] horde can buy it. My main is horde and did all of it without the needs of the alliance.<br />

You just need someone nearby. There is likely someone doing at the same time, if not you can likely ask someone to help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beace</div><div class="date">2018-08-25, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The last few steps involving the potato is missing information in this news post. I looked up https://warcraft-secrets.com/guides/waist-of-time/ to see what I needed to do. Specifically: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Return back to Grimmy and he should have new dialogue.<br />
<br />
I’ve sent some messages to your enemies, now about those secrets…<br />
<br />
Oh, that is excellent. But still, I… er… hm.<br />
<br />
After speaking to Grimmy, a new note appears! The note is by the fireplace, in the same room as Grimmy. It’s Grimmy’s “favorite recipe”.<br />
<br />
A pinch of tumeric and a pound of salt, if it comes out poorly it’s your own fault.<br />
<br />
Pay attention to the broth, and stir, stir, stir!<br />
Then add a big handful of board fur.<br />
<br />
Last you need a little sour,<br />
get the kick with a little gunpowder!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It was assumed that all of the rotten fruits and vegetables had a part to play within this secret, but in the end, there was only one that was really relevant.<br />
/way 88.38 69.21 Potato<br />
<br />
Get 144 stacks of the rotten potato debuff and go back into the house and speak to Grimmy. He will have a new dialogue option: “What’s that smell?” and you will get a 2 minute buff called Marked. Now, just go around the back of his house and there you will find a chest. Upon looting the chest, you will be rewarded with the Waist of Time.</div></div><hr />

There's a reason why that reward is a waist of time... Getting a unique mount wouldn't be a waste of time.</div></div><hr />
