yeah tell me pls ;) --- i play the best with my rogue, i had hard times to get 2.2k, which is not much... i know.

yay rogues with nothing. no wonder its the lowest played class now. boring boring boring. same ol for 9 years<br />
<br />
For those of us actually testing on PTR, Assassination needed a nerf.<br />
<br />
This entire expansion it's been a cointoss as to what the damage meter will look like at the top. Sometimes with some favorable procs I'll be at the top, sometimes I'll end up a little lower. And that's completely ok.<br />
<br />
What wasn't ok was being on PTR and blowing away every single person without as much as a second thought to what I was doing (As long as there wasn't some 'screw off, melee' mechanic). The buffs are nice, but they overdid it a little bit. I'd expect to see another round of nerfs to assassination before 5.4 release.</div></div><hr />

I'm fairly sure that since MoP release monk is the lowest played class, at least on EU and rogue's numbers still suprases shamans and warlocks: http://wow.realmpop.com/eu.html</div></div><hr />

yeah, you work here &gt;&gt;&gt; Blizzard :) yeah, i play with my rogue 8 years ago, and i masochist for sure. I was gladiator, achieve all things, and i hoped after this useless rogue times, blizzard will give back rogues.. but no, same happen again. Buff them in PTR, now its viable class, STILL NOT OP as Lock, Hunter, Druid, but viable. After the buff, comes the nerfs, and useless again. Only hope remains.. but its only a game, so i will sleep well. BUT BLIZZARD :mad: :mad: :cool::cool:</div></div><hr />

They consolidated the tooltips and are having Brewmasters doing the same damage as Windwalkers for the changed abilities. The changes should make Brewmasters more powerful with lower vengeance but less powerful with vengeance due to the poorer AP scaling. To be clear, this should have no effect on Windwalker monks.</div></div><hr />

Check my comment that is literally right above yours. It is neither a buff nor a nerf. They didn't change anything for Windwalkers.</div></div><hr />

Not really, no. I sleep well thx. And yeah, i like to play with my rouge. I achiev all things in arena, rbg or old times pvp. Last seasons some other class carry me, becuse i was nearly useless, thats a bad feeling when you know your class is very very underpowered. And when i read ptr, i have déjà vu . AS last times, in PTR rouge got buffs and they viable, and when hit live nerf back to 0. so facepalm , yeah facepalm :confused:<br />
<br />
if they nerf BACK AGAIN! :mad::mad: i will rename CARRYMEALOTAGAIN</div></div><hr />

What? Rogues are the by far best melee class, current ptr testing showed them about 20% ahead of the other melees. Rogues are still overpowered, just not that far anymore. Not it's only 15% more instead of 20%.<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
Rogues dominate melees on all kind of gear and skill levels in PVE. They do it already and after the 5.4 buffs (and nerfs for most others) rogues totally annihaleted all other melees, 15-20% ahead. Now it's still 11-16%.<br />
<br />
They are also the most wanted melee in raiding.<br />
<br />
PVP, well. They are in a good spot, all rogues together share 7% of all paylers above 2200 rating. No other melee has a higher represenatation in 3v3 2200+ rating.</div></div><hr />

Quick clarification: the datamined changes you're seeing to Windwalker/Brewmaster abilities are simply tooltip fixes. The actual abilities have functioned this way for a while.<br />
