Patch 6.2 Hotfixes - July 7<br />
Garrison<br />
Ships<br />
<br />
Pandaren Crew (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/abilities/294-pandaren-crew) now increases success chance on naval missions that last more than 18 hours (was &gt;1 day) and the degree of this success increase is now greater than a Human Crew (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/abilities/292-human-crew) or Undead Crew (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/abilities/293-undead-crew).<br />
<br />
Naval Missions<br />
<br />
Oil Rig: Pickup Location (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/missions/745-oil-rig-pickup-location) should no longer require players to complete the wrong blockade mission.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
Hellfire Citadel<br />
Hellfire Assault<br />
<br />
Adjusted scaling to reduce the amount of health by roughly 10% on some Hellfire Reinforcements and some Felfire-Imbued Siege Vehicles for a 10-player raid on Heroic difficulty. Health should remain the same as before for raids with 30 players.<br />
<br />
Hellfire Reinforcements: Contracted Engineer, Gorebound Felcasters, Iron Dragoon, Hulking Berserker<br />
Felfire-Imbued Siege Vehicles: Felfire Artillery, Felfire Crusher, Felfire Demolisher, Felfire Flamebelcher<br />
<br />
Mannoroth<br />
<br />
Mannoroth should now have a chance to target Hunters with Shadowforce.<br />
Mannoroth should no longer use Shadowforce on players already affected by Mark of Doom.<br />
<br />
Archimonde<br />
<br />
Doomfire now persists for 120 seconds (up from 90).<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Ashran<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where players that have died during an event may sometimes not receive quest credit after their faction wins the event.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Hunter's Seeking Crystal (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128502-hunters-seeking-crystal) and Master Hunter's Seeking Crystal (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128503-master-hunters-seeking-crystal) no longer seeks out Varyx the Damned.<br />
<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
Ironsides (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10165-ironsides): Alliance characters should now be able to obtain credit for upgrading a transport to Epic quality and complete the achievement.<br />

Blizzcon 2015 - North American Arena Qualifiers<br />
GCDTV (http://www.twitch.tv/gcdtv) is holding the North American Blizzcon arena qualifier rounds in July and August to determine which teams will be going to Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/july/arenaQualifiers.jpg (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/19816940/road-to-blizzcon-wow-north-american-arena-qualifiers-7-1-2015) <br />
<br />
<br />
PvP Gear and Champion's Strongbox<br />
All that being said, we agree that it’s not ideal for the only methods of earning that gear to be Ashran or Rated BGs. I can’t make any promises, but we’re exploring some options to make it available through other forms of PvP. Just keep in mind that we do want there to be some extra incentive to participate in RBGs and Ashran.<br />
To follow up on this, we're planning to allow the Champion's Strongbox (http://www.wowdb.com/items/126920-champions-strongbox) to be purchased from Conquest vendors for 1500 Conquest Points once a player has earned the Wild Conquest (27k) achievement. It will be added to the vendors in an upcoming hotfix.<br />
<br />
Even with Strongboxes being purchasable, it still includes RNG which is what people are opposed to. Are you even listening to us??<br />
Believe me, I completely understand how frustrating it is to get the &quot;wrong&quot; item. I've gotten two pairs of Vers/Mastery pants from Ashran. Would I have liked to get something else this week? Absolutely. But I also know that, especially this early on, being 1 item behind (at worst) someone else isn't going to have much of an effect on my standings at the end of the season.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, we'd love to find a system that brings all the benefits of RNG gearing (which I talked about earlier in the thread) but doesn't have the frustration of duplicate items or the fear of never getting your best pieces. Buying pieces directly for Conquest points is not that system. We'll continue to look into other options, though.<br />

hey, i am getting only two stacks of Elusive Brew with my 2hand weapon on my brewmaster. Is it an intended changed ?<br />
Nothing changed here. You likely switched to a fast 2H weapon. You only get guaranteed 3 stacks with a 3.6-speed weapon. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616054077034663936))<br />

Is it intentional that Mind Flay doesnt proc Prophecy Of Fear AOE but Arcane Missles does?<br />
Yes because Mind Flay is a damage-over-time ability. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616361542439714816))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
The change to Fragment of Dark Star (http://www.wowdb.com/items/124522-fragment-of-the-dark-star?bonusIDs=566) is additive or multiplicative? (25% or 41%) final effect.<br />
Multiplicative. It’d be 25% at Heroic ilvl. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616053898994782208))<br />
<br />
- Hunter's Seeking Crystal goes on cooldown even if it fails to teleport you to a rare, intended or oversight?<br />
This is intended. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616054656112824320))<br />
<br />
w/ caches now not giving &quot;next difficulty&quot; gear after X kills, wont they become obsolete as we gear up through the tier?<br />
Better for raiding to make mission rewards obsolete, than for missions to make raiding rewards obsolete. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616054736425320448))<br />
<br />
Will the Throbbing Blood Orb be a toy too when the mini-patch that turns the Cursed Feather of Ikzan into one?<br />
Yes. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616334857963081728))<br />
<br />
What is the reason behind the 50% nerf of Discordant Chorus' proc? It's already weaker than Empty Drinking Horn.<br />
You might be comparing them to unfavorable situations, such as on a single-target. Fel Cleave was quite powerful. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616364192933679104))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
How does Supreme Lord Kazzak ilvl loot work? Is it based on your progression in HFC or just a tooltip error in journal?<br />
This is a dungeon journal bug and will be corrected in a future patch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616350160482799616))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
any plans to fix ashram queue spending half my day in a queue isn't fun<br />
The queue is a big problem. We acknowledge that. Fixing it is difficult. We are working on options. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/616309716327788544))<br />
<br />
Will the class trinkets from HfC work in PvP?<br />
They do not work in rated PvP. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616333181713690624))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
What are voidwalkers? Are they void-corrupted spirits like voidwraiths?<br />
Not defined, atm. Maybe someday we will visit the cool-ass void dimension (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/616133464606273537))<br />
<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
Why do we have to do one apexis daily, to come back &amp; pick up 2 more? Why not offer them in one go? Clarification?<br />
The initial quest gives the most reputation; the follow-ups are there for those who want to invest more time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616372336946626560))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
What happened to the Garrison Mage Tower in 6.2? The Amperial Construct have gone all buggy and doesn't work 100% of the time<br />
(1) There was a bug where players would fall through the world, so some pathing logic was added. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616349581656195072))<br />
(2) This isn’t an ideal solution, so Amperial Construct will teleport you instantly in a small future patch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/616349642389762048))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Developer Communication<br />
What are the lessons learned under the one voice of &amp; multiple voice of now? How to improve going forward? #WarlordsQA<br />
I think multiple voices are always better but one is better than none. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/609819087758163968))<br />
<br />
Remember when he basically told the player base they had to play better? Or nerfing paladins to the ground?<br />
To be clear, I did encourage players to take dungeon strategy more seriously. That wasn't sarcasm. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610131110341677056))<br />
If you refer to the origin of the &quot;to the ground&quot; meme I was apologizing to players for not announcing a nerf. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610131404156829696))<br />
And I hadn't announced the nerf because I was on vacation. I wrote &quot;to the ground&quot; at a vineyard. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610131597086449664))<br />
Anyway, extreme sarcasm is probably a defense mechanism of mine. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610132914718662656))<br />
But I like that sarcasm helps convey that I don't take myself too seriously. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610133072516808705))<br />
It's rough on non-English speakers though. Chinese journalists had me raise my hand when I was being sarcastic. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610133245133369344))<br />
Because for them this shit is SO FREAKING SERIOUS. They forget that even great games are activities of leisure. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610133994559029248))<br />
For me, most importantly, multiplayer games are about hanging out with friends. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610134193717153792))<br />
<br />
Sure, not all players would vote, but a good bunch would, which should be very valuable data on said subject.<br />
A public poll has many problems but targeted queries can be very effective. We use them. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/609819384450711553))<br />
Curious what kind of problems. I think that presetting the proper expectations for it to the players would solve most of them<br />
It's not a random sampling, potential for influence, potential for fraud off the top of my head. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/610203607099510784))<br />
<br />
Game Design<br />
Players micromanaging dev teams is obv silly. But concerns over individual leads seem... less silly.<br />
It's still really hard for players on the outside to reverse engineer which lead led to which change. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/609515091281645568))<br />
That's why I always advise players to just stick with the change itself. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/609515158734438400))<br />

<br />
Different people are different. I for example was happy when GC was still around and explained stuff (he hinted in previous tweets tho that the company policy changed and he wasn't allowed to talk to players as much as he would have liked any more).<br />
I wasn't a fan of every design decision, but GC wasn't the only guy deciding things anyways, like Ion Hazzi... + Holinka are not the only people making decisions now. But GC talked a lot to the players and tried to explain the background of things and what they were thinking. The WoW team right now is awfully silent besides the occasional &quot;all is well, best game ever, but we should prune a bit more, players have still more than 1 button to push&quot; pep talk, but as GC hinted: that may be because of company policy and they're simply not allowed to do some real talk.<br />
<br />
Besides that I guess there are still enough people who hold a grudge against him (unreasonably so, in my opinion), but I guess there's little reason for them to bother tweeting him, less reason for him to reply to those tweets and even less reason for MMOC to put them on the front page.</div></div><hr />

I always thought Mind Flay is channeling spell like Arcane Missiles, any changes recently making it DoT?<br />
<br />
Arcane missiles:<br />
<br />
Launches five waves of Arcane Missiles at the enemy over 2 sec, causing (28.5% of Spell power) Arcane damage per wave.<br />
<br />
Mind Flay:<br />
<br />
Assault the target's mind with Shadow energy, causing (99% of Spell power) Shadow damage over 3 sec and slowing their movement speed by 50%.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, each wave from AM is its own damage, while dmg from MF is a chanelled dot.</div></div><hr />

Granted don't really need oil but oh well. Also, we do use personal loot for the first few weeks of a new raid. Eventually we will move it towards master looter if the raid leader feels like it.<br />
<br />
On another note, does anyone need Oil?<br />
<br />
Is it just me or am I the only one literally swimming in the stuff?</div></div><hr />

On my main, no. <br />
My main alt, that has barely stepped into Tanaan because of time issues and also ugh do I have to do this again? I'd rather read a book--is utterly starved for oil. I wish it were account bound. Same for apexis, and, well every currency, really. Some toons are capped on resources and others are starved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alts are always extra work, at least they are profitable in WoD! ;)<br />
<br />
But thanks, yes Alts without the work [Garrisons/Tanaan et al] do lack currency... but I think that's how it should be?</div></div><hr />

Yea, that's baaad. <br />
<br />
We used master loot for a week, then our RL went away on vacation and left me in charge of holding hands and stroking egos. <br />
The same day both of our tanks told me to go f myself and they'll be tanking when they feel like it. We are now using this new system, it's not mainstream, it's called &quot;zero-loot-for-everyone&quot;. <br />
I mean, really, how much loot do you need to have fun?</div></div><hr />

Like you said it, a channeled dot, still a channeling spell. usually dot spell is cast then it work by itself, no need to channel it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We used personal loot for the first two weeks to generate more tier etc., but now that we're filling in pieces we're back to group loot. I guess Master Loot is closest to that.</div></div><hr />

Not sure yet but the vast majority of missions are 18 hours or less now. Mostly just helps with the legendary quest line</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, bu they are different. Arcane missiles sends waves, each wave is like a single spell on their own, but you must channel to maintain it. Simply said, channel to send instant spells one after another.<br />
Mind flay is a dot which you must channel to maintain. Don't look at the channeling thing, but rather at the type of the spell. Waves of missiles =/= dot. Even tho it's channeled, it's still a dot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need two Pandaren crew to beat one expert captain.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind the expert captains only show up on the 4th and 5th missions.<br />
<br />

They're actually still fairly useless.</div></div><hr />

My plan was to finish the legendary missions and then never ever go near that dreadful thing again, so yay for me, that helps a lot.<br />
For everyone else pandaren will probably still be pretty useless</div></div><hr />
