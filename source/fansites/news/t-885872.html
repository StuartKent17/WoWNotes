<br />
Suggestion incoming:<br />
<br />
I couldn't get the tickets online as well last year. But the day that people had to go pick up the tickets from the convention center (the day prior to the first day of Blizzcon) I searched on Craigslist to see if anyone was selling tickets. Oddly enough, there where numerous people selling their tickets as they couldn't make the convention. And due to rules and regulations, they can't charge you more for the ticket then what they paid for online. They can, however, charge you for the swag bag. Running price for a bag was about $50 a bag. <br />
<br />
All I had to do was meet the guy in Anaheim on the night prior to Blizzcon. He went with his email confirmation that you he got, picked up the two tickets, and we did the exchange of funds for the tickets and swag bag that very night. Best advice though, do the transfer somewhere public, just for safety and what not.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for tickets and you can't get them online as they do sell stupid fast, search Craigslist the day they start handing out the tickets, do some research and talk to the person selling the tickets, and you should be good to go on getting yourself a ticket.</div></div><hr />

With current exchange rate: $40 = £24.47<br />
<br />
$175 is a stupid amount of money for tickets. I mean last year was really boring, as we knew almost everything about Cataclysm anyway. I'm not a SC2 player, so I can only assume they will blow us away with Diablo 3. I wont make the same mistake again.</div></div><hr />

Profit and loss mate. After making a few hundred million gross profit the last few years, these are just events to show off up and coming products. The problem is, they only show their own games, and as most of them are now retail .... what can they offer me for my $175?<br />
<br />
With E3 a week later, i know where my money will be going.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I thought at first. But thats why you must keep in contact with the person you are buying the tickets from. Make sure that the ad they put on Craigslist doesn't seem like it was put together by a 5th grader. Check for proper spelling and punctuation as well. Once you find an ad that you think may be legit, give the guy a call or email him. <br />
<br />
Most importantly, always to meet up in a public location and check the tickets to make sure they are authentic and you can't go wrong.<br />
<br />
A lot of people can't go because they start selling the tickets 5 months in advance, and its very hard to predict how your finical situation will be or if a family emergancy pops up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's going to be at the Anaheim convention center in Anaheim California again. I don't remember the dates though. I want to say around October 21st and 22nd. Not 100% sure on that.<br />
<br />
More than likely, it won't be in the east coast anytime soon. The cost to move everything from there location at Irvine to the east coast might make them lose a lot of money, that and they will have to charge more for the tickets to cover the cost to host the event on the east coast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol break even? on this singular even maybe, even still 20,000 dollars is like pocket lint to them.<br />
<br />
They gouge thier players everywhere else <br />
($25 for a figgin mount, ya know the things normally included in the $15 everyone normally pays. Or ridiculous amounts for character transfers? seriously it's like 10 clicks max for them and unimportant processing time. Optional? yes. ridiculous prices? oh so yes)<br />
<br />
My problem is that they seems to have picked a date always during the school year now (couple years back i think it was in August or something but not since). Yeah, forget people have other obligations, seriously (in theory) it hurts them more then us.<br />
<br />
It's like they keep the game barely running but do everything else in their power to screw with us (hold back dates, overcharge, make insane balance decisions, give less content in an expansion etc. BTW before you say &quot;don't like it quit&quot; Already did. I just keep up on it out of habit.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure that if the had an East Coast Blizzcon they would recoup all costs on tickets alone if done in as big a place as possible, there are a lot of us that can't go to California just to go to Blizzcon</div></div><hr />

Very true, but you have to think, there is also a lot of us that can't make it to the East coast to get to Blizzcon as well. <br />
<br />
No matter where they decide to host it, there will always be people that can't make it to that location no matter what.</div></div><hr />

I have to second this. &quot;Beep&quot; Blzcon, why always there? Ticket is not problem, but travelling is nailing me.<br />

<br />
Indeed, Blizzcon 2009 was very good - very promising, Cata sounded fantastic but to most it ended up being the catalyst to gamequit, alas. I wish it wasn't so, no one knew at the time. 2010 was amusing but it was dead compared to 2009, a few new developments but largely a huge rehash of the Blizzcon of the previous year. Bearing in mind the exodus taking place (it's true and you know it, I saw it on my realm(s) as did many others I spoke to and read on here and wow forums), this leaves a tantalising 2011. Blizzard will have to deliver. Will it be next expansion, where they will announce the biggest sweeping changes in the game ever seen (that should pull em back) or will it be the new MMO (doubt it, perhaps a teaser?), Diablo III - ok but..<br />
<br />
Cata took too long to come and when it came it didn't fulfill the appetites, especially given how long it took and how left we were hanging with ICC. If they announce the next expansion - which as I said will bring about the biggest changes seen in the game and should herald a true WOW 2.0, they can't then do the same for 2012 and make us wait too long, all this with the mindset that they have a new MMO coming. If it's purely a Diab 3 con - mass disappointment. Very intriguing to see what they do.<br />
<br />
I guess the new MMO will be announced, the expansion too (seems early given they have slowed down but they will have to show something in terms of progressing WoW other than a patch) and Blizzard will once again be a force to be reckoned with - this with a smattering/hint of DIII coming. Could be great. If they fail to deliver any WoW news or new MMO and only DIII - expect the worst.</div></div><hr />

You get to see a lot more for your $40 than you do for $175. You have 4 channels so you can watch all the halls, while someone who pays $175 can only sit in 1 hall and thus misses 3 other events happening at the same time. You have like 2 weeks to watch the replays so you can watch multiple times if you want to.<br />
<br />
And the best part you might ask? Well that is of course that you don't have to smell all the sweaty nerds stuffed into the halls...lol</div></div><hr />

Since I won't probably be able to make it out to California this year, anyone have past experiences on the DirectTv stream?<br />
<br />
Yea it was pretty good, you could watch every single panel you wanted as if you were there, and rewind and pause - and watch back a week after the event.<br />
<br />
The funniest part was when the Warcraft 3 commentator started talking shit about the players saying how crap they were, thinking the mic was turned off (as no-one was playing they were just playing random shots from the convention to pass time until the next game started). It went on for around 5 minutes until they got cut off. <br />
Really funny mistake, 5 minutes earlier she was saying &quot;what a fantastic game it was&quot; as soon as the mic is 'off' she starts talking shit :P</div></div><hr />

O_o 4.1 isn't even there. 4.2 will give us T12 in late summer. So 4.3 for sure won't be there in october, at least if it bring T13. Even if it's a minus content patch (like 4.1) it will be very short.</div></div><hr />

It's nice to raise money for the community, but being who they are they could have far reaching impact on other places around the world. They should already be supporting this cause in the first place without the dinner.<br />

<br />
For those that wonder why it's always in Anaheim: well, their headquarters is in Anaheim, and most (if not all) of the con staff are Blizzard employees. That's not to say that they couldn't hold one on the east coast, but they'd have to either hire a bunch of people to staff it, or fly their own employees out there.<br />
<br />
This one should be pretty big, though. Diablo III, next WoW expansion, possible SC II expansion, and maybe something on their next MMO.<br />
<br />
Heh. Also note that the benefit dinner tickets don't go on sale until *after* all the regular tickets will be sold out. It will be mighty tempting if I don't get a regular ticket. I wonder if I could con some people into chipping in on that for my birthday present. I mean, that would be a spiffy birthday dinner.</div></div><hr />

Dave drums for Tenacious D on the albums iirc. I know he does a lot of gigs with them. That's the only reason he was there, he's basically a member of the band. Satan in the pick of destiny was played by him actually lol. So yeah don't expect Foo Fighters probably. It would be like if Them Crooked Vultures were playing :P.

<br />
In addition you can fork out 500$ to join their charity dinner, where you will get another round of dodgy answers. I rather donate that money to Red Cross or any other charity, than having to hang out with a bunch of people who don't give a damn who you are and forget your name the moment they turn away.</div></div><hr />

WotLk were announced at the con right after release of TBC and Cata after Wotlk. Now its time for the next big thing.<br />
<br />
About the prices: yes they are high and people will buy it anyway. Blizzard knows that and why should they change it.<br />
Look alone at the virtual tickets. 40$ for a video stream for a weekend.<br />
10$ would still be expensive for something like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They stated that at the previous price they were losing around 20,000 dollars to host the event. Blizzard is not being greedy or selling out. They are trying to break even.<br />
<br />
So when did they break even? at 125$? 150$? 175$? Its still the same convention isn't it?<br />
<br />
In addition what about the 40$ tickets in order to be able to view blizzcon online, are those also to break even? <br />
<br />
And all the Merchandise that gets sold are those also to break even?<br />
<br />
They are a business and are in it for profit, and as long as people will keep buying those rare tickets prices might still go higher. Similarly to the TRH and Store pets.<br />
<br />
No Blizzard doesn't love you, you are not a special snowflake. You fanboys piss me off</div></div><hr />

Yea, Went to a friends house to watch some of it last year and it was crap. We ended up leaving to get some food and by the time we returned an hour later it was still up and down.<br />
<br />
Was not worth the $40 that's for sure. I'm just glad it was not my $40.<br />
<br />
To me this is the best reason to not buy tickets this year. I'm not sure who it was who said it but:<br />
<br />
<br />
$175? At $15 a month WoW is $180 a year. One event to go in and spend more money for more than the cost of playing the actual game for an entire year? i live 20 min away and still can't find a way to justify this. Not going.</div></div><hr />

Conventions are fun, sometimes. Traveling all that way, spending a small fortune on whatever, just not that much fun.<br />
<br />
The Livestream is the only way to go. I was able to put in a full day's work, go home, and pick and choose what I wanted to see. It works exactly like a DVR/Tivo, select the channel, the event, sit back and watch as many times as you want. Miss something? Rewind. And you also got the mini-pet, so it was well worth it. Outside of the people running around in RP gear, models in BE/Nelf outfits, people lacking in personal grooming habits, and the overprived hotdogs and cokes, you aren't missing a thing.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, it's a perfectly normal and safe thing to do. Particularly in the LA area I can say scalping/reselling tickets on craigslist is very common, in fact nearly anyone with a brain recommends this if for some reason at the last minute you can't make some event you bought tickets for and need to resell them or there's some event you want to go to but it's the last minute and you don't have tickets, seriously people do it all the time. It's called having a phone, talking to each other on it and then meeting in a public place. The only reason you should be worried is if the person does not want to meet in public.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They gouge thier players everywhere else <br />
($25 for a figgin mount, ya know the things normally included in the $15 everyone normally pays. Or ridiculous amounts for character transfers? seriously it's like 10 clicks max for them and unimportant processing time. Optional? yes. ridiculous prices? oh so yes)<br />
<br />
My problem is that they seems to have picked a date always during the school year now (couple years back i think it was in August or something but not since). Yeah, forget people have other obligations, seriously (in theory) it hurts them more then us.<br />
<br />
It's like they keep the game barely running but do everything else in their power to screw with us (hold back dates, overcharge, make insane balance decisions, give less content in an expansion etc. BTW before you say &quot;don't like it quit&quot; Already did.

<br />
They stated that at the previous price they were losing around 20,000 dollars to host the event. Blizzard is not being greedy or selling out. They are trying to break even.<br />
<br />
don't u think they are making enough money besides blizzcon to offer a fair price ?<br />
they prob make 20k every minute.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wolfpaq777</div><div class="date">2011-04-14, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Airfare for me (Washington Dulles to LAX on American Airlines) is running $779 each way round trip, plus tax, for a total of $1569. That times two so the hubby can go too and I'm looking at $3138 just to get there, before tickets, rental car, hotel, food, or anything else. Talk about ouch. Forget it.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to be rude, but where are you getting your flight prices?<br />
<br />
I just typed in a search at priceline.com for Dulles to SNA (the airport you would want to fly into - santa ana) round trip and there are a bunch of deals for &lt; $500 per person. Of course if you factor in hotel &amp; rental car price will probably jump up, but I could easily see you guys staying under $1500 total for flight, hotel &amp; rental car and food if you find a good package deal @priceline/kayak/expedia and don't eat $50 dinners each night.<br />

Who the hell would pay $175 for this...?<br />
<br />
People pay $400+ to see 1 lady gaga concert<br />
<br />
Lakers game 1 of the playoffs next week is already 90% sold out, only tickets left are $215 for crappy seats.<br />
<br />
$175 for 2 full days with demo play and tons of presentations is not bad at all when you look at other high profile events. Really not bad at all, especially if you're excited for D3 and there's a speculated chance at getting into beta with your ticket =P</div></div><hr />
