<br />
Strategy (Slightly outdated, will be updated in a few minutes)<br />
Health Points - 16.7M (25-Man) / ? (10-Man)<br />
<br />
The fight takes place in The Clash of Thunder, an arena overwatched by Thorim himself. As you enter the arena you will see a Jormungar Behemoth (~1.2M HP) fighting a captured alliance/horde (opposing faction) team composed of 1 tank, 1 healer, and 3 damage dealers. Killing them is fairly easy, just make sure you take care of the AoE healing from the healer while fighting the NPC and try to avoid the large poison breath while fighting the Jormungar. <br />
<br />
Once the NPCs and the Jormungar are dead, a lot of constructs (melee, casters, and healers) will jump into the arena from the stands and you will have to handle them with only one part of your raid while Thorim throws Stormhammers at them. He will also randomly activates the lightning orbs surrouding the arena, they will deal strong AoE damage to anyone near as soon as they are activated: run away from them! <br />
<br />
The 2nd part of the raid will have to go through the hallway to the left of the Arena and fight its way to Thorim. This hallways is also full of constructs and will also have you deal with two mini bosses (about 5M HP each), you only have 5 minutes to reach Thorim before he goes berserk and kills your raid.<br />
<br />
When Thorim is pulled by the hallway team, he will jump into the arena and the last part of the fight will begin. He's got 11M Health Points and hits a well geared tank for 8k damage but will also use two abilities: the first one is an Unbalancing Strike (http://thottbot.com/test/s62130) reducing the defense of the tank by 200 for 15 sec (100 for 6 seconds in normal). He will also casts Lightning Charge (http://thottbot.com/test/s62279) every 15 seconds, just like with Grull this effect will stack and Thorim will deal more and more damage during the fight. (Thanks to Wraith (http://wraith-guild.net/) for the help on the description of the fight)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elysium</div><div class="date">2009-03-17, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone know if there is a cooldown to Unbalancing Strike?<br />
<br />
Consdiering there is msot definatly 2 tanks during the fight. One in the hallway and one in the room. When THorim jumps down and starts being tanked.. is it possible for the OT to taunt for the duration of Unbalancing strike on the MT and they just keep taunting off each other or does he cast it so often that there is no point?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

So? Remove these news and you won't have more news on gameplays. No reason at all to whine. I also just ignore all that crap, as I don't want to ever really see it until I'm actually there in game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, you do actually read everything, everywhere, before playing a game, just so you can finish it really fast? No fun solving a puzzle by yourself?<br />
<br />
Like reading all the faqs avaiable for a Resident Evil game to know every boss, route, item locations &amp; puzzles, etc... just to repeat that on the game? Wouldn't be better to just watch a movie or even someone else playing the game, like ending cutscene on youtube, etc.? Weird...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Why fly a kite when I can watch a youtube video of someone else doing it? Different strokes for different folks, I don't think that's all that bizarre. Besides, just because you know what a boss does and how the fight should play out does not translate into an instant victory particularly when you are counting on 9 or 24 other people to help you out, some that might not have read up on the strategy. To pseudo-steal from GI Joe, knowing the strategy is merely half the battle.</div></div><hr />

If I was a company like Blizzard, well established now, in the entertainment market, I would try to surprise most of players and try to test new zones/bosses and games change with internal tests.<br />

Internal testing for a game like this is not feasible. Even Blizzard has limits to its resources, PTR testing is absolutely necessary. Really I fail to see the issue. Don't like spoilers? Don't go to strategy websites, or better yet, don't read the posts about the strategies on the strategy websites. Seems like a simple solution to me. It's churlish to suggest that because you don't like spoilers, no one should have access to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think you work for Blizzard and you can talk about what it is or not possible for them. Beside that you should check what's exactly mean spoilers. We are not taking a sneak peek about Ulduar, but we are seeing videos, pics, game changes, new items and where they drop and everything related with that.<br />
Basically we see everything new, before it released. Spoilers are a different thing.<br />
<br />
The only thing that you typed which I agree is that none ofc force me, however i do admit i'm curious, about game play changes, not about everything that will be released and especially how to fight them and defeat bosses cause i know strategies and abilities.</div></div><hr />
