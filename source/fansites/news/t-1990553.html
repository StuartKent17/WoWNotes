Holy Paladin Feedback -- Build 21570 -- 27-Apr<br />
A few various notes on the above:<br />
<br />
Tyr's Deliverance radius is reduced, but it will transfer through Beacon (either next build or the one after)<br />
Tyr's Deliverance will correctly partial tick on the final tick, so there are no haste breakpoints (other than the minor benefit of a full-strength buff still appearing from the final tick).<br />
It's been a while since anyone's had to seriously play around the downside of Blessing of Sacrifice, so proper tuning on it will be easier to see once tank tuning is in a more final place on alpha. The goal will be to tune it as a spell with a meaningful downside, so a shorter cooldown is the most likely buff, but we want to make sure the downside is at least reasonable.<br />
If an artifact trait is increasing the damage taken from 30% to 45%, that's a bug and is probably not helping with testing.<br />
Bestow Faith is buffed in the next build.<br />
Light of the Martyr and Aura of Sacrifice (heal replication) will no longer have their secondary effects increased when you heal a Guardian Druid or any other player with a general healing increase on them. <br />
The removal of Holy Bolt is largely offset by baseline buffs to Holy Shock in the next build.<br />
I corrected the Rule of Law post later in that thread it currently does affect Light of Dawn even though this is not 100% explicit from the tooltip. That's intended for now.<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll try giving Light of Dawn some hidden added targeting area around you (something like a small circle in addition to the cone), so that it hits everyone if you're in a clump, without worrying about who's precisely in front of you or behind you. Not enough to have to add visuals for it, just enough to feel like it's some overly generous targeting around the origin end of the cone.

Atonement Bug in Zones w/Legion Scaling Tech<br />
Just to catch up, since there have been various discussions and updates on the Disc class threads but not here:<br />
<br />
The bugs related to Legion scaling have been fixed as far as we know (and your data seems to bear that out, including in the case of Mindbenders). There is a clarity issue whereby damage increases, unless they've been specifically allowed, intentionally don't increase Atonement healing--and this makes the Atonement healing percentage appear smaller. That's what you're seeing here with the passive damage increase on the artifact (which does start at a small nonzero value even before traits are unlocked).

Pets and Pet Battles<br />
Even though I hate the change to Howl Bomb, it was SORELY needed and it will be much better for Pet Battle teams. Although one will over write the other on debuffs?<br />

Warcraft Movie Prequel Book Released<br />
The Official Movie Prequel book was released yesterday. It was written by Christie Golden and covers events leading up to the movie:<br />
<br />
In the world of Draenor, the strong and fiercely independent Frostwolf Clan are faced with increasingly harsh winters and thinning herds. When Gul’dan, a mysterious outsider, arrives in Frostfire Ridge offering word of new hunting lands, Durotan, the Clan’s chieftain, must make an impossible decision: abandon the territory, pride and traditions of his people, or lead them into the unknown.<br />

Doing Proving Grounds upto gold doesn't mean squat dude. It never meant anything at launch when you were fresh 100 either because it was so damn easy. Doing endless up to an amazing wave for sure but the 3 medals were easy to get. Also bear in mind there will be a learning curve for mythics at first in Legion with the whole new element of keystones.</div></div><hr />

For some classe/spec combos Silver Proving Grounds was harder than most heroics in WoD. That's the problem - the PG system was flawed by having the same test for multiple classes - not all classes are created equal. My MM hunter walked through silver at iLvl 595, arcane mage struggled to get through at iLvl 615.<br />
<br />
Yes - I could have just gone Frost to faceroll my way through, but that's not the point - I was going to be running heroics as Arcane, so I tried to use the system.<br />

I'd be curious to see the real percentage of players that have achieved anything with Proving Grounds. Too bad polls can't be done that require you vote through Battle.Net. If you don't have an achievement, it automatically stops you from selecting anything above what you have done while also automatically selecting the option that corresponds to your best achievement for that poll. Might finally get some honest polls with something like that and it'd also stop anyone who doesn't even play WoW from voting as well as those not currently playing (or at least haven't played the current expansion). Would certainly reveal how different the MMO-C audience really is from the actual player base if we could only vote based upon what we've really achieved rather than fudging the numbers.<br />
<br />
Polls are always a good laugh since so many just love to lie on them even if they're anonymous. Doesn't help when you can vote multiple times in the same poll, either.<br />

Wonder if the requirements for Proving Grounds will get removed with the pre-patch for WoD or if Blizzard will leave that as is because it will then be old content.</div></div><hr />

Just do LFD in a guild group if you must and pug the last player if needed or ask in trade or friends.

I can get gold - just not on the class I've been playing for 10 years, only on the class I'd been playing for 8 days.<br />

For one thing it much, much easier for certain classes and spec than others - it gave me a bit of bother on my affliction warlock but was a complete faceroll on a levelled-for-fun hunter. <br />
<br />
It was also a mostly unfun experience - casual players who couldn't pass it or found it difficult found it a poisonous experience on the whole (particularly if they weren't aware of the massive disparity of the challenge it represented to different classes). For those who found it easy it was just an annoyance, particularly when you had to do it on multiple chars<br />
<br />
Most of those who found it easy to do Gold+ are either better skilled than average or they have done it so often and on so many alts that they have it down to a fine art <br />
<br />
The majority of WoW players are average casual, and PG was something that proved nothing, was an unfun experience that could have been enough to induce players to just give up...and with the loss of over half it's subscribers, the last thing the game needs is unnecessary and unfun barriers to content.<br />
<br />
It was kind of like the Darkmoon minigames: you're either naturally very good at them, or you find them fun to do in which case you'll put in the time and practise to become good at them. Or if you're lucky, you'll be both<br />
<br />
But the average player doesn't have the natural skills to faceroll and probably doesn't have the time or inclination to get good at something like PG. Same as Mythic raiding, and they too tend to have the attitude that &quot;anything below Mythic is easy and if you find it hard you're bad&quot;</div></div><hr />

There's still Mythic+ modes for the &quot;I have PG endless 4000 on all my alts and you are all noobs&quot; elitists<br />

I raided MC, AQ and BWL on a mage. Healed Kara and SSC on a paladin. Pugged wrath on warrior, rogue, pally, mage and hunter. Skipped raiding in Cata because i was unsubbed and did LFR on 8 classes in MoP.</div></div><hr />

In practice, it was entirely unnecessary (superior gear was rapidly and readily available through crafting and LFR), and divisive. And frustrating as hell to complete on certain specs too. Good riddance to it.</div></div><hr />

(It was significantly more dreary on my elemental shaman alt than on my arms warrior, for instance.)<br />
<br />
Problem is that PG doesn't prove much, i did heroics early in WoD, people still failed to LoS cannon guy in Grimrail depot, and made all the mistakes that random people could make in other heroics too, so how did PG silver help? Why do the whole &quot;The sky is falling!&quot;-thing all of a sudden?</div></div><hr />

Not sure about the novels with Christie Golden, so I don't know why they are considered bad for some.<br />
<br />
Now, what scares me is this:<br />
<br />
&quot;...the strong and fiercely independent Frostwolf Clan are faced with increasingly harsh winters and thinning herds. When Gul’dan, a mysterious outsider, arrives in Frostfire Ridge offering word of new hunting lands...&quot;<br />
<br />
Since the beginning, I was always afraid of that &quot;Our world is dying...&quot; that Durotan says, to justify the invasion. Now more than ever, it looks like Burning Legion won't play a part in it, and it's all a &quot;dude pls we are here for food so pls lets work together and be friends&quot;.<br />
<br />
You can only get so much done in the time frame of a movie. Plus, Dreanor was dying, after Guldan tricked them into drinking the blood, it's why the Draenei left and crash landed on Azeroth.<br />
<br />
I won't speak to Golden, or the other authors. I'm fairly picky about books and authors, only because of the long years I've had to wade through crap to get to the good books, in multiple genres. I got about a chapter into one of the WoW books, when I realized the WoW books are not for me - but I admit I'm super picky, so if other people like them, it's fine. <br />
<br />
I'd love to see what real talent could do with a WOW book, like a Jerry Pournelle/Larry Niven collaboration.</div></div><hr />

Yes - I could have just gone Frost to faceroll my way through, but that's not the point - I was going to be running heroics as Arcane, so I tried to use the system.<br />

Don't worry, you can always do Mythic+ dungeons to show off your elite status with your fellow elite players and as they are premade you won't have to soil yourself with the presence of everyone you regard as inferior forms of life because they aren't as good at a videogame as you<br />

<br />
Precisely, the massive disparity in the challenge for different classes alone made Proving Grounds a joke. The main thing they were &quot;Proving&quot; was that it took a lot more effort and skill to pass playing a warlock than a hunter. <br />
<br />
I couldn't figure out why I failed a couple of goes playing my affliction warlock and found it a bit of a pain (lack of practise after a 4 year gap didn't help of course). Then I did it again with a freshly levelled hunter and though wtf<br />
<br />
Affliction's rampup times, awful aoe, lack of burst and reliance on random procs to get shards made PG at all levels way more of a pain than doing it with a huntard, which has things like Barrage, is totally unimpeded by movement, stuns and interrupts out of it's ears and a secondary resource that isn't RNG at all.<br />
<br />
PG is doable by any class and any spec. To pretend it was a test of skill that could stop bad players from Heroic content is a joke because for some classes it was a complete faceroll.<br />
<br />
You don't realise this at all until you've done it with alts. If you only did it as a hunter or afflock, you'd get entirely false impressions</div></div><hr />

Wierd that warlocks are so low. Ive recently tried to get dps title and failed on both mage and Warrior. Im a really shitty player, but when i did it on my affliction lock i got the achivement on second try. PG is super easy as lock, just dot everything up, use haunt on prio targets and cataclysm for aoe. It was a real breeze to like Wave 50 when i got bored and lost Focus.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't perfect, but helped to screen out players who were clueless about how to play their spec, whether it was dps trying to play a healing spec they'd never invested time in learning, boosted toons who couldn't be bothered to learn their rotations before queuing, or just players who needed mentoring/more practice before queuing to do mythics (I don't mind carrying guildies who need mentoring, but not every run for strangers).<br />
<br />
We got by before PG, of course, but back then we weren't realm crossing either. When you started looking in trade chat to fill out your raid, you knew most of the names and how they'd done last time you raided with them. Hard to do that with players from all different realms showing up in your queue.<br />

The breakdown above doesn't breakdown to Spec, for example - I found Arcane mage abysmal and Frost not too bad. There isn't really any way to determine spec performance, but the evidence is clear that there are issues with the existing system.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure part of Blizzard's decision was knowing EXACTLY what that break down was, and realising it was faulty. With no simple solution - abandoning it as a gating tool was their 'easiest' option.<br />

That's why you found it piss easy, practise practise<br />
<br />
And PG actually taught you very little about your class<br />
<br />
For example, certain phases can be rendered very easy by the use of Cataclysm as a warlock, and that's a talent you won't be using much in dungeons and hardly ever in raids, except on meaningless trash packs<br />
<br />
The best way to manage interrupts on healers in PG as a lock is to use the Observer and optic blast<br />
<br />
Again, in dungeons and raids you will not be using that pet and you won't be on interrupt duty because there will invariably be several others who can do it more easily and effectively</div></div><hr />

After failing 10 times on the AOE bits because afflock sucks tremendous ass at AOE (as I am sure Spriest also had issues), I learned a second spec on this character for the first time, just go get destro and AOE it up.

Yeah but you're overlooking the ones who couldn't pass. They were even worse than the ones who did. And tbh, it was much easier on some classes than others. That part needed to be improved.
