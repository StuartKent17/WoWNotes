<br />
Icecrown Citadel Raid Buffs Active<br />
The zone-wide buff (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/icecrown-citadel-zone-buff-blue-posts/) is now official.<br />
As many of you may have noticed, the Icecrown Citadel raid buffs have been activated. These buffs increase total health, healing done and damage dealt by 5% for all raid members. In addition, the number of attempts on the final bosses of each wing and the Lich King allotted raid groups on Heroic difficulty has been increased to 35. These buffs -- referred to as Strength of Wrynn for the Alliance and Hellscream’s Warsong for the Horde -- can be deactivated by speaking to your faction’s leader at Light’s Hammer. <br />
<br />
Patch 3.3.3 Notes Update<br />
The Patch 3.3.3 Notes have been updated with a couple of extra class changes and clarifications.<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
The amount of Honor awarded for an Honorable Kill has been increased by 100% for characters of all levels. This change will effectively double the amount of Honor received from Honorable Kills, or for completing Battleground and Wintergrasp objectives; however, the amount of experience gained from completing Battleground objectives and the amount of Honor rewarded for completing each Wintergrasp quest remain unchanged. <br />

Priest Tier-10 4-Piece Healing Set Bonus: Redesigned. This bonus now increases the effectiveness of the caster's Power Word: Shield and Renew spells by 5%.<br />
Shaman Tier-10 4-Piece Elemental set Bonus: This bonus has been slightly adjusted to account for the fact that haste now modifies Flame Shock's periodic damage ticks. The bonus now makes the shaman's Lava Burst cause Flame Shock to tick at least two additional times before expiring.<br />

No...no you wouldn't...sure people like to lie to them selves and pretend they can tell the difference, but seriously you really can't under any normal circumstances.<br />

As for what the eye can perceive, some people can testably perceive 90 or 100 fps.<br />
<br />
Most lcd monitors, though, are 60hz. So unless you have a newer 100 or 120hz monitor, you're never seeing more than 60, no matter what 3dmark says your card is pumping out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes you would notice the difference, the 30fps works on movies because there is a motion blur that happens when the frame is captured, if you get a still frame at any one point during the movie if something is movie it will be blurred, since wow and most games dont have motion blur then the difference between 30-100 is very noticeable, and the motion blur that is in most games suck atm, it's not smooth is very pixelated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Huffman</div><div class="date">2010-03-03, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To put things into perspective: you CAN notice differences in moving pictures up to 60Hz, if you really pay attention. More makes sense only if your image is going black-to-white all the time (like in old CRT monitors).<br />
<br />
One advantage of the limitation: it saves CPU and GPU resources. If your game runs at maximum framerate, it will essentially run as fast as your machine allows, eating up 100% of your CPU (bit less if you have multicores). Now that the drawing of the graphics is already taking all your resources, other (non-graphic) parts of your game might run into problems.<br />
<br />
This is actually a common issue in 3D graphics, which programmers must consider. I don't think they had that problem,, but why waste computing power on some extra frames that you won't be seeing anyway?<br />
<br />
P.S. you might note that most of your TFT monitors can't even display more than 60-80.</div></div><hr />

It's right there in the wiki link that was posted:<br />
<br />
&quot;The human visual system does not see in terms of frames; it works with a continuous flow of light/information. A related question is, “how many frames per second are needed for an observer to not see artifacts?” <br />
<br />
However, this question too does not have a single straightforward answer. If the image is switching between black and white each frame, then this image will appear to flicker when the pattern is shown at rates slower than 30 frames per second. In other words, the flicker-fusion point, where the eyes see gray instead of flickering tends to be around 60 Hz. <br />
<br />
However, for fast moving objects, frame rates may need to be even higher to avoid judder (non-smooth motion) artifacts. And the retinal fusion point can vary in different people, as well as depending on lighting conditions.&quot;<br />
<br />
On old CRT monitors, even on a computer sitting idle at desktop I instantly notice if the screen is set to the windows default of 60Hz. Not until I can raise the Hz to at least 75, preferrably 85, do my eyes feel comfortable looking at it. For graphically &quot;fast&quot; games, my eyes get more comfortable all the way up to 100Hz/FPS.<br />
<br />
People need to stop talking out of their asses on this subject.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyclonus</div><div class="date">2010-03-03, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">all this &quot;err your eyes cannot see more that 50 / 60 whatever fps is totally inaccurate when referring to a computer game.<br />
<br />
It is correct our eyes can only see 50-75 fps, however, this is because of the high resolution our eyes are. If you run a game at 1024 or lower, you can 100% tell the difference between 70fps 85fps and 100fps. the FPS is directly related to the resolution of the lens (our eyes / or monitor)<br />
<br />
So playing on 1900 x 1080 most people should be able to see the difference between 60fps and 120fps instantly. <br />
<br />
Also Latency acts as a multiplier for this. Our eyes run at (0ms if you will) so of course everything appears smooth at 75fps. factor in latency and its a different story.</div></div><hr />

For this reason, it is usually recommended to use a display capable of at least 120 Hz, but 200 Hz is optimal. Unfortunately most monitors cannot handle this rate, especially at higher resolutions.<br />
<br />
This is where the 200 comes from. So while you can't recognize the difference between 100hz and 200hz you can tell the difference between 60hz and 100hz when playing in stereo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the reason is that there's high end cards that can render wow at more than 200fps and were probably suffering from irregular framerate. It's usually a good idea to have a framerate limiter in any game engine, because having a consistent framerate is more important than pushing it to the max at all time, which can lead into annoying framerate spikes when the scene's complexity varies.<br />
<br />
As to why they've put the limit so high, I don't know. As someone mentioned, it might be for the sake of 3d display. Personally I always run games with vsync enabled because I hate tearing so it naturally limits it to 60fps anyway.</div></div><hr />

Only thing is that there can be, and there difinitly are, framespikes - which means game is having different speed of frame-showing than in other time. For example, in second one, it shows 60 frames, however in 1/3 of second second it loads up big location an a lot of spells and game generes much lower number of frames. Lets say 5 instead of 25.<br />
<br />
Now in actuall fps you got for that second is 55, which you shouldnt notice in normal wowscene. However you saw that 1/3 of second(or any time really, this is just random example) which lagged.<br />
<br />
In the end very confusing situation will come out: You realize that you can see a graphic problem even on 150 fps, because its just possible the way computer works. Real framerate in games is different from theory. <br />
<br />
Because lets think of our game as a movie. Movie that wont have and frames-spikes, and it will show every frame in appropriate time in second, nice and continouous. Now if you watch this game movie two times - with 50 fps and with 70 fps, you will see no difference, there just wont be any for you(considering that frames are after themself in same time amounts, 0.02 seconds in 50 mkovie). You may say you see something, but that will be lies. <br />

Stop. Stop NOW and look up the definition of Science.<br />
<br />
Done it yet? Good.<br />
<br />
Opinions count about as much as a rat's arse when it comes to reaching scientific conclusions. A little less, actually, because a rat's arse can be used to acquire data sets under the proper condition. If you truly, honestly give half a damn about human visual capabilities, why don't you read up on some actual studies that have undergone the scientific method and have been tested for rigor - or better yet, conduct the experiments yourself while maintaining an unprejudiced position. What you should never do is make meaningless postulations based upon internet hearsay and rumor mongering - that helps no one.<br />
<br />
People like you are the type of people who wanted to burn Galileo at the stake. People like you are the type of people who un-questioningly stood by the Catholic Church during the reformation period. People like you have probably never conducted any research of your own into anything, content to blindly spout off the information other people give you regardless of it's accuracy. People like you, piss me off.<br />
<br />
You remind me of an Economics/Ethics Class I took in college, during one of our postulation days. One of my classmates posed the &quot;Human's only use X% of the brain&quot; myth - which I opposed. Unfortunately, the teacher took her side of it, and the rest of the class soon followed. It took me a half an hour of showing them study after study proving that they were wrong; and it only took that long because of the mentality that you and so many others on this board right now are sharing, that majority opinion made scientific fact.<br />
<br />
They figured, if so many of us believe it, it has to be true. Please, anyone here who is sharing this mentality concerning any matter of Scientific Theory - physical, biological or chemical - kindly get the hell off my interwebs, you pseudo-intellectual pollutants.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - <br />

<br />
So many incorrect stuff posted... my good...<br />
<br />
At least one must be corrected, there is no &quot;I guess&quot; on this one... limiting your refresh rate is not limiting your hardware performance. Your cpu and graphic card is still performing at their max, but your monitor won't handle the extra frames and MAY show artifacts/tearing depending on the kind of game/moving image you're watching (and not because you can notice 60 to 100, 100 to 200 fps, but because the monitor is not showing the correct &quot;next&quot; frame and is skipping a frame between 2). That's also where VSYNC comes into play (wich ppl misunderstood as monitor refresh rate), so the computer itself only sends the expected frames to the monitor to try to avoid those problems. But also, they're not limiting their performance too, if the game demands the full performance of your hardware to keep the 60 fps (for a 60hz refresh rate), it will have it. There is no &quot;enabling VSYNC kills your high-end expensive hardware&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fzhfzh</div><div class="date">2010-03-03, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many don't understand what they are talking about, it doesn't matter whether your eye can differentiate between 60hz or 200hz, problem is, even if the game can go up to 1000hz, the monitor itself can only render at 60hz refresh rate, some 3D monitors 120hz, so you will still only see 60 or 120 anyways. <br />
<br />
The framerate the blue is talking about is the game's internal framerate, or the rendering loop ran per second, although the rendering can only go up to 60 or 120, the logic processing can be more accurate to a smaller fraction of a second.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Unless you paid a very significant fortune for a very high end monitor, you never see more than 60 FPS. the vast majority of LCD monitors run at 60hz. It doesn't matter what your monitoring software tells you your FPS is. Usually though, if the video card is able to do 100FPS on a specific model, it can also make sure that lots of screen artifacts, tearing and other Bad Things TM aren't happening. So you may feel like you're getting a smother picture. <br />
<br />
Edit: I stand slightly corrected. Seems they've come down in price. They're now only slightly more expensive than comparable 60hz monitors. Still doubt very many people have them yet, they were quite expensive until recently, and you'd have to know you wanted to go out your way to get one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PPl tend to give too much attention to FPS<br />
<br />
FPS = Frame per Second.<br />
<br />
Its a average vallue. <br />
<br />
The real important stuff is the time to render frame in ms. If you have 100 FPS but one frame into that second took 0,4 sec to render, the game is not fluid. you see the difference. (like if you have a random disk access or something.)<br />
<br />
But, if all your frame take less than 16.6 ms to render (60 fps) your game will look really fluid. Your average fps will be highter than 60 also (if its not fixed internally) (in normal contrast scenes)<br />
<br />
Triple buffering and stuff like that can lead to a fluider game at lower frame rate. (but it limit your framerate to your refresh rate)<br />
<br />
PPL prefer FPS because its growth with a more powerfull computer, so their epeen growth accordingly. But the more important stuff to see if a game is fluid is the maximum time to render a frame. not the FPS. <br />
<br />

Done it yet? Good.<br />

Opinions count about as much as a rat's arse when it comes to reaching scientific conclusions. A little less, actually, because a rat's arse can be used to acquire data sets under the proper condition. If you truly, honestly give half a damn about human visual capabilities, why don't you read up on some actual studies that have undergone the scientific method and have been tested for rigor - or better yet, conduct the experiments yourself while maintaining an unprejudiced position. What you should never do is make meaningless postulations based upon internet hearsay and rumor mongering - that helps no one.<br />
<br />
People like you are the type of people who wanted to burn Galileo at the stake. People like you are the type of people who un-questioningly stood by the Catholic Church during the reformation period. People like you have probably never conducted any research of your own into anything, content to blindly spout off the information other people give you regardless of it's accuracy. People like you, piss me off.<br />
<br />
You remind me of an Economics/Ethics Class I took in college, during one of our postulation days. One of my classmates posed the &quot;Human's only use X% of the brain&quot; myth - which I opposed. Unfortunately, the teacher took her side of it, and the rest of the class soon followed. It took me a half an hour of showing them study after study proving that they were wrong; and it only took that long because of the mentality that you and so many others on this board right now are sharing, that majority opinion made scientific fact.<br />
<br />
They figured, if so many of us believe it, it has to be true. Please, anyone here who is sharing this mentality concerning any matter of Scientific Theory - physical, biological or chemical - kindly get the hell off my interwebs, you pseudo-intellectual pollutants.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - <br />

Science. It works, bitches. Shut the @#$% up if you don't have rigor to back up your drivel.<br />

Either:<br />
<br />
A - MMO-Champion is right, and the WoW-EU site is just out of date and incorrect, or<br />
<br />
B - RetCon<br />

Would be nice for more people to face Algalon. It's a fun fight.</div></div><hr />

That all depends on your definition of kills. VSYNC does have a negative impact on your input devices.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rathyl</div><div class="date">2010-03-04, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not even that significant. In full 25 man raid buffs and a mix of half ICC10/25 gear, it's not more than a 40 dps increase. (Which you can attribute to RNG). If an arms warriors is present in the raid, that number drops even more (more than likely to single digit dps increases even at 25 man composition). I suppose it's just to switch our rotation up slightly - but ever so slightly. The glyph, however, might see some pvp usage now (but never raid usage). <br />
<br />
<br />
Its actually a large upgrade, as now you only need to mangle once per minute, which frees up each of those mangles in rotations for shreds, which in turn can help manage the rips more effectively, and give more chances for ferocious bites. I fail to see how its an upgrade with an arms warrior either, as you should never mangle with an arms warrior in the raid in the first place, pre patch.</div></div><hr />

Dissing others doesn't make your clarify your wrong statement about Mangle being a bleed. Resorting to flaming doesn't do it either.</div></div><hr />
