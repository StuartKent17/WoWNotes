He hits like a truck on the tanks and the raid damage seems really high. This and the fact that you have only 1 hour to learn him means that only the best players will down him soon, not the players with the most time on their hands. Skill &gt; Time spent playing (at least for this boss).</div></div><hr />

yeah. and don't stand in red shit... usual stuff.<br />
only thing is the damage is high on both the raid and the tank.<br />

Which is why there are not that many other aspects to it. Brief description is you kill the stars staggered so one does not overlap with a cosmic smash (cosmic smash does more damage closer you are to it, the stars gradually kill/do damage to themselves and when they die they do roughly 10k to the raid - if you ignore them they all die simultaneously and you wipe.)<br />
<br />
Not going to give out all the goodies but likewise, grats to them - well deserved.<br />

Nice to see the fight in its complete entirety, maybe we can knock it out this week also.<br />

Most fights look simple watching(mimiron hard mode can be seen as dps as normal and dodge the static fire), but doing it is a whole different story.<br />
He is meant to be Harder then the hardmode of the keepers you have to do to defeat him and some of them seems simple also(when you only talk about what you do, for example, Thorin is, tank the extra add avoiding her abilities and kill thorin hard with extra healing) etc etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really, the 25 men version is quite buggy with &quot;wipe resume&quot;, Algalon can be struck for many minutes after a wipe, it occurs nearly never in 10 men version (and obviously he hits harder in R25).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That makes even more sense, annoyed that you might actually get some competition to world first on heroic?<br />
<br />
Plus its not attention whoring you dumbass, its actually helping players by giving them an idea what the fight is like, i am sorry you people from ensidia are not the only one who knows anymore and its spreading to the whole player database.</div></div><hr />

And Tun get real man, what's wrong with releasing the vid? The only reason Ensidia didn't release one was not help other possible contestors. You had at least 2 weeks head start and you will propably kill him first anyways so stop being an ass.</div></div><hr />

If you want that kind of fun, just don't watch the video. It's labeled obviously enough to be avoidable if you don't want any spoilers. <br />

I'm really disappointed by this reaction. I had hoped a member of Ensidia would be much more polite about this. <br />

<br />
Fight basically boils down to:<br />
<br />
- Avoid big red boulders falling from sky.<br />
- Keep consistent DPS on the Sparks and time their kills so they don't happen simultaneous to a Cosmic Smash<br />
- 2 tank rotation for Phase Punches<br />
- Click portals for Big Bang<br />
- Kite adds for a few seconds when phased out<br />
- Kite those constellation globes that aggro at various parts of the fight<br />
<br />
Obviously still a huge accomplishment to get there and do it with only a few hours of attempts, but still.<br />
<br />
I personally find Alone in the Darkness (0 Keeper Yoggy) to be a much bigger accomplishment. No Thorim killing adds at the end when you don't have all the other Keepers' buffs is serious f-ing business.</div></div><hr />

If you start doing Yogg fresh without any pre-existing strategies or anything, going straight for the 0 watchers, then yes it's harder than Algalon. But 0-watcher Yogg in 10s isn't a big deal, though. We had literally over half a minute of idle time upstairs yesterday with just one watcher up with the same raid setup as on the Algalon vid; the DPS isn't the issue there at all. Probably going to do it on the weekend, only gave the 0-watcher a few tries - didn't notice the P3 being that different either except having to taunt the beaconed healer add away.<br />
<br />
Algalon isn't complex by any means. It only has few elements in it that are fairly counter-intuitive. But given the nature of the encounter and the time limit it has, it'd be silly if the fight was like Yogg with 0 watchers. It would take some months for guilds to even grasp it, not to mention to perfect it and kill it. What it comes down to is what you define as hard. Slapping 1h/reset timer is a bit artificial, but so is just upping DPS requirements and making bosses hit for 80% of tank's HP pool worth of damage each hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the grats and stuff though. 8]<br />
<br />
For the few sour grapes: Of course the objective is to get some more fame and thus improve our guild. Pretty poor guild leadership had we not; it'd be a huge missed opportunity to not try to get a few more quality recruits. The video was intentionally released as soon as possible as we have nothing to gain from holding it back. Try using logic before typing random garbage and posting it.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, this fight doesn´t look like very challenging :/ As i watched this vid, I saw only few things, which can make some problems - that fiery boulder (like Mimi´s rocket), AoE, and sparks and stuff like that. However, perhaps it is harder than it seems...<br />

Most fights look simple watching(mimiron hard mode can be seen as dps as normal and dodge the static fire), but doing it is a whole different story.<br />
He is meant to be Harder then the hardmode of the keepers you have to do to defeat him and some of them seems simple also(when you only talk about what you do, for example, Thorin is, tank the extra add avoiding her abilities and kill thorin hard with extra healing) etc etc.<br />

You're right, the &quot;race&quot; for Algalon is destroyed, seeing how Ensidia did it last week.<br />
<br />
Any guild currently capable of attempting him in 10 or 25, is capable of downing him without a video. There aren't many &quot;bad guilds&quot; that have access to him right now. They have the skills, it's a matter of execution.<br />
<br />
I think someone's jealous their guild was beaten to the kill lol</div></div><hr />

Accusing someone of doing anything wrong when they release a video of it after it has been killed is silly. Complaining because of any resemblence with other fights (like 10 man relating to 25 man in this case) is also rather silly since we are then dealing with information wars, where whoever is getting info shared is at an advantage. As long as Ensidia were alone in having this information they had every right to restrict or release this information as they saw fit, just as the Underground Kosmonauts now have every right to share this information with whomever they wish. The race for Algalon-25 is still very much on, and if for some reason any guild but Ensidia manages to down him first then that will be an effect of that guild beeing better at what was required. Ensidia have never been at any unfair disadvantage in this race, they have no right to complain.</div></div><hr />

It would've been more fun if it would've been a boss that actually was a bit unknown for a few months rather than getting complete guides on it after a few weeks.<br />
<br />
For those saying &quot;just don't watch the video&quot;, do you actually believe it will work that way? No way. Guilds are to 99% focused on getting it done and will watch the video.<br />
<br />
Would've been nice if everyone would've waited with the releases until at least the 25 man had been killed. But I totally understand kosmonauts for releasing its. HF with all the new applies :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taking into account that only 7 guilds (Ensidia, Stars, Method, Premonition, Inner Sanctum, Refuge &amp; Wraith) so far have access to him on 25man version (which is the only kill left at the moment), and all of them are quite respected guilds that have been around for a long time, I seriously doubt that guild XYZ will just go in, clear all the hardmodes required, and beat the guilds that have been working on him to killing Algalon before them.</div></div><hr />

How would a scrub brownsucker like you know that? You don`t even have the easier things done, not to mention a single Ulduar hardmode. Trashing other ppl in other topics while being a scrub of renown magnitude is very smart.<br />
<br />
Also, if any of the whiners here, including Tun, actually bothered to check, these guys had access to algalon 10 since FIRST reset. Which means they simply did not mannage the execution to beat Ensidia, which sometimes, can be caused by RNG as well. We all know how &quot;perfect&quot; the game is/was. <br />
<br />
We all remember 10man 3 drakes Sartharion and Tun`s whine again on Raid and Dungeon boards (which he deleted as a good puppy when ordered by his GMs). And if 10 mans did not matter, why did Ensidia boast about THIS and 0 watcher Yogg?<br />

<br />
Why care if people say techno instead? It has become a generic term used by people who don't listen to techno, trance and other genres in electronic music, or people who don't know enough about music to know the difference. Probably cause most of the genres people bunch up as techno has roots in the style.<br />
<br />
I sure don't expect people to know the difference between Speed Metal and Thrash Metal since most people only know it under the generic term Heavy Metal which of course is a genre itself too.<br />
<br />
The same thing exist in many other kinds of music, like Jazz. Do you know the difference between Bebob, Hardbop, Cool Jazz, Fusion or maybe New Orleans vs. Chicago style and say that instead of jazz?<br />
Didn't think so.<br />
And don't get me started on the similar misuse of &quot;Rock&quot;.<br />
<br />
You probably make the same mistakes as the people you complain about when it comes to music you don't listen to so I'd take it easy with the complaining and lecturing. ;)<br />

We finally released our movie of our world first Mimiron Hardmode kill, definitely the hardest boss in Ulduar on Heroic difficulty, and also the boss that stops guilds from reaching Algalon quickly. The reason for it being released this &quot;late&quot; is because we were waiting for another European or American guild to kill it, we are releasing it now because a lot of people have been waiting for it and we want to be the first to do so.</div></div><hr />

You don`t even have the easier things done, not to mention a single Ulduar hardmode. Trashing other ppl in other topics while being a scrub of renown magnitude is very smart.<br />
<br />
Also, if any of the whiners here, including Tun, actually bothered to check, these guys had access to algalon 10 since FIRST reset. Which means they simply did not mannage the execution to beat Ensidia, which sometimes, can be caused by RNG as well. We all know how &quot;perfect&quot; the game is/was. <br />
<br />
We all remember 10man 3 drakes Sartharion and Tun`s whine again on Raid and Dungeon boards (which he deleted as a good puppy when ordered by his GMs). And if 10 mans did not matter, why did Ensidia boast about THIS and 0 watcher Yogg?<br />

More along the lines of people who have been on him for 2 weeks and have the strat figured out on their own, where as now people who get to him today or this week will be just on par with those same guilds. Very classy for Ensidia to not post their mimiron kill or algalon kill early. Low class by this guild. Sad really.</div></div><hr />

A quick example would be thorim hard mode. Seeing the video at best would teach you to group up in 3's. No video and you would learn that after about 4 minutes.</div></div><hr />

2 guilds got him down in 10 man. Guilds that are the very best in the world. They did it in 25 man gear, thus not getting the 10 man achievement/title that you get for doing it in 10 man gear. So they overgear the encounter yet are still only 2 guilds to do it.<br />
<br />
Majority of players of WoW and raiders of Ulduar will never even see Algalon 25 let alone kill it during Ulduars lifespan (before nerfs or better gear). Only a small percentage will ever kill him. <br />
Stop whining about what people who are not you have done and go and do it yourselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't quite get it. The strategy needed to do this fight is pretty simple, but it's tuned to the point where you can't fuck up. Most groups have only had the possibility to play with him for 2-4 hours. Now it would probably take most of them 1+ hour to just learn the fight etc since they didn't have any guide or anything. How many well-tuned bosses have you killed after 1-3 hours of attempts ?<br />
<br />
There's only 2 reasons why there's not a ton of Algalon kills going down atm, Firefighter (probably the only complex fight in Ulduar) and time-limit. Without those we would've probably seen 50+ 10man Algalon kills, and atleast 10 25man if he hadn't bugged. The fight is basically designed to make the time limit the challenge.<br />

I believe the number of summoned collapsing stars and the number of peoples make BIG difference in 25 men, and the strategy changes because it.<br />
<br />
If you think it just as easy strat wise as 10 men I think you wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is what I'm seeing too.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I didn't get much information from that video. It's quite obvious the hunter was doing a lot of work, involving two &quot;planes&quot; and what I assume to be floaty mobs, and also there's something like Gluth's Decimate attack. Other than that? Nope, not much.<br />
<br />
Watching people do a fight and doing the fight yourself is completely different. I've seen doctors perform surgery on TV, does that mean I can now go out and operate on people? No, it does not. <br />
I've seen videos and programmes with people flying planes. Does this mean I can now go out and fly a plane? Again, no, it does not.<br />
Does watching this video of an Algalon kill mean I can now go out, get 9 (or 24) people and down him? Once more, no, it does not.<br />
<br />
Stop QQing about this video. It doesn't explain the tacts to you, it doesn't give you an idea of the true numbers (You'd have to do your own research into the guild's members in that raid, see what the mit was and do a load of calculations to get an accurate idea of his damage). All it does is show you what the fight looks like, and a very rough idea of what the task of ONE DPS'er was.</div></div><hr />

A lot of people have bashed Tun for this comment but I think he's right, they really shouldn't have released the video yet.<br />
<br />
Funnily, the people bashing Tun here are the same people who are complaining about how WoW is too easy etc... yet they happily download the video and spoil the fight for themselves instead of figuring it out on their own. ::)<br />

(What's even more funny, most of them aren't even close to reaching Algalon yet!)</div></div><hr />

I am one of the people who bashed tun for being an ass, he is talking about being fame seekers when he is in the biggest fame seeker guild of them all, i never once said wow is easy, i got no reason to say that atm, and no i am not close to algalon, but Hey he is an attention whore just as is his guild(read back on the quote someone posted of one of their members saying they wanted to be the first to release the mimiron hard mode video), sure they are good players on the &quot;best guild&quot; in the WoW universe, but just because someone beat them to the punch of a video(and thats not even 25) does not give him the right to insult others, who hell done a dam good job.</div></div><hr />

neither they nor their members have any control or right to this game nor the videos made of it. it seems like a case of `i wannas` to me.<br />
the fight is in a beautiful arena ,looks awesome.i cant wait to see it myself.<br />
i wont be there for another month or so i reckon but hey slowly slowly monkey n all that.<br />
<br />
back on track nice work guys and ncie vid as i said before. keep up the good work and fuck ensidia , fuck em to hell . learn to have a bit of grace you pricks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ensidia &quot;we wont be releasing the video until another guild has done it&quot;<br />
<br />
So another guild comes along and does it. *Expect Ensidia Movie any minute* - Which is fine ? right ? coz more than 1 guild has done it now<br />
<br />
<br />
Undergound followed the same policy as Ensidia - wait till 2 guilds have done it, then release.....<br />
<br />
<br />
All these Videos are actually killing PVE.... But if you release first, you get instant fame.<br />
<br />
People watch the videos before they have even attempted the encounter... Boss Mods are already up-to-date by the time 90% of guilds hit the boss.</div></div><hr />

Whats the difference between Ensidia's 'fame' and Method or anyone else's (like Underground).<br />
<br />
Ensidia's fame comes from being world first. Not for releasing a movie first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Except you do realize that now all the &quot;lagging&quot; guilds who are just getting to algalon will now kill him in like 2-3 weeks instead of like 6-8. <br />
<br />
I wish they hadn't released this as I find it a bit more fun to learn the fight yourself. However to maintain competitive with other guilds, I'll obviously be ripping this video apart for when we start Algalon this week.<br />
<br />
What's done is done however.</div></div><hr />
