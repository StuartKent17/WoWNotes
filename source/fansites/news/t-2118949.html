Patch 7.1.5 Class Changes<br />
As we mentioned before, the next PTR build will have a fairly substantial number of new class changes. We wanted to provide some insight into our goals and strategy with these changes, particularly for the specs that have seen the most change. Note that one of our overarching goals with Patch 7.1.5 is to increase talent diversity by making some of the less popular talents more attractive, which may open up new styles of play and new ways to approach different situations for all specializations, not just those we've listed here.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#NAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#M))<br />
Survival Hunter:<br />
Survival's most notable addition is some new gameplay for traps. As all Hunters will once again have traps in 7.1.5, we want to make sure that Survival still feels like the master of traps. In particular, we want to restore the concept of baiting enemies into traps, as opposed to merely dropping them at their feet for an immediate effect. A new Survival passive will grant all your traps an added effect if an enemy is led into the trap after it is placed, encouraging you to anticipate the movement of an enemy, or coordinate with your tank in group content. Talents further enhance this, allowing you to increase the bonus in situations where you can reliably make use of it, or to use a new effect on Steel Trap to singlehandedly eliminate enemies who walk into it of their own accord.<br />
<br />
Marksmanship Hunter:<br />
We agree with players that Marksmanship currently relies far too much on Patient Sniper not only to do good damage, but also to make the rotation feel fun and rewarding. As such, we’re changing baseline Vulnerability to essentially bake in Patient Sniper, and adding a new Patient Sniper talent in its place. We are also adjusting some talents to allow for more diversity within talent rows and reflect the change to the base rotation. In particular, the Level 100 row: while Sidewinders was commonly used in all situations for its effects on the rotation, we’d rather the base rotation felt fluid on its own, and Sidewinders was a talent focused on the wide-area cleave that is its most clear purpose. Among other changes to help with this, Marked Shot no longer requires the targets to have Vulnerable to do strong damage, so builds without Sidewinders will be able to use it more effectively.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#hAAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#g))<br />
Arcane Mage:<br />
Arcane is receiving several significant talent changes, to increase talent diversity and move away from some of the more problematic gameplay centered around Quickening. In addition to a new Arcane-specific shield to replace Ice Barrier, there are few utility updates not yet on the PTR: Presence of Mind will be baseline for all Arcane Mages, and a new talent will be added that allows Arcane Missiles to be channeled while moving.<br />
<br />
Fire Mage:<br />
While Fire was mostly in a good place, we’re looking at two related issues in 7.1.5; the degree to which critical strike dominates other stats, and the overly high amount of damage concentrated into Combustion. Focusing on critical strike’s very strong contribution to the damage of Combustion, as well as that of Pyretic Incantation, addresses both of these. We'll be adjusting the damage of Fire’s core spells to leave its total damage similar to what it was before these changes. We're also giving Fire its own element-themed shield, as with Arcane.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#VAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#U))<br />
Shadow Priest:<br />
Shadow’s overall pacing is being adjusted so that the highest peak is at the end of Voidform, rather than just before the start of the next one. As a part of this, Lingering Insanity is removed, but overall Insanity generation (and therefore Voidform uptime) is increased. Additionally, Mind Sear is replaced with a new passive effect that allows Mind Flay to fulfill the same purpose. Shadow already has significant multi-target gameplay from the desire to maintain two damage-over-time effects on each target (a process which being is made smoother by allowing Void Bolt to extend DoTs on multiple targets at once). Finally, we are continuing to tweak the Insanity decay rate in Voidform, and the strength of Surrender to Madness, to better balance the Level 100 row. We want to preserve the purpose and strengths of Surrender to Madness for players who enjoy it, without it being quite so ubiquitous as it is currently.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#F) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#E))<br />
Protection Warrior:<br />
While Protection’s performance is still solid, we want to provide Revenge a clearer role in the live rotation, and eliminate the need for an off-GCD ability (Focused Rage) to deal damage. To address both of these problems, Revenge is made into a higher-damage ability, which is used rotationally with its usual activation proc, but can also be used outside of that proc by spending Rage. This eliminates the need for Focused Rage. Thunder Clap will fill the role of a second Rage generator, and be used regularly while tanking. Also of note is a new talent that allows you to adopt a more open playstyle if you prefer, by making your auto attacks trigger Devastates automatically, rather than fitting it into open spaces in your rotation.<br />

Though this usually just applies for early bosses and is really risky for end bosses as it seems that is what Blizzard really cares about.

This is the reality the guilds at that level deal with in Blizzard punishing no one and fixing it later or handing out punishment.</div></div><hr />

Don't be naïve, Method, From Scratch, and every other guilds have VIP access to the Alpha/Beta, were they actively search for bug they could exploit, and of course, they DON'T report it to Bilizzard.<br />
They ALL used Odyn exploit, they ALL used infinite PA exploit, they ALL used Helya mythic exploit, Method included, but Method has the favors of Blizzard, so we will not officialy know they are cheating, because they are living adds for Blizzard.<br />
ALL top 20 world guilds should be disband and ALL of their members should be permanently banned, this is only by doing this we will have a clear game.</div></div><hr />

No its blizzard to blame, plenty of ways to just fix the issue rather then &quot;no fun for all&quot;. But nice job with the name calling.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but they are idiots. Making sure other players can't loot is not fun, it's stupid, making them idiots. It's also the reason you can't have fun using the item what it is intended for.</div></div><hr />

There are people which aren't so much interested in lore, and/or ones which haven't played in the old expansions.<br />
<br />
If you do the quest with 10+ alts for gold+exp, it can get annoying. So of course you want to speed up the process. But I'd prefer something which actually answers the question instantly instead of just displaying the answer.</div></div><hr />

Fix the buggy-ness of the looting the meat (since this item was used in Mists and half the time people could or could not loot it back then). <br />
Change permissions, so the item can't be used on a body that has loot still on it. (Can't skin a body that someone hasn't looted).<br />
One of the worst choices could be loot still on the body gets mailed to people.<br />
Three fixes just off the top of my head.<br />

Blizzard could stick to the lore and classify Helya (along with other Val'kyr) as undead. Since they are actually undead.<br />
<br />
I don't know about the knife, but the soul inhaler only works on humanoid targets, so by having Helya as an undead will prevent that toy from causing trouble. <br />
<br />
They can do it, they changed Archimonde to a demon after he was incorrectly classified as a humanoid.Since I was able to use the soul inhaler toy on him at one point<br />

<br />
<br />
Edit: NVM, I checked back. No, I said he has his fellow players to blame. Doesn't 'fellow players' mean 'other people then you'? It does to me (not native speaker), otherwise I would have said 'you only have yourself to blame'. So, sorry if that isn't correct English. I did mean other people who abused the toy ruined it for people like Tirilka who want to use the item for fun.</div></div><hr />

I honestly never even thought about using it on NPCs. I always use it on fellow raid members who don't run back for some reason. Chop them up, then set them on fire with the Cremating Torch. Shame that they are getting rid of it completely. They should just make it so you can only use it on players, like the torch.</div></div><hr />

So I'm not the only one who thought that. The spec has went almost completely untouched since early beta aside from some minor number tuning despite overwhelming feedback about how much players in general don't like how it plays now.</div></div><hr />
