Enter the One-Button Authenticator! This update to the current Mobile Authenticator will allow you to securely log into your account by simply clicking Approve on your mobile device instead of entering a security code.

<br />
Whenever* a log in attempt occurs on your account you will be notified via the app and prompted to Approve or Deny the request. You can also approve log in requests with notifications on your mobile or smartwatch without even opening the app! We hope this will help ease the log in process for those of you that already have an authenticator and encourage those of you who don’t to give it a try. You can find out more about authenticators on our Battle.net Authenticator FAQ (https://battle.net/support/article/battle-net-authenticator-faq).<br />
<br />
The Mobile Authenticator with the new One-Button feature is available now on iOS® and Android™.<br />
<br />
*Please note that by default you will only need to approve a log in attempt once a week per device. You can change this setting on your Battle.net Account Management page (https://battle.net/account/management/authenticator.html).</div></div><hr />

Nah, they will never support it. No Armory app and this new Auth will never come to windows phone. That why i will never buy on again. I realy like windows phones for their style and so on. But not having most of the usefull apps is sooo annoying</div></div><hr />

While your general point has some validity in terms of making sure you know what you are agreeing to when installing apps, the Blizzard Authenticator android app has one permission request in it and it's for storage. So when you say never trust something for free I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. <br />

I second this. My account got hijacked by goldsellers back in the beginning of Wrath because of one miss-click on the old forums. Purchased an Authenticator after that. Don't wait for something bad to happen, prevent it!</div></div><hr />

Giving permissions doesn't mean they can turn on your gps or read your sms or take pictures of you... It gives the app the ability to use those functions within your phone within the app. By this logic, you shouldn't use the phone app because it grants permission to the microphone. Spooky stuff.</div></div><hr />

I saw the mobile app on my husband's phone and thought &quot;Aaaaahhhh... too many numbers to type in!&quot;. I did eventually switch though because a) I was really worried that my authenticator would die at the worst moment, and b) it helped that I didn't have to type in that long number every single time I wanted to log in. One button though, once a week? Yes please.</div></div><hr />

I don't really use many apps, there hasn't been anything I really wanted that hasn't been catered for. Had the armory on my Android phone but rarely used it.<br />
<br />
I prefer my Lumia to my previous Android phones. Just got annoyed with the bloatware I coudn't delete without rooting the OS. I've heard things are a bit better now, and I guess I'll have to go Android when I get my next phone anyway.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't refering to the authenticator it's just that it's not every day you hear &quot;i do not have/want a smart phone&quot; i have the physical one too but i got sick of not having it when I wanted to log on to the forums/game at work or a friends house so I downloaded the mobile app.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wouldn't you still have to call her? There seems to be another issue here. Why are you forgetting your phone when you go out?<br />
<br />
True, but have you ever tried to login with an authenticator through phone or instant messaging? Now i can just log on on to facebook and message her to hit accept on my phone. Also i have a bad habbit of leaving my phone lying around or in my workbag and even some times in my car. #1stworldproblems</div></div><hr />

Android 6 asks for permissions when you run app and you can refuse any of them. Either root or upgrade your phone. But yeah overall permissions asked by apps are outrageous sometimes.</div></div><hr />

It's probably not worth it for the small number of Windows Phone users that would use it. (And for those interested, Windows phones now account for less than 1% of the market share and it's continuing to die).</div></div><hr />

Wife and I both bought the core hound auth the day it released. They both are working to this day and we've been subbed almost the entire time since we bought them. That was what? Over 7 years ago. Trust me, these things last and there is no sign of the battery dying yet. When it does die I'll likely switch to this app though.</div></div><hr />

Has anyone here ever read what permissions you grant apps on your phone? Access to photos... eh? Access to contact numbers.... wait why? Access to sms... hold on a second. Access to Camera.... now wait just a damn minute. Access to GPS.... wtf has this gotta do with an app for solitaire?<br />
<br />
Never trust something for free.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can turn the gps off and apps will still work smartass</div></div><hr />

Key word I THINK it was. The hypocrisy in that is amusing I must say.<br />

Method exploited the Saronite Bombs to respawn the platform's outer ring when it fell down.</div></div><hr />

I've had the physical one since early WOTLK it still works fine and I only have to use it like once every 6 months or so.... I haven't used it since I built my desktop almost a year ago<br />
<br />
Lucky you then. With my constantly changing IP I have to use the authenticator every day. And I don't know why b.net isn't adapting to my changing IPs. Seems my ISP just sucks. This change is super awesome for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So to those saying 7-8 years seems unbelievable, get believing :)<br />
<br />
I have the same one, still works!! :D<br />
<br />
EDIT** I've never actually had it attached to my keys, so that probably extended it's life quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

Nope, your ISP does not sucks..it`s standard..2 kind of IP exists (well, commonly) static and dynamic. <br />

Even if someone gets a hold of your phone, they still can't get in - even if your password is 123bunny.<br />

Giving permissions doesn't mean they can turn on your gps or read your sms or take pictures of you... It gives the app the ability to use those functions within your phone within the app. By this logic, you shouldn't use the phone app because it grants permission to the microphone. Spooky stuff.<br />
<br />
Actually this is where you are indeed wrong. When you give permission for an app that lets say requires your camera, you are indeed giving them the right to USE that camera when ever they like. In many many companies they use the reverse selfie cam to take pictures of their clients before recording data on them. <br />
All this paranoia tinfoil hat bullshit comes from morons who don't read terms of service and just click agree to anything. <br />
<br />
I don't really give a shit about the name calling, from other peeps, i know what i know and privacy is important to me. Enjoy your Windows 10 and spy apps xD</div></div><hr />

<br />
Genuinly wondering, if it isn't EASIER to hack a phone, than it is to aquire the physical representation of a small authenticator.<br />
<br />
Granted, i don't know how the Authenticator works on a mechanical level, if it can be hacked into...</div></div><hr />

Is there something else I need to setup to make this work???</div></div><hr />

When you get the authenticator prompt when logging into WoW or the Blizzard website you get a popup notification on your phone exactly like a facebook messenger popup with the options beneath it &quot;Accept&quot; and &quot;Decline&quot;.<br />
<br />
If that isn't happening then it's surely something on your end, For a Samsung phone you might want to prevent the authenticator app from &quot;optimising&quot; in the Smart Manager Provider.</div></div><hr />
