Warlords of Draenor - New Mage Spells<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Orc Clan Armor Sets<br />
Today we are taking a look at another of the Orc Clan armor sets, the Thunderlord and Frostwolf Clans. These sets are currently not available to players.<br />
<br />

No instant starsurge affects DPS on the move alot.Most moonkins use starsurge instant cast procs as a 1 second time of movement<br />
We decided to go with trying Instant Starsurges. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473323667594555392))<br />
<br />
Will Moonkin be able to show their armor or are we destined to always be owl beast models from duskwood no matter the gear? <br />
Did you miss Glyph of Stars? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473325592813645825))<br />
<br />
Sine-wave is very forgiving to timing. The bonus damage is minute due to it. And it's very, very easy to learn&amp;master.<br />
FYI, based on testing, we're going to try a 40sec long cycle (still 20sec with Euphoria). DoT base duration raised to 20sec too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473493727437012992))<br />
It also pauses at the ends now (most of the added time).Nerdy details: Now a sine wave between -110 and 110, capped at -100/100 (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473494231097438208))<br />
This change makes it less stressful, not really less skillful. Skill is still strong. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473538341799878656))<br />
Starsurge and Astral Communion usage are the biggest high end skill differentiators now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473538647732400128))<br />
DoT uptime and Wrath/Starfire are solid core mechanics to master. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473538875294351362))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br />
Would u consider cutting two seconds off freezing trap and scatter so they can coexist in WoD? Scatter is ideal for landing traps.<br />
We'll see how the change works out in testing. There is a benefit of getting rid of an instant CC button. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473532110263709697))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
will the base damage increase to tanks be enough to make leveling as prot viable?<br />
Absolutely. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473255954171953152))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U))<br />
Doesn't that mean in effect, that Devouring Plague still technically snapshots?<br />
Yes, for [6/Haste] sec. Little snapshots like that are fine. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/473493234522390529))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Hey, Will we ever see new weapons with cool 'equip' or 'chance on hit' effects like the ones from DS?<br />
Potentially. We try to mix it up. Some tiers we go a little more crazy with trinkets, sometimes weapons, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472265388248403968))<br />
<br />
not sure what the state of tier bonuses is in WOD, but will Mythic tier have the same bonuses as Normal/Heroic tier?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/472311311997489153))<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
Herald of the Titans achieve/title still going to be available in WoD?<br />
Should be, yes. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/472258367671791617))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Will garrisons have any PvP aspects/benefits/gameplay involved? Thanks!<br />
still discussing (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472349389923434496))<br />
<br />
Wtf Heart of the Valorous? How about Honorable Heart or Hear of the Conqueror for a bit? (C'mon you knew it was coming)<br />
Valor and Conquest serve very different purposes. Valor doesn't give you gear. Conquest does. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472425747999490048))<br />
There are already tremendous catch-up mechanics in place for PvP: rating inflation and catch-up cap. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472425881441284096))<br />
<br />
One of the issue's with Ret in PvP atm is that Templar's Verdict is too weak as a finisher. Outside of major cd's Ret is no threat.<br />
&quot;Outside of cooldowns I'm not threat&quot; is a complaint we here from every spec with cooldowns. It's why we're removing many of them. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472790124283957249))<br />
<br />
Just wondering if you guys have put any thought into scaling gear up in pvp (bgs) before WoD?<br />
No there is tech involved to do this that's coming in Warlords. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/472793339230572545))<br />
<br />
Will PvP set bonuses change as we change spec in WoD?<br />
yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473539416141873153))<br />
<br />
is chaos bolt damage reduced by 25% against player?<br />
Yes it's damage is reduced against players in Mists. Possibly not in Warlords. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473530994188771328))<br />
In WOD pvp crit reduction means CB does 25% less against players anyway, doesn't it?<br />
yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473539469279522816))<br />
Dont you think crit and other stats should be downscaled in PVE too? To have the same rules for PVE and PVP?<br />
Crits are awesome so you can say &quot;woah HUGE number&quot; but gameplay dictates different magnitudes in two modes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473560070396313600))<br />
<br />
could we see some news on Ashran soon? Would love to see some more in-depth discussion about the &quot;Ashran Only&quot; weapons.<br />
We're getting to a point where we think we'll have a lot more to share soon. But we're early on in that process. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/473576727235407873))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Out of curiosity, will our friends in the farm become followers in our garrison?<br />
The Panda farm? They don't... really want to go through that portal. Best to stay near a brewery. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/472222928923156480))<br />

Although i wish Blizz teams didn't crossbreed their games so much.

In the end lets just merge all the games together :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is likely a missing texture, as there is a burning sound afterwards for some time. Flamestrike has the same problem, the texture on the ground is missing. Frozen orb has a similar problem as well, the bolts that come off of it are missing.</div></div><hr />

Only to add others ...<br />

No consistency here. Or stupid game design . If you want more spells let the old one in game and add others. If you want less, remove old, don't add others .</div></div><hr />

It isn't confirmed the Horde will even be getting a Frostwolf set yet.<br />

Unrelated to the above quote, the Thunderlord set has a matching head not shown here, it's a helmet made of a new-Ravager skull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Only to add others ...<br />
<br />
<br />
No consistency here. Or stupid game design . If you want more spells let the old one in game and add others. If you want less, remove old, don't add others .<br />
<br />
You do realize that in this particular case, that's not exactly what's happening right? Example, the Nova spells are not 'removing' any spells from the game yet still adding new spells, options AND not adding button bloat because of how they've set this up. Previous 'bombs' are all one spell now that changes on spec. A passive that makes some of your basic spells 'splash' is another choice(no button bloat, cool game changing ability). Of course, lastly I come to the Nova's which are a new ability, but again being a choice between them and the 'bombs', you don't 'add' buttons while still adding fresh new spells and abilities.<br />
<br />
The only ones that are 'adding' are the new tier of talents, and one of them is a rotation altering passive, not an ability(again, option for those with bloat issues if they tune it right). 4 of the spells shown here were those other 2 choices. <br />
<br />
So, they have simultaneously killed '3 birds' with one stone. Reduced button bloat optionally in the new talent tiers, added new spells, and preserved MANY of the old ones. Is there nothing 'big bad blizzard' can do right in some people's minds?</div></div><hr />

Even worse if it's some open world boss like Ordos with sometimes more than one 40man raid group.<br />

Remember they're going to limit the effects of other people's spells on your screen so it should all work out.</div></div><hr />

Let's be honest, the Frostwolf set looks more like an actual leather set than Monk T17, and has about as much to do with monking.......<br />

Looks leather but it looks nothing like a monk. It has &quot;shaman&quot; written all over it.</div></div><hr />

Right, I know that it looks more shaman than monk. My point is that the frostwolf set looks about as monkish as the actual monk tier - because monk T17 is a mess that hardly looks monk-ish.<br />
<br />
I took a lame opportunity to QQ, basically. Now, back to your regularly scheduled on-topic QQ! ;p</div></div><hr />

It's not because it's wolves it's for shamans. If anything it makes more sense as a hunter, hunters equip the skins of their hunted prey.<br />
<br />
Shaman's wouldn't wear the armor that is skinned from their beloved and sacred wolves.</div></div><hr />

Supernova also looks underwhelming in terms of its effect. As a PVPer I would not replace Frost Nova for that. But then again, the way arcane is going, I'd not use it anyway for that. A shame that what little PVP capability the spec had is being further reduced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the Prismatic Crystal spell looks so odd to me. 'Lorewise', how does a mage hide that massive piece of stone in his/her pockets? And if a mage just 'summons' it instead of carrying it around, why would a mage summon a piece of stone instead of just AoEing the place down?!</div></div><hr />
