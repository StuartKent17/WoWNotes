Cataclysm Raid Progression Refinements<br />
Cataclysm will change a couple of things to the raiding system apparently. &quot;Too long didn't read&quot; version:<br />
<br />
10-Man and 25-Man raids will share the same lockout.<br />
10-Man and 25-Man raids difficulty will be as close as possible to each other. <br />
10-Man and 25-Man raids will drop the exact same loot, but 25-man will drop a higher quantity of items. <br />
Normal versus Heroic mode will be chosen on a per-boss basis in Cataclysm raids, the same way it works in Icecrown Citadel<br />
For the first few raid tiers, our plan is to provide multiple smaller raids. Instead of one raid with eleven bosses, you might have a five-boss raid as well as a six-boss raid.<br />
<br />
We're continuing to refine the raid progression paths in Cataclysm, and we'd like to share some of those changes with you today. Please enjoy!<br />
<br />
The first of the refinements being made is that we're combining all raid sizes and difficulties into a single lockout. Unlike today, 10- and 25-player modes of a single raid will share the same lockout. You can defeat each raid boss once per week per character. In other words, if you wanted to do both a 10- and 25-person raid in a single week, you’d need to do so on two different characters. Normal versus Heroic mode will be chosen on a per-boss basis in Cataclysm raids, the same way it works in Icecrown Citadel. Obviously the raid lockout change doesn't apply in pure Icecrown terms though, as this change goes hand-in-hand with a few other changes to raid progression in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
We're designing and balancing raids so that the difficulty between 10- and 25-player versions of each difficulty will be as close as possible to each other as we can achieve. That closeness in difficulty also means that we'll have bosses dropping the same items in 10- and 25-player raids of each difficulty. They'll have the same name and same stats; they are in fact the exact same items. Choosing Heroic mode will drop a scaled-up version of those items. Our hope is that players will be able to associate bosses with their loot tables and even associate specific artwork with specific item names to a far greater extent than today.<br />
<br />
Dungeon Difficulty and Rewards<br />
10 and 25-player (Normal difficulty) -- Very similar to one another in difficulty; drop the exact same items as each other.<br />
10 and 25-player (Heroic difficulty) -- Very similar to one another in difficulty; drop more powerful versions of the normal-difficulty items.<br />
<br />
We of course recognize the logistical realities of organizing larger groups of people, so while the loot quality will not change, 25-player versions will drop a higher quantity of loot per player (items, but also badges, and even gold), making it a more efficient route if you're able to gather the people. The raid designers are designing encounters with these changes in mind, and the class designers are making class changes to help make 10-person groups easier to build. Running 25-player raids will be a bit more lucrative, as should be expected, but if for a week or two you need to do 10s because half the guild is away on vacation, you can do that and not suffer a dramatic loss to your ability to get the items you want.<br />
<br />
We recognize that very long raids can be a barrier for some players, but we also want to provide enough encounters for the experience to feel epic. For the first few raid tiers, our plan is to provide multiple smaller raids. Instead of one raid with eleven bosses, you might have a five-boss raid as well as a six-boss raid. All of these bosses would drop the same item level gear, but the dungeons themselves being different environments will provide some variety in location and visual style, as well as separate raid lockouts. Think of how you could raid Serpentshrine Cavern and Tempest Keep separately, but you might still want to hit both every week.<br />
<br />
We do like how gating bosses over time allows the community to focus on individual encounters instead of just racing to the end boss, so we’re likely to keep that design moving forward. We don't plan to impose attempt limitations again though, except maybe in cases of rare optional bosses (like Algalon). Heroic mode may not be open from day one, but will become available after defeating normal mode perhaps as little as once or twice.<br />
<br />
In terms of tuning, we want groups to be able to jump into the first raids pretty quickly, but we also don’t want them to overshadow the Heroic 5-player dungeons and more powerful quest rewards. We’ll be designing the first few raid zones assuming that players have accumulated some blue gear from dungeons, crafted equipment, or quest rewards. In general, we want you and your guild members to participate in and enjoy the level up experience.<br />
<br />
We design our raids to be accessible to a broad spectrum of players, so we want groups to be able to make the decision about whether to attempt the normal or Heroic versions of raids pretty quickly. The goal with all of these changes is to make it as much of a choice or effect of circumstance whether you raid as a group of 10 or as a group of 25 as possible. Whether you're a big guild or a small guild the choice won't be dependent on what items drop, but instead on what you enjoy the most.<br />
<br />
We realize that with any changes to progression pathways there are going to be questions. We're eagerly awaiting any that we may have left unanswered. To the comments! <br />
<br />
Extra Information<br />
Here are some clarifications to a few common questions we're seeing.<br />
<br />
Regarding how the raid dungeons will share the same lockout. This means that you cannot do separate instances in the same week. If you defeat an encounter in 10 player normal mode then you are locked to the 10 player mode of that dungeon for that week and can flip between 10 player normal and 10 player heroic on a per boss basis (assuming heroic is available). In this scenario you cannot do the 25 player version. Is this correct?<br />
<br />
Correct. There should be no circumstances under which you kill a boss more than once per week on the same character. However, in the same way that you can decide on a per-boss basis whether to try normal vs. hard mode, we might allow you to change between 10 and 25 on a per-encounter basis for additional flexibility. If you started a raid in 25-player mode and then found that you couldn’t get everyone together later in the week, you might be able to downsize the next few bosses to 10-player.<br />
<br />
Will legendary items be available through 10 player dungeons? How about special mounts like Invincible?<br />
<br />
In some of these specific cases, the answer is that we just don’t know yet. We’re going to have to walk a fine line between dropping the same items in both 10- and 25-player modes, versus still offering something extra for the 25s. If we over-reward the 25s, then players who like 10-player raiding will still feel compelled to find more warm bodies. If we don’t provide any extra incentive for 25s, then some players may stop playing with their friends in order to avoid the extra organization required for a large raid.<br />
<br />
Overall, our goal is that you make the decision between whether to raid with 10 players or 25 players based on what you find fun and not because of the reward structure.<br />
<br />
For perspective, it might help to look back at how we changed lockouts and hard modes on every single raid tier of Wrath of the Lich King to see what felt right and try to fix problems that arose from previous tiers. After seeing the first tier of Cataclysm raiding, we may decide to adjust our design for the next tier.<br />
<br />
How many pieces of loot will drop for 10 and 25 player modes respectively?<br />
<br />
When we say “25 should drop more loot,” we’re just sharing a philosophy. You shouldn’t assume that this means that 10-player modes will drop 1 item or that 25-player modes will drop 6 items, or whatever. We haven’t finalized how much loot will drop, but our general goal is that 25s should drop more to help make up for some of the logistical cost.<br />
<br />
Will achievements be broken down by 10/25 modes? Will realm first achievements/titles be only for 25s? Will meta-achievement mounts be available for both versions still?<br />
<br />
There will just be raid achievements, not 10- vs. 25-player versions in most cases. The achievement won’t care if you complete it in 10s or 25s. If we do meta-achievement mounts, it’s possible we’d still have different colors of mounts, or maybe even different mounts; but for some players that might mean that 25s feels mandatory again, which would be a potential problem. This is the kind of thing we’re going to have to consider carefully, and again, we might try a few different implementations before sticking with something we like.<br />
<br />
We’re also not sure about realm first achievements or titles. We don’t want to encourage, say, 25-player focused guilds to run a 10-player raid instead because they think that will get them the ream first title faster. One potential solution is you can earn a realm first title in 10 or 25, but not both. These types of achievements also serve as great content for guild achievements.</div></div><hr />

I really don't know if gating is the right thing. But at least they take out attempts I think they saw it is a flawed approach. The other changes are great. But there will be sooo much QQ. I see it coming (probably while I write this there are already 20 crying replies)<br />

Hopefully it will help to alleviate raid burnout where you are raiding icecrown two times every single week on the same character such that you are absolutely fed up of the instance within a month or two of raiding.<br />
<br />
The one question that has to be asked though, are they making 10 mans as hard as 25 mans (would be good) or making 25 mans as easy as 10 mans (which would be bad).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bailey09</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being honest here, it is a good idea, but at the same time bad. The whole point of 10/25 man raids where to vary the experience of raiding in terms of difficulty. So unless they manage to pull it off so the HC modes are harder, then good luck to them.<br />
<br />
However, I do like the idea of being able to get the same loot from both difficulties ie. 10+25 and 10HC+25HC. Gives the 10man raids a bigger challenge, yet also the 25mans the reward and obviously a bit more loot, because 2-3 drops a boss in small raids isn't exactly a good use of time for a few people to get upgrades now is it? ;)</div></div><hr />

This will destroy alot of pugs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since i was a little noob in BC, i dreamed of the day where guys like me who haven't the time to find 25 people to always rely on to raid with. Karazhan and ZA were the only things i could do. WotLK came out and i got to experience all the raids with my small guild....now we can finally raid 10 man heroics and be content...thank you blizzard, for catering to the casual players and making the elitist jerks STFU, now we can all raid and feel better about it. This is the best change i have seen to the game since i have played in 3 years, hats off</div></div><hr />

Thats complete Bulls*** this is one of the reasons which i hate about the way wow is going, everyone can get loot, I've been a raider since vanila, whats the point of 25man normal now then? 10man normal will drop the same items? why go 25man when theres less chance of getting loot and a higher chance to fail / wipe?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, thinking about it, it wont.<br />
<br />
If they make 10 and 25 man just as hard, and 25 giving more loot to make it the quicker gearing option, it will be better for the game as a whole.<br />
<br />
10 mans will be able to be tuned in 25 man gear.<br />
<br />
So, think of it like this...<br />
<br />
Instead of:<br />
Run 10 man, learn fights.<br />
Run 25 man with knowing the fights, get gear.<br />
Run 10 man heroic with 25 man gear, making it easy.<br />
Run 25 man heroic knowing fights learned from 10 man.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now:<br />
Run 10/25(Whichever you do.) man.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, this will help burnout from players running 10, 10HM, 25, 25HM each week(In ToC terms, 10 and 25 speaking of ICC)<br />
<br />
<br />
So, as a 25 man(And 40 before that) raider for 4 years, I approve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They aren't making 25man raiding pointless, they are making 10man raids better.<br />
<br />
If you don't have 25 players the 10man mode is not good enough for those who like raiding 25mans.<br />
<br />
People will QQ about this alot, but overall its a big upgrade for atleast half of the WoW community. Just because you can't play 25man raids why should those people have to do the same raid with worse reward?<br />
<br />
I also hope that Realm First! Achievements will work on 10man with this change. I am not sure however if I like Blizz to gate all raid bosses, then it will be hard to get realm first achievements on raids since there is always one guild that goes to the extreme and gets raid together just as a patch hit or stuffs like that.<br />
<br />
Now though, which raid should you do first at level 85 and get realm first achie on? ;P</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is probably doing this to cut the addictivness of the game of some ppl, i think they started doing this in WOTLK for that reason not making as many isntances per patch as before because they were being critisized about it and i think this is ok unless for people who have no life and dont have anything else to do besides wow and if they dont have a life they can make their alts and do it as many times as they want(i dont play much and i ahve 5 80s), anyway it seems a little strange this new system but it doesnt bothe me at all.</div></div><hr />

Woah - same item levels for 10 and 25, just more items to loot from bosses in 25. :o<br />
<br />
*Watches the horizon grow dark with the multitudes of the WoW community carrying pitchforks*<br />
<br />
*Braces for stampede* :-X<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
if they keep it the same, 10m bosses have 2 drops, 25m has 3 drops, 25m guilds will run 10's up until the gating is done then go for endboss. you would get double the loot if you did it this way. 2x3=6 drops from 1 boss a week versus 3x1=3 drops a week.<br />
<br />
bad change is bad.<br />

this is coming from someone who likes 10m better than 25m</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How is there less of a chance to get loot if they drop the same items? Obviously the will just drop 2-3 times as much loot in 25 man, plus the extra badges and monies. <br />
<br />
Think about it this way, 25 mans will stay the same as they are now while 10 mans will get less gold, less badges, and less of a chance to get loot. If both 25 man and 10 man drop the same loot, they must have the same loot table which obviously would be scaled for 25 man or you would have huge loot tables for the 10 man. This means that 10 mans are gonna have a bunch of drops with very very low drop rates to account for the bigger loot table.<br />
<br />
If you have 25 people to raid, it is STILL going to be the best route, just like it is today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So to balance this, today a 10 man drops 2 pieces of loot (so 20% of the party make up), so a 25 man would have to drop 5 pieces of loot and 5 emblems. Otherwise, yeah, 25 man raiding is DEAD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is it exactly only the super hardcore players will raid 25 man. And only for more badges/more loot. To make 25 man viable it has to be an extreme for instance instead of where maybe 10 man has 2 and 25 man has maybe 4-5. It must be like 2 to at least 5-8 pieces of gear otherwise no point. Lets take for instance me(lock) gets into 10 man group i down first boss and 2 pcs drop and 1 badge. Me being only lock (maybe 1 of few caster dps say 2-3) my odds of getting the lets say one piece of caster gear looks pretty good. Lets assume there are 3 bosses 3 ranged dps all bosses drop 1 caster piece we all get one loot i walk away +1. But now lets say we do 25 man and instead of 3 caster dps there are now 11 and ofc 3 cloth healers. Now each boss drops lets say 4 for instance pieces of gear and assume 2 are caster dps. Over 3 bosses that makes 6 items and i roll against 11 ppl my chances of caster gear are cut in half. To do 25 man you would most likely have to guarantee a drop for everyone which in turn means tons and tons of gear drops in 25 man. Which also means bigger loot tables so the idea of getting that one item you really want is extremly hard. I see lots of problems with this system. LOTS</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saviana</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first of the refinements being made is that we're combining all raid sizes and difficulties into a single lockout. Unlike today, 10- and 25-player modes of a single raid will share the same lockout. You can defeat each raid boss once per week per character. In other words, if you wanted to do both a 10- and 25-person raid in a single week, you’d need to do so on two different characters. Normal versus Heroic mode will be chosen on a per-boss basis in Cataclysm raids, the same way it works in Icecrown Citadel. Obviously the raid lockout change doesn't apply in pure Icecrown terms though, as this change goes hand-in-hand with a few other changes to raid progression in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
We're designing and balancing raids so that the difficulty between 10- and 25-player versions of each difficulty will be as close as possible to each other as we can achieve. That closeness in difficulty also means that we'll have bosses dropping the same items in 10- and 25-player raids of each difficulty. They'll have the same name and same stats; they are in fact the exact same items.<br />
<br />
This will kill WoW for sure.<br />
People will get bored because they can't raid and quit the game.<br />

<br />
25 Man raiding will still:<br />
<br />
Bring more loot overall<br />
More Gold<br />
More badges<br />
More chance of wipes/fail<br />
More Accomplishment<br />
More Challenge<br />
<br />
The only difference is now, 10-man raiding is actually worth-while instead of just a filler for gear until the top-end level guilds can achieve better gear.<br />
<br />
Right now, no raider in their right mind would take a peice of gear from ICC10(i251) if they had a (i264) option available from 25 man instead which would obviously be better in comparison.<br />
<br />
Silly people are silly.<br />
<br />
Good change is good. It changes nothing apart from loot. And I'm pretty sure that Top-end Hardcore guilds like Paragon, For The Horde, Ensidia etc would be raiding for the accomplishment and World First still like they have always done.</div></div><hr />

Now, it seems like it'll take longer to get gear.. and people complain.<br />

Let's say...<br />
<br />
A 10 man dropped 2 pieces of gear per boss and 2 emblems (like now).<br />
<br />
and.<br />
<br />
A 25 man dropped 5 pieces of loot and 5 emblems.<br />
<br />
You can only do one a week. Are you really give up on 25 mans? Especially if there is 4 raids with 4-6 bosses apeice in them?<br />
<br />
And to the people complaining about clearing it in 1-2 nights.. did you miss the part about there being more raids in this expansion? Or did you just read one thing that pissed you off and then proceeded to nerdrage about it for 15 minutes?<br />

People complain that 10-man raids aren’t real raiding, it’s just faceroll and all the real men should play in 25-mans.<br />
<br />
Well, one huge reason people think 10-mans are faceroll is because people collect much better gear from the 25-mans and then venture into 10-mans.<br />
<br />
I for one enjoy 10-man raids a lot more than I do with 25-man raids, and I know I’m not alone.<br />
If they scale the difficulty in the new raids correctly, I don’t see any problem at all that they drop same items at same item level.<br />
This way, 10-man raids will no longer be lolfaceroll.</div></div><hr />

In every top server guild there is a really strong core of good players. At this point, since hardcore guilds have a high turnover rate, why bother teaching new people when you can just take your core 10 and stay close together for all of cata, plowing through progression.<br />
<br />
Watch and see, a month after cata hits, hardcore guilds will be splintering like crazy. Everyone will be fumbling around to position themselves into a new 10-man guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW finally very good news :)<br />
<br />
No more need to run 10 player ICC to get THIS Trinket, Offhand whatever. This change will shut down ilvl inflation to a reasonable level again which is a good thing. Also heroic will be even more heroic because you can´t equip so super fast with running additional 10man normal / hero 23 normal ID´s.<br />
<br />
Overall this will make guild raids even more attractive and won´t punish strict 10 man raiding guilds in terms of progression..and thats good.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nemki</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first of the refinements being made is that we're combining all raid sizes and difficulties into a single lockout. Unlike today, 10- and 25-player modes of a single raid will share the same lockout. You can defeat each raid boss once per week per character. In other words, if you wanted to do both a 10- and 25-person raid in a single week, you’d need to do so on two different characters. Normal versus Heroic mode will be chosen on a per-boss basis in Cataclysm raids, the same way it works in Icecrown Citadel. Obviously the raid lockout change doesn't apply in pure Icecrown terms though, as this change goes hand-in-hand with a few other changes to raid progression in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
We're designing and balancing raids so that the difficulty between 10- and 25-player versions of each difficulty will be as close as possible to each other as we can achieve. That closeness in difficulty also means that we'll have bosses dropping the same items in 10- and 25-player raids of each difficulty. They'll have the same name and same stats; they are in fact the exact same items. Choosing Heroic mode will drop a scaled-up version of those items. Our hope is that players will be able to associate bosses with their loot tables and even associate specific artwork with specific item names to a far greater extent than today.<br />
<br />
I think this is just bullshit... This is making 25man raids pointless now.. Having the 10man and 25man raids on the same lockout ID. As well as having them drop the same loot. This is just bullshit way to make the fucking game even easier for the baddies blizzard way to go.</div></div><hr />

Same lockout: don't care really.<br />
Claiming that 10 man can be same difficulty as 25 man: pathetic. thaddius can be 4 manned on 10 man in blues but with the same gear would be a wipe to enrage on 25 man with less than 20.<br />
<br />
<br />
Read the post. They are changing difficulty levels to match. Thaddius might be 4 mannable now. But maybe not so in Cata's era. Stop thinking Wrath = Cata. It fucking isn't. <br />
<br />
<br />
On topic. Seems like a good idea to me. When reading I was getting a little disappointed. Same gear for 10 and 25s? The fuck?! But it will work. And work well. 25 mans certainly will not be dead. If anything, it's 10 mans that are in danger of dying. I'll be taking the 25 man route, if it is the same difficulty but more efficient. More gear, badges and money. <br />
<br />
Ok. You won't be able to do an instance like 4 times in one week. Thank fuck for that. <br />

This change can't be evaluated solo. There are two other changes that WILL affect the raids strongly. Guild leveling and Path of Titans.<br />

Combine this change plus Guild leveling (as you have to be in the guild or you WILL lose all the benefits of it) plus Path of Titans (obviously, it will be affected by raiding) then you can QQ about it.</div></div><hr />

People complain that 10-man raids aren’t real raiding, it’s just faceroll and all the real men should play in 25-mans.<br />
<br />
Well, one huge reason people think 10-mans are faceroll is because people collect much better gear from the 25-mans and then venture into 10-mans.<br />
<br />
<br />
this is exactly why i like this change, no more 25HC guilds facerolling our 10man content with much better gear so that we will finally have a chance to compete for the first 10man server kills :)<br />

Slightly edited, but I think this is what blizzard is going for. I love 25-man raiding but as far as it's concerned the 25-man bosses would need to drop at least 3 times (or 5 pieces vs 2 pieces from 10-man) in order for it to be worth doing. <br />

As in 1 raid of 25 players raiding 1 lockout of a 25 player instance.<br />
<br />
However this statement made absolutly no sense:<br />
<br />
<br />
We do like how gating bosses over time allows the community to focus on individual encounters instead of just racing to the end boss, so we’re likely to keep that design moving forward<br />
I mean like literally no sense what so ever...<br />
How do you focus more on a boss just because there isn't any bosses to kill after him? <br />
<br />
Also it is going to be interesting to see how Blizz try to make 10mans the same difficulty as 25mans. I don't see it ever happening.<br />

<br />
<br />
Actually more like 6+ items and 3+ badges for 2 and 1 in 10 man, otherwise there's literally no point gear wise to go 25 man.<br />
<br />
And you're missing one thing, LK HC 25 difficulty, in HC 10, gonna be so funny, all the whine from the 10 man guilds that won't be able to finish instances ... And LK HC 10 is difficult but nowhere near LK HC 25.<br />
And LK Normal 25 is still a lot harder than LK 10 Normal. Can't wait for the whine.<br />
Basicly nothing will change from now. Just that a guild that is devoted to 10 man, as hardcore as a 25 man guild will be able to reap the same rewards for the same difficulty. You do realize there's no 10 man only guild that has killed LK 10 HC, right?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I do believe it will be a balancing nightmare, there's no way to get them close enough if only because you use the same volume of space to fill with 10 or 25 players (think saurfang, marrowgar, lk defiles and shadow traps, bql bolts etc.).<br />
It's also nice that it will give some players the option of actually doing 10 man raids without always having the 25 man loot as way better. We'll see how successful this is since atm there are no proper 10 man hardcore guilds.</div></div><hr />

Have you ever run 10 mans w/o ever stepping foot in a 25 man to get gear? Like.. running Ulduar 10 with only having obtained Naxx10 and Heroism gear? <br />
<br />
There is a lot less room for error in 10 mans than there are in 25 mans and it's a lot harder to carry people through 10 mans.<br />
<br />
If you're running through ICC10 with a bunch of TogC25 gear, yea.. it's gonna be easy. If you're running through ICC10 with a bunch of ToC10 gear, it gets a little harder.<br />

<br />
Folks who went from 10-man ToC to 10-man ICC did not have the same experience. <br />
<br />
Frankly the problem with 10 mans is losing one person is a big hit. Especially if it's the wrong person. 25-man raids don't feel the loss of one person quite as much (in most fights). It is easier to get 10-people together though, which is why we ran straight 10-man raids for a while.<br />
<br />
I will admit in terms of raid coordination it is easier in 10-man. <br />
<br />
My point is that you must compare what the pure 10-man guilds were doing to the pure 25-man guilds to get an idea of how things will look in Cataclysm. I think you are gonna have a lot of people sticking with 25 man raids just for the epic feel.<br />
<br />
As for making 25 man raids dead... I think people will raid them because they really do feel epic! I said that twice for emphasis!<br />
<br />
Also look at it this way. If you are a 25 man raider who doesn't have time for 10-mans but feels like you have to go to get such-and-such trinket... blizzard is saving you time!</div></div><hr />

Sure, they may not get quite as much loot per person, but they can kill more bosses to make up for that, and those later bosses will probably have better gear anyway (and they will have a better chance at hardmodes too).<br />

<br />
Don't doubt whether or not blizzard can make hard 10man content. Given 10man gear, sarth 3D, firefighter, algalon, H LK are pretty much all as challenging as 25man content if not more. The problem is that I can totally see an end boss on 10man is easier than an end boss on 25 man or the other way around, which will force A LOT of guilds do the easier version for loot. That defeats the whole purpose of &quot;choosing the raid style you enjoy&quot; idea.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, why not just go back to making certain raids only available in 10-man versions. Like how Kara was. But 25-mans should still be where you wanna be. This change to make 10mans better will slowly destroy 25mans. Why carry 10 bad players through when you can group with 9 good players and get the same gear?</div></div><hr />

When I first read this I was a little pissed until I finished the article. I think it's a good idea to have em on the same lock out since they will be dropping the same gear. I also love the idea of two smaller raid instances instead of one giant one. I know a lot of people have been and will continue to QQ over this saying that their precious 25m raids are going down the shitter but if you'd l2r you'll see they are still providing incentive to 25m raid. More loot drops per boss, more g, and more badges (meaning faster tier and vendor gear which will still drive your oh so precious gear score up higher than a 10m raiding guild). That being said, how does that make 25m obsolete? Esp when they said they are going to tune th raids to have the same amount of strain on the group whether you're in 10m or 25m. (meaning 10m won't be a walk in the park.. and if it is, than so will 25m)</div></div><hr />

<br />
25 Man raiding will still:<br />
<br />
Bring more loot overall<br />
More Gold<br />
More badges<br />
More chance of wipes/fail<br />
More Accomplishment<br />
More Challenge<br />
<br />
The only difference is now, 10-man raiding is actually worth-while instead of just a filler for gear until the top-end level guilds can achieve better gear.<br />
<br />
Right now, no raider in their right mind would take a peice of gear from ICC10(i251) if they had a (i264) option available from 25 man instead which would obviously be better in comparison.<br />
<br />
Silly people are silly.<br />
<br />
Good change is good. It changes nothing apart from loot. And I'm pretty sure that Top-end Hardcore guilds like Paragon, For The Horde, Ensidia etc would be raiding for the accomplishment and World First still like they have always done.<br />

<br />
Have you ever run 10 mans w/o ever stepping foot in a 25 man to get gear? Like.. running Ulduar 10 with only having obtained Naxx10 and Heroism gear? <br />
<br />
There is a lot less room for error in 10 mans than there are in 25 mans and it's a lot harder to carry people through 10 mans.<br />
<br />
If you're running through ICC10 with a bunch of TogC25 gear, yea.. it's gonna be easy. If you're running through ICC10 with a bunch of ToC10 gear, it gets a little harder.<br />
<br />
Whatever, let the mediocre elitists rage and (not)quit the game. I'll just start ignoring their posts.<br />

<br />
I'm doing 10 man HCs on alts with just 10 man / 10 man HC / badge gear. Trust me, you can carry 1-2 bads all the way as long as it's not tanks or healers and the other dps can actually push the right buttons at the right time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as lockouts, thats not really too bad considering they are essentially going to be the same encounter, 25m just drops a few more items, tho if they do break the raids up into smaller raids then there should still be plenty to do in a single lockout period.</div></div><hr />

I like how the 10 and 25 man's are now, although I prefer the Ulduar style of hardmodes, instead of turn on a switch to make it heroic. Fights like Vezax, you couldn't use any of the green puddles to activate hardmode.<br />

<br />
It is clearly stated that people who are capable of mustering the players for 25s will be rewarded by faster loot acquisition. One can only assume (using basic reasoning and comprehension skills) that this means more loot per player per boss. In other words, a boss on 10 will probably still drop 2 purps. The same boss on 25 will probably drop 6 purps. <br />
<br />
This is in contrast to the current setup whereby 25s drop 3 purps of higher quality. The current 25-man purp-to-player ratio is less than that of 10-man raids, per boss kill.<br />
<br />
I think this is a fantastic idea. I am uncertain about my feelings toward gated encounters, but I am all for unifying 10 and 25 locks. Here's hoping that all of the people QQing over these changes can find it in their hearts to ragequit ASAP.</div></div><hr />

1) No longer have to farm the same instance twice/four times (ToC anyone). More like TBC raiding then anything else, hopefully Blizz will pull through on difficulty levels beimng adjusted.<br />
<br />
2) Item inflation byebye. Now they needed 232-245-258 for one instance (251-264-277 for ICC). Now, we will only see two levels of items. Problem was that gear from the last tier was being replaced way fast, with limited badges, and relatively little difference in gear in the new set-up we won't face silly stuff such as chill of the Throne/Sunwell Radiance.<br />
<br />
3) People can play the format they like. <br />
<br />
4) Drops the silly format of hardcore guilds running 10mans first to get the ropes of a fight etc (and gear up from it aswelll I reckon), before tackling the 25man version.<br />
<br />
I can see how people are afraid of 10mans giving the same gear, but I think the real challenge will remain in 25mans anyway, but now 25man guilds won;t overgear 10man content (making server firsts 10man cooler), and a 10man player can more easily switch to a 25man guild (making recruiting easier). <br />

Let me address some of the QQ:<br />
&quot;This will kill hardcore guilds&quot;<br />
-Obviously you think hardcore is normal modes. Hardcore guilds will still be doing hard modes.<br />
&quot;They are making the game more casual&quot;<br />
-By making top tier badges take more time to obtain? By making the best loot available only to those guilds that can do the hard versions? By increasing the quantity of loot for guilds that take the time to form a 25 man? Okay.<br />
&quot;25 man guilds will die&quot;<br />
-Not SMART 25 man guilds that don't stand in fire. Read the news again, the amount of drops (including more badges and gold) per boss will be scaled appropriately for 25 man version. You get top tier badges faster by doing the bigger raids. You will get more drops. This is incentive for non-lazy guilds that have members with half a brain.<br />
<br />
Anyways, can't wait for the kiddies to emo-quit WoW over this, more breathing space for the rest of us.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trilog</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is really good news. seems like a return to TBC's raiding but more refined. now you can't just run both player versions and gear up instantly. it doesn't necessarily kill 25 mans though because more badges + more items = faster gearing up. I suspect the amount of 25 raids done will diminish severely, though. <br />
<br />
while great news, this isn't my biggest concern with raiding. my biggest concern is badges. they're great in theory, but executed so poorly. I came back to WoW when the LK encounter was about to be released, leveled to 80, ran heroics and all that. thing is there was only 3 raids to even run. onyxia, ToC (easily the WORST RAID EVER) and ICC. all the content before like Naxx, Ulduar and Sarth/Maly simply don't matter anymore because the items from badges give far superior loot. sad part is Ulduar is one of the best looking raids that I've seen. this gaping flaw needs to be fixed with Cataclysm. make badges give the lowest ilevel or only a handful of higher ilevel epics. to play devil's advocate, every guild being focused on ICC opens up more opportunities to players but where is the epic feeling of gearing up? where is the epic feeling of progressing through every instance? obviously I understand the badge loot was a move towards more casual players but damnit I wanted to run Uld D:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lordsarmy</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off:<br />
We need to know exactly how much more loot 25 man will drop. Because.. OF COURSE 25 man HAS TO DROP MORE.. there are 25 people to split the loot with. So.. if 10 man drops 2 pieces and 25 man drops 5 pieces.. thats no advantage.. 25/5 is the same as 10/2<br />
<br />
So for there to be any advantage at all in running 25 mans bosses will have to drop AT LEAST 6 pieces of gear and even then it will only be a small advantage. <br />
<br />
So will it be 1 pieces of loot on 10 man, 4 on 25 man&gt;? (Probably not because 1 pieces on 10 man is stupid) or will it be 2 pieces on 10 man and 6 or 7 on 25 man&gt; (Seems like WAY too much loot for 25 man) Or will it be 2 pieces on 10 and 4 or 5 on 25 man (making 25 man raids be pointless)? <br />
<br />
None of those options are good.<br />
<br />
So basically to sum up this news:<br />
All players who raid only 10 mans, or have always wanted to just play with 9 other friends are very very excited today because they can now get the best loot in the game with out having to work to fill a raid.<br />
<br />
All players who do 25 man raids feel slightly betrayed.. aren't really sure what to think of this. They either think &quot;well at least I wont have to raid twice a week&quot; but at the same time think &quot;well shoot.. whats the point of putting up with 24 people when I can just get 9 friends and end up with the same stuff&quot;?<br />
<br />
So.. for me.. Im not ready to jump to any conclusions.. my gut reaction is that this is really really stupid on the part of Blizzard.. after all there is a reason that EVERY TIME it has been brought up in the past.. they have said somthing along these lines &quot;We recognize that there is a higher degree if dificulty in brining 25 players together and being coordinated&quot; and have flatly said &quot;NO&quot; when asked why 10 mans didnt have access to legendaries.<br />
<br />
OHHHHHHHHHHH.. just thought of a great question.. WILL 10 MANS HAVE ACCESS TO LEGNEDARIES NOW? If thats the case there is no way in hell you can tell me 25 mans have an advantage.. because your chances of ever landing a legendary go WAY up with only 10 people.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow.. wierd wierd day.. this may in fact (depending on how it plays out of course) lead to me not raiding any more. (after 5 1/2 years)<br />

What people hear is that -Oh no, now we only get 1 raid in each raid every week<br />
The thing you should pay focus to is that they say they plan to make more raids with smaller amount of bosses, which would make it a pain in the ass to have 10man +25man and maybe 3 diffrent raids to go to.<br />
This is for sure a great change to people who raid in guilds cause we now can spend more time irl than by the crap computer to try to get a pug together to get a certain trinket that someones alt will snatch or a raid that ends after first whipe on a boss.<br />
Hopefully we will see 3-4 raids each tier (Would be so awesome!)<br />
<br />
And hopefully we will end up happier not going to a pug where it ends at second boss cause 2 ppl left.<br />
<br />
This is first realy awesome part about cataclysm, for me atleast! Keep this good news coming!</div></div><hr />

So say a boss drops 2 pieces in 10 man, thats 1/5. The same boss will have to drop 5 pieces in 25 to keep the 1/5. So, doing a 10 man raid with 6 bosses would be 12 drops in 10 man and 30 in 25. <br />
<br />
If you do two 10 man groups you're losing out on a piece of loot per boss. So over the course of 4 weeks with two raids that equal eleven bosses you'd get 88 single 10 man, 220 in 25 man and if you did two 10 mans it would only come to 176 which is a loss of 44 pieces of loots.<br />
<br />
To me that seems like far from the death of 25 mans.</div></div><hr />

Well put. <br />
<br />
I've always enjoyed 10M raiding far more than 25M. It may not feel as 'epic' or w/e but, its just feels like you're actually doing something. Anyways, I like this change. I've never known why the 'real raiders' had to to 25M, simply because it dropped better gear. Also, how is not wanting to find 15 additional people make someone/a guild 'casual'?

<br />
25 Man raiding will still:<br />
<br />
Bring more loot overall<br />
More Gold<br />
More badges<br />
More chance of wipes/fail<br />
More Accomplishment<br />
More Challenge<br />
<br />
The only difference is now, 10-man raiding is actually worth-while instead of just a filler for gear until the top-end level guilds can achieve better gear.<br />
<br />
Right now, no raider in their right mind would take a peice of gear from ICC10(i251) if they had a (i264) option available from 25 man instead which would obviously be better in comparison.<br />
<br />
Silly people are silly.<br />
<br />
Good change is good. It changes nothing apart from loot. And I'm pretty sure that Top-end Hardcore guilds like Paragon, For The Horde, Ensidia etc would be raiding for the accomplishment and World First still like they have always done.<br />
<br />
<br />
about that filler gear ilvl 251 vs ilvl 264 is just crap, before Blizz made the interface change so u could see the Ilvl and that shit addon gearscore came to place ppl could eazy change gear to lower Ilvl becouse it had better stats for your specc! all since those changes all 80% of the wow community has gone GS mad wich are just silly cuz the addon SUCK!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the boss drops say 3 times the badges and loot, you've actually got better chances of winning something.<br />
<br />
<br />
QFT, also this is probably be EXACTLY what Blizzard is planning to do, atleast i hope so. (so 10man are 2 items and 2 badges per boss and 25mans 6 items and 6 badges per boss) and that makes 25man raiding ALOT more than viable. I can't see any &quot;hardcore&quot; guild (such as paragon for example) doing 10mans if you get badges 3x faster in 25man, and gear a little bit faster too, with higher chances of it not going to DE/OS, but straight upgrades.</div></div><hr />

10 mans and 25 mans sharing the same lockout is the best thing that ever happened to WoW. This is what I was hoping for a long time but didn't believe it would actually be implemented.<br />
<br />
The thing that half the guild saw the places and encounters in 10 man before the others in 25 man was so freaking lame. The current system also encourages and nearly forces you to raid till you burn out.<br />

There tend to be better and worse players in a 25 man group. The better ones are going to realize that they can get better loot (from doing later bosses in a raid), by just doing a 10 man with the best folks. Sure, they may not get quite as much loot per person, but they can kill more bosses to make up for that, and those later bosses will probably have better gear anyway (and they will have a better chance at hardmodes too).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nienor</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple facts :<br />
<br />
1) 25 man raids &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 man raids in difficulty no matter what. It's simple maths. 10 people are much easier to coordinate and work together than 25. <br />
<br />
2) Encounter complexity in 10 man will always be lower than that of a 25 man unless they dumb down the 25man content.<br />
<br />
3) Gold in wow doesn't matter anymore, so even if a boss drops 100g more for each one in raid (which wont happen imo) it would still be useless.<br />
<br />
4) Unless they make 25 man bosses drop 3x more items than 10 man, 25mans will die. Simple math again. It would be much better for a guild to run 2x10 man raids than 1x25 since people will get more loots MUCH easier.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, what they should do is:<br />
<br />
1) Have 10 man version of a raid available that will drop random - non-tier, low quality epics for those who don't care about loots etc and they just want to raid casually and experience the fights - lore etc. <br />
<br />
2) Have only one version of the 25man raid available. No heroic difficulty and such failed crap. Just one version that will be challenging enough for those who have the patience and will to fight at a higher level. Ofc the rewards should be appropriate to that level of difficulty. <br />
<br />
This way everyone would be happy. Both casuals, who dont care for items or challenge or anything like that and they just want to log in smash some stuff and log out, and the more &quot;hardcore&quot; who enjoy the most challenging content and they just feel like suckers when they see that the game rewards the same those who try more and those who don't even try at all.</div></div><hr />

I used to raid very seriously. I have nothing against people who don't want to put in &gt;20 hours a week wiping only on the 25 man versions of the raid content, but if they really remove anything but the most superficial differences between 10/25 and 10HC/25HC raids, I have trouble seeing that as anything but what I can only hope to be the zenith of Activision-Blizzard's ingratiation with the wide mainstream.

<br />
<br />
my point was more aimed at middle of the road raiders like myself, why be in that 25 man guild that makes you hate life because its the only way to get the 25 man loot to do the next Teir of raiding or progress when you can now just make a smaller, nicer guild to develop, abeit at a slower rate than the 25 man &quot;Sword champions of the sword&quot; or w/e you just left, It wont kill &quot;hardcore&quot; 25 guilds like Paragon etc, but I can see alot of the less... god I hate these words &quot;casual&quot; raiders Sloging there guts in the big wanna be hardcore guilds when they just wanna play with friends.<br />
<br />
As you said mind, no big time guild will do 10s for current content. Apart from your fine point about PotT and guild talents, theres also the fact you can get away with alot more slack/DCs/Fail/Bad RNG, stack more Battle reses, have a larger mix of classes and buffs etc in a 25 man raid than a much smaller 10 man, if anything the 10s might punish mistakes alot worse as long as they bump up the difficulty from its current faceroll state.<br />
<br />
Still think its a good change and not the world ender alot of people seem to think it is</div></div><hr />

Strict 10 man Raiding shall prevail!<br />

<br />
wasnt the attraction of strict 10man raiding clearing the content in the gear provided (i.e. 10man gear)?<br />
<br />
how can you call yourselves a strict 10man guild qhen you arent just 'basically' wearing 25man gear as you are now. you simply ARE wearing 25man gear, just getting it slower than a guild that runs 25man content.<br />
<br />
the attraction of different raid sizes should be mechanic and playerskill based, where losing 1 player drastically affects your raid. <br />
<br />
<br />
OT:this whole thing makes very little sense. players who invest a lot of effort into this game will be reduced to a 1/2 day raiding week without 10mans, coupled with shit gating again. i cant grasp how someone came up with the idea of ' lets make this game more fun by making people play less'</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deos</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unlike today, 10- and 25-player modes of a single raid will share the same lockout. <br />
<br />
We're designing and balancing raids so that the difficulty between 10- and 25-player versions of each difficulty will be as close as possible to each other as we can achieve. That closeness in difficulty also means that we'll have bosses dropping the same items in 10- and 25-player raids of each difficulty. <br />
<br />
What.. The.. F...<br />
<br />
Bye 25man raiding. <br />
No, extra loot-per-raider wont change that. No, extra challenge of managing 25 people wont make it any &quot;cooler&quot; if reward and difficulty is exactly the same. Extra gold? Don't make me f'n laugh &gt;.&lt; Nobody even care about gold in this game not to say raid for it, it is stupid.<br />
<br />
Also 10man ans 25 separate lock provided many players with additional option to raid besides prime guild raid time, because simply they want to play more than that and to play with a different group of people, a closer group of friends usually, but they dont wanna just shift to 10man tier completely. This is bullsh*t i tell you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dakalro</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great changes.<br />
<br />
1) No longer have to farm the same instance twice/four times (ToC anyone). More like TBC raiding then anything else, hopefully Blizz will pull through on difficulty levels beimng adjusted.<br />
<br />
2) Item inflation byebye. Now they needed 232-245-258 for one instance (251-264-277 for ICC). Now, we will only see two levels of items. Problem was that gear from the last tier was being replaced way fast, with limited badges, and relatively little difference in gear in the new set-up we won't face silly stuff such as chill of the Throne/Sunwell Radiance.<br />
<br />
3) People can play the format they like. <br />
<br />
4) Drops the silly format of hardcore guilds running 10mans first to get the ropes of a fight etc (and gear up from it aswelll I reckon), before tackling the 25man version.<br />
<br />
I can see how people are afraid of 10mans giving the same gear, but I think the real challenge will remain in 25mans anyway, but now 25man guilds won;t overgear 10man content (making server firsts 10man cooler), and a 10man player can more easily switch to a 25man guild (making recruiting easier). <br />
<br />
I am stoked, shame that other people have to worry about their epeen (higher ilevel zomg for 25man raiders!!!!!) being taken away.<br />
<br />

<br />
This is overall 10 man rankings:<br />

This is 10 man only rankings:<br />

<br />
Notice the gap? Add more difficulty in 10 man, gap increases, most of the current 10 man guilds will vanish since they're not exactly guilds, just too lazy to organize. The upside, there will be more 10 man guilds focused solely on 10 man, downside, free 10 man loot is gone, after the first 1-2 bosses in instances, a lot harder to get decent people to PuG (why would I bother taking my alts to a 10 man when I can get 15 guildies and 10 randoms and destroy 25 man?). I for one welcome the bonus of not having to play 8 instances for 4 characters every week (or a retarded 14 in TotC).</div></div><hr />

Nice 1 lockout for a raid, pure sh**. When a raid will be on a farm and you clear it in 1 night, then you can't do anything more for the next 6 days. Casuals will be happy even more. Oh right I was forgetting they claimed there will be more raids with the same iLvL's gear with few bosses, well, hardcore guilds will clear them all in 1 night too. Cool after 3-4 night on progressing in a 25-man and you want to go and relax in a 10-man, you can't. Well at least it won't happen soon since raids will be on progress and top/hardcore guilds will rush as much as possible, oh wait, I forgot about gating content. But wait I'd be happy about 25-man bosses drop more loots rather than 10man and GOLDZ AND EMBLUMZ!!111!<br />
But I'd thanks Blizzard because now I can raid in summer with people on vacation 10-mans and still get the same loot as I'd raid 25-mans. Again Blizzard think this game is about loot and totally forget that out there there are serious raiders that wait a new istance to see new bosses, racing against others to get first kills and so on, but no of course they don't care.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because, 25-man raids are not really more difficult than 10-mans, but have vastly superior gear. In other words, whoever has access to 25-man raids will outgear 10-mans while/before progressing it. In 25-mans, it's also much easier to get carried, effectively turning some bad players into well geared players and some other good players into lesser geared players. <br />
<br />
25-man raiding will (hopefully) still be desireble as you get more rewards in terms of badges and gold, there may even be rewards from the upcoming revamped guild system.</div></div><hr />

Right now, we have people walking into 10 man ICC in 245 gear, face rolling it, getting geared from it and then taking on 25m. By the time a lot of hard core players reach encounters they overgear the encounter and thus it's easy. Sure, I'd like to see these same people who claim ICC is so easy walk in there at a 4700-4800GS (i.e. 232 gear nearly exclusively) and do so well. It won't happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
25 man boss - 5 drops 3 emblem<br />
10 man boss - 2 drops 1 emblem<br />

That's literally the exact same amount of loot per boss/per person. The only thing your getting in your scenario is more gold and emblems. Not sure that's enough motivation to do 25 mans.<br />
<br />
To truly be &quot;more&quot;, it would have to be 6 loot per boss.</div></div><hr />

Yeah screw people who prefer the face passed epic feel of 25 man raids in favour of the slow, watered down 10man guilds@@@@@@@@@!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Honestly the only people here being selfish jerks are 10man guilds. With 10/25 lockouts you get your 10man raids to enjoy and 25man raids enjoyed by 25man guilds. This is just you guys being little selfish kids butthurt because you can have 264 level items like those mean old 25 man raiders.<br />

<br />
As you said mind, no big time guild will do 10s for current content. Apart from your fine point about PotT and guild talents, theres also the fact you can get away with alot more slack/DCs/Fail/Bad RNG, stack more Battle reses, have a larger mix of classes and buffs etc in a 25 man raid than a much smaller 10 man, if anything the 10s might punish mistakes alot worse as long as they bump up the difficulty from its current faceroll state.<br />
<br />
Still think its a good change and not the world ender alot of people seem to think it is<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, but both Guild Leveling and Path of Titans don't work on a ladder system. It's basically leveling, everyone has the shot to get to the top. The best ones will get there first.<br />
<br />
Item level as &quot;merit&quot; reward is gone, when we combine all three changes. Cataclysm will be about guild pride, not player pride.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally me and my guild are liking this idea. Usually we haunt the 25 man raids and will still be having 25 man wipe-fests in Cataclysm Heroics. However as a guild of working adults, sometimes Real Life gets in the way. We have had way too many nights where our 25 man teams (we have enough players and alts to have a couple of raid teams) are sidelined because some players have to work late, are stuck on the local motorway/autobahn/train, have a sick kid, etc. Come Cataclysm, we will not be wasting time twiddling our thumbs, we can just run a ten man team and get the same gear/badges if only not as much of it. Plus having multiple raid instances to choose from will help us. <br />
<br />
We are generally hard core when it comes to raiding (we cut our raiding teeth during Vanilla on ZG, AQ20, MC and Onyxia), however we also understand that shit happens and we have to adjust. This change makes that adjustment much easier to do.<br />
<br />
Now time to sit back and watch the QQ Express roll on.<br />

<br />
Absolutely HATE the thing about 10man and 25man sharing the same lockout.<br />
Right now we're doing 10man in the guild and 25man with a raid alliance. Most of our 10man guys are in the 25man raid, but not all of them. Also we're more successfull in the 10man (couple sucky people in the 25man unfortunately). Now we will have to decide whether to leave the 25man raid alliance and do 10man exclusively, create two or more 10man raids (possibly mix each week) in the raid alliance and switch to doing multiple 10mans instead of one 25man (and possible switch back and forth depending on the amount of people able to raid this week). etc. Maybe some guys in our guild prefer the 25man, others prefer the 10man so we'll split.<br />
<br />
This fucking sucks, pretty sure it'll ruin our guild....</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">esoh</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me this change absolutely blows.<br />
<br />
I'm not all fussed about the difficulty being easier/harder either as I'm sure they'll balance this appropriately, but I far prefer the environment in our 10-man group over that of our 25's. <br />
<br />
Being in a 25-man focused guild our guild is going to be obviously taking that route and continue in such, thus eliminating our 10-man groups. I far prefer the environment in our 10-man group over that of our 25's for several reasons:<br />
- I get along with all the people in my 10man, whereas I don't my 25's.<br />
- The skill level is all very high in our 10man, and again differs in our 25's where we have to carry people.<br />
- Raiding 10man doesn't feel like a chore as I actually look forward to it, whereas 25man it does.<br />
<br />
Due to the above factors, the attitude towards raiding is increased and is far more enjoyable for myself and the rest of the group. <br />
<br />
Obviously, it could be said to go find a 10-man guild and be done with it, but I'm happy in my current guild and I don't want a different one.<br />
<br />
Pretty much this change will kill 10-man raiding in our guild and that is what I enjoy the most, so for me and I'm sure many others in this situation, the change is horrible.</div></div><hr />

It needed to be done because it was never clear what being a good 10 man raider meant. You didn't get the same loot so you must be less skilled as a raider? Even though there are some encounters that are actually more difficult with less people because of less healers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bad because they need to just kill 25 mans completely and let the fallout come. They would be pretty irrelevant at this point. I know people are going to explode with this news and it will be a complete shit storm, but how many times have you had a 25 man fall apart because some guy didn't show up, or keep getting d/c'ed, or your guild just doesn't comfortably have 25 people up for a raid on an average night. <br />
<br />
The difficulty of an encounter should not be keeping 25 people on the same page, but each person's skill and understanding of their class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good:<br />
<br />
Less raiding to one character. If you wanna raid the entire week, this forces you to gear up and prepare other characters... mmm alts becoming nearly mains... I dig that.<br />
<br />
10 mans becoming preparation and practice for the 25 mans to gear the whole raid/guild. I think were going with the attempts strategy of the hardcore guilds (lvling alts similar to their mains to get practices and not wasting attempts or in this case, bosses). I like it.<br />
<br />
25 mans are NOT gonna die. they will become a more enjoyable experience overall.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bad:<br />
<br />
Balancing nightmare which will take weeks / months to get right. ( Hope beta gets it right.)<br />
<br />
Those with only one player, are screwed. They might as well prepare to level another to keep their raiding experience intact.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axelhander</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple facts :<br />
<br />
I'm going to enjoy tearing this apart with actual reason. ;D<br />
<br />
<br />
1) 25 man raids &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 man raids in difficulty no matter what. It's simple maths. 10 people are much easier to coordinate and work together than 25. <br />
<br />
Wrong at worst, misguided at best. Raid rewards are individual rewards (i.e., they don't just apply to raid dungeons and they don't stop working if you leave a guild). The individual challenge of a given encounter, therefore, is the measure of what constitutes a fitting reward. Individual challenge is not inherently larger in a bigger group, and you couldn't prove it so if your life depended on it. Blizzard couldn't even do it, despite preaching nonsense, and they're finally seeing that.<br />
<br />
You can design a 1-man encounter with more individual challenge than a 40-man encounter, or a 40-man encounter with more individual challenge than a 10-man encounter, or any variant. Your claim is bogus and not indicative of &quot;simple math.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Encounter complexity in 10 man will always be lower than that of a 25 man unless they dumb down the 25man content.<br />
<br />
Wrong, for reasons already stated.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Gold in wow doesn't matter anymore, so even if a boss drops 100g more for each one in raid (which wont happen imo) it would still be useless.<br />
<br />
Bullshit argument supported by zero backing evidence = you're an imbecile. Provide empirical evidence showing this will impact the value of gold in-game. Do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Unless they make 25 man bosses drop 3x more items than 10 man, 25mans will die. Simple math again. It would be much better for a guild to run 2x10 man raids than 1x25 since people will get more loots MUCH easier.<br />
<br />
That's probably the plan, but we'll have to see.<br />
<br />
<br />
In my opinion, what they should do is:<br />
<br />
Never become a game designer. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

There is nothing wrong with this, This changes 0 for a Hard Core Guild (makes it easier now that you can still raid if your short on your 25 man HM)<br />
<br />
Casuals that RAID WELL will love it as well.<br />
<br />
Only people complaining are MMO-C Whiners/Babies, Bad casuals, and asshats who just argue so they can.<br />

People really seem to dismiss hardmodes. The hardcore guilds are the only one who really utilize them when they are relevant to the &quot;world/realm-firster&quot; crowd. So really, expect the changes to be more natural than you think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pros: <br />
<br />
- Less complication in the loot pravado of we must run 10 mans as well as 25 per week because some BiS items drops in 10 man Heroic. Lets face it. I love 25 man raiding but I don't want to be hassled all the time with a 10 man raiding. Not that I don't enjoy the 10 mans I love that as well but it is better to focus on One. <br />
- Altoholic love. I have a lot of a alts and I wish to be able to gear them up. This means I can easily make 10 man runs with alts and gain some good equipment on them with the added free time I will have per week. If you don't have or like alts well sux 2 be u!<br />
- I love the fact we get more instances. I'm easily all for 5 bosses per raid with new scenery, style, features, and feel. Than 12 bosses of the same shit all week long. <br />
- No more raid canceled for 25 man groups. For some reason a lot of players suddenly need to go on break or its vacation time like chrismas. Why cancel a raid when you can just make 10 mans and go. <br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
<br />
- Uniqueness is dying. Lets face it this began the moment we hit WoTLK. To me I hate how they made PvE stuff easily acquirable and less unique compared to PvP. When I wear my raiding gear I like to stand out a little. People recognize that this dude raids heroic instances and that is hard earned gear. I don't want people to just look like the guy next to me that simply grinded the badges for it. Give a player some Epeen so to speak &gt;.&gt;<br />
- No fix for difficulty factor. <br />
<br />
Suggestions:<br />
<br />
- Reverse the gating system. Make it heroic available only to give the hardcore players an advantage over casuals. Giving them a chance to gain the lead and recognition they deserve. Then unlock normal mode by time. This means players will be able to catch up to the hardcore players. <br />
- You made 10/25 man loot the same? Fine.. Make Normal vs Heroic Look different. I don't mean just recoloring I mean make it look a bit more badass. Best example is Teir 7 vs t7.5 and PvP gear. Lower teir looks meh, higher tear looks badass (some may argue but this is pure for example sake)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
E.G., keeping the &quot;Legendary Quest Items&quot; in 25 man raids yet the loot remains similar throughout. There needs to be at least some motivation for 25 man content, besides a giant achievement for you. Idk, maybe achievement mounts will be confined to 25 mans but it still seems silly to me.</div></div><hr />

Look at WotLK as an example: epic items between 200 and 284, but without the extra level of gear every content patch added by 10mans we'd probably be down somewhere around 245-251. It is much easier to create and tune encounters when there's a better known incoming gear level.

You can have a handful of dps and a few healers and maybe even a tank die in a 25 man, if you lose more than 1 or 2 people in a 10 man, you will generally wipe (unless its in like the last 5% or so) Yea 25 mans are harder in spacing people out and range check, but thats why we have range checkers. And lets be real honest, is raiding anywhere near hard regardless of 10 or 25man? This is also gonna hurt things like VoA. Soon they might as well say &quot;You've done a 25man raid of some sort this week, you cant raid anything else&quot;.

<br />
based on personal experiance of the current system:<br />
<br />
i liked 10 man a lot (as a member of a 25 man raiding guild), it was a bit more laid back and social (lots of good laughs) and a good practice area for learning hands on with mechanics.<br />
<br />
that said our RL did conive to take his &quot;dream team&quot; to 10s as much as possible every reset which put many noses out of joint..<br />
<br />
i dunno guess it makes some kind of sense but personally i will miss the having the option of a more social and less serious 10 man reset existing parallel to the more serious 25 man one.<br />

I'm surprised by the amount of people that seem to have played Cataclysm already and are rather knowledgeable regarding the new 10man difficulty! <br />
<br />
Gonna have to wait and see how this turns out I guess, but Blizzard have probably learned a lot from the past couple expansions. This seems like a good way of merging tbc with wotlk raid styles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just have to say: fuck yes.<br />
<br />
About time they did this. Thank you, Blizzard. Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i wish a raid like ulduar could be brought back as that raid was pretty much the best raid in the game .fullstop. <br />
<br />
There idea isto string out the raid for aslong as possible. can be acheived like this .... ulduar final encounter was beaten months after realease ..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes that's right.<br />
<br />
Those selfish 25man raiders! I can't believe they actually want an advantage to raiding 25mans!<br />
<br />
Those 10 man raiders, totally not selfish at all and just nice guys. They just want to see all the content and get the best purples in easy, slow, watered down raids!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, the irony and arrogance of 10man raiders is blinding.</div></div><hr />

Smaller guilds and PUGs will likely stick with 10-mans, because they'll be easier to organize. I really don't see a downside to this announcement.</div></div><hr />
