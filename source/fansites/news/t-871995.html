Mione had a busy week after the Solo kill of Yogg-Saron and decided to visit the Trial of the Crusader instance.  
 
The Twin Val'kyrs are pretty fast to kill apparently but the Faction Champions are ... well ... longer ... much longer ... in fact, it took almost 2 hours to kill them. Congratulations to Mione, and good luck for the solo kill of the Lich King.

Karazhan Map in Patch 4.1<br />
Patch 4.1 updated most of the TBC dungeon with new world maps (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2209-Death-Knight-Solo-Yogg-Saron-Patch-4.1-Updated-TBC-Maps-MMO-Report-Daily-Blink) but so far the dungeons with a lot of floors (Black Temple/Karazhan) were missing. The latest PTR build added Karazhan maps and you can now check out how the 17 floors look from above. <br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
New SSDs (http://www.anandtech.com/show/4159/ocz-vertex-3-pro-preview-the-first-sf2500-ssd) are finally showing up, faster and more expensive than the current generation. Currently they are overpriced (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Q81CKY?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004Q81CKY) because they are new, look for price reductions over the next few weeks. New AMD CPUs are unlikely to surface before June or July.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

<br />
The only things 1366 has as a major advantage over the new 1155 is more pci lanes and recent tests have shown that they only really matter in tri or quad sli/cfx setups, the other thing is another memory lane - which might matter in certain intensive memory access situations (server like processing i believe...), but certainly does not in ordinary situations<br />
In gaming setups (which we clearly must accept that this is), the i7 2600K outperforms the older i7 950 by far - simply because its the 2nd generation of the architecture. In fact, only the 980 XE and 990 XE can outperform an i7 2600K in terms of gaming. <br />
On top of this comes the 2600K's superior (and simplified) OC capabilities. Reviewers reached stable 5ghz OCs on air - stating that anyone by simply upping the multiplier could reach 4,6-4,8. <br />
<br />
Oh, and its a fair bit cheaper.</div></div><hr />

WThen feel free to do it on your death knight and submit a video to prove how easy the task is. Better yet submit a Yogg Saron solo kill video for everyone to see.</div></div><hr />

Your name is dookieguy1039 and you are telling me whats what? I lol'd, but I'll humor you. Only fanboys and dumbasses who cannot think of a better comeback say &quot;you're jealous lol&quot;. Fact of the matter is, its true. Any Death Knight who forgoes a smart PvE/PvP spec to solo content, can. You just need to spec and glyph JUST for soloing. The rest, is just knowing mechanics and gear. rage moar bro. Just because I'm right, doesn't mean you have to cry about it. Just agree and move on.<br />
<br />
btw, the typical &quot;&lt;Insert action here&gt; So easy? Show us how its done&quot; comment was breathtakingly hilarious. Go search the forums buddy. People do what Mione does all the time, its just not MMO-champion news. Why? Who knows. Maybe Mione whispers Boub and asks for it to be front page, or maybe Boub just loves Mione.<br />

I lol'd, but I'll humor you. Only fanboys and dumbasses who cannot think of a better comeback say &quot;you're jealous lol&quot;. Fact of the matter is, its true. Any Death Knight who forgoes a smart PvE/PvP spec to solo content, can. You just need to spec and glyph JUST for soloing. The rest, is just knowing mechanics and gear. rage moar bro. Just because I'm right, doesn't mean you have to cry about it. Just agree and move on.<br />
<br />
btw, the typical &quot;&lt;Insert action here&gt; So easy? Show us how its done&quot; comment was breathtakingly hilarious. Go search the forums buddy. People do what Mione does all the time, its just not MMO-champion news. Why? Who knows. Maybe Mione whispers Boub and asks for it to be front page, or maybe Boub just loves Mione.<br />
<br />
tl;dr, people solo this kind of content everyday.<br />
<br />
People do NOT solo Yogg-Saron everyday. As far as I'm aware, this was the first person to do so.<br />
<br />
So quit crying, man up, and show us how easy it is to solo these things. The burden of proof is on you, not us.</div></div><hr />

You're right. I am crying. Crying with laughter. You are also the third person to tell me to show you how its done. Kudos, you are as original as Mione. I have no need to show a bunch of sweaty nerds why you can spec for certain things to achieve a goal. Its a waste of time to do that to such simplistic rabble as the Warcraft community. <br />
<br />
But just because I am in a good mood from all this laughter, I'll type it out here. Death Knights can spec tank, DPS, and PvP. Seeing as how they have SO much heals, and glyphs dedicated to healing and survival... Why would it not be feasible that one could spec for soloing.<br />
<br />
While I know its challenging, use your heads people. Mione is nothing new. People do this all the time.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and for all those saying &quot;Oh well Mione did this first olol!&quot; Well maybe thats because people realized that have better things to do with their time than spend days trying to solo old content.<br />
<br />
Like you know, getting laid. Oh wait, this isn't the real world, this is the WoW community. Let me fix that. <br />

I find that it is a waste to use motherboards of such high quality and not utilize one of the key features that they support. <br />
<br />
2x GTX 460 1gb beats or 2x HD6850 beats down the GTX 480, and thus the GTX 570 and HD6970. While i appreciate the fact that it is a hassle and might not be quite as efficient in terms of power usage, the fact remains that it is very simple to setup and recent improvements to the function of both SLi and CrossfireX have improved the scaling on quality motherboards to 90+ %. I also personally find that you tend to weigh graphics to low on the scale compared to CPU power, if one would intend to use the setups for anything but lower intensity graphic games like WoW or RTS games, the new FPS's that are being released tax the graphics much harder than the CPU (and thats not even going into the debate about it being worth sinking another 100$ into getting Hyper threading..)<br />
<br />
Personally i find that more or less randomly listing hardware with no explanation is just... well, silly! I understand that you cannot writhe a novel about each build, but if they are to be anything but shopping lists - reasoning and arguments does need to be a part of them.</div></div><hr />

You are funny, I'll give you that much. But you're wrong. World firsts are NOT &quot;factual&quot; news. Its opinionated. Not everyone jumps when a world first happens, and its proven all over the internet. Continue to argue with your fallacy logic all you want, but you're wrong. Get over it. ACTUAL WoW news would be patch changes, or large events in WoW like the opening of a new dungeon, or, Cataclysm. That effects everyone, not just those who get a hardon to those who manage to kill a virtual enemy in a vidya game before everyone else. <br />
<br />
Keep falling back on your poor fridge logic all you want man, you're wrong. Just get over it and move on. Talk about computer specs like everyone else and be less of an argumental zealot who thinks his word is law.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 hours to do it? I wouldn't even want to try.<br />
<br />
edit: Now that i think about it. All these DK solos are pretty much proving DK have far too much self healing with all their other ability's. I already knew DK was broken in pvp, but this is just more evidence for all the nay sayers who want their DK's protected.<br />
<br />
You are either a troll, unfamiliar with the DK class, a complete imbecile, or all of the above. DKs NEED those self heals to survive, otherwise we get roflstomped. Ever wonder why DKs can't block, or don't have a shield, or have the lowest tank class armor mitigation in the game? Death Strike healing and Blood shield mastery are the only things keeping us from being slaughtered. Saying blood is OP for their heals is like saying warriors and pallies are OP for having a shield. <br />
<br />
Also, DK's are broken in pvp? You must've been hiding in a cave since S5. Frost single-target dps is low on live ATM, unholy's getting nerfed 6 feet under and then some, unholy's damage wasn't even good on live. DKs don't have any more control than the next class, DA I admit was bad, but DKs aren't &quot;broken&quot;. <br />
<br />
I expect you to reply to this with: &quot;yeah, yeah, you're just defending an OP class you kid&quot;.</div></div><hr />

If you don't think it is news - great! Go ahead, but Boub does and the majority of others do! Its perfectly in your rights to disagree with this as news. But hey, we weren't even arguing about that in the first place. (Yay straw man!)<br />
<br />
However, that still doesn't change the fact that DK's do NOT solo Yogg-Saron all the time. Yes, any DK can spec/gear for soloing. That doesn't mean they CAN. It takes skill and dedication, and as far as anyone knows, this was the first person to do so. You claiming that it is so easy is your own statement that YOU have to back up - not me or anyone else.

Posting back and forth and refreshing the way you are JUST to reply to me isn't arguing? Fallacy logic strikes again, and hypocrisy! That's a big word you know, careful how you fling it around. You could get hurt.<br />
<br />
Again I'll say it and pray to allah you understand this time. Just because you think its news, Boub thinks its news, and majority does, does not make it factual news. Again I say it. Factual news affects everyone. This is opinionated news, that only affects a select majority who are actually interested in it. <br />
<br />
So again, this is NOT factual news. Quit ragin bro and think. Maybe go take a shower, I'm sure with all that sweat and anger you smell like a burlap sack by now. So go relax, chill out, and come back and realize that you aren't correct on the subject of this being factual news.<br />
<br />
EDIT: We have reached a crossroads here however! Hooray! You ARE correct, it takes dedication and make some skill to accomplish what Mione and many others do, HOWEVER, Mione is a Death Knight. I'm arguing that with proper speccing, glyphing, gear, etc, its vastly trivialized. That is fact. That does not mean its not impressive in its own way, its just not done by a vast many BECAUSE of how much effort you must put into something so not worth the time and maybe even gold it'd take to afford the glyphs and spec changes.<br />
<br />
Again I say it. Just because not everyone posts about it, doesn't mean it hasn't been done before. You cannot argue that. Stop trying, for your sake, and everyone who has to bear witness to it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Not A Cat</div><div class="date">2011-03-20, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right. I am crying. Crying with laughter.

Like you know, getting laid. Oh wait, this isn't the real world, this is the WoW community. Let me fix that. <br />
<br />
Like getting achievements/world firsts/raiding NEW content.<br />
<br />
Sigh, yet another poster who tries to act smart by acting like a bigot. Now Boub controls what is, and what isn't news on this site, he deems world firsts news even if it regards old content. Also seeing as how very little people complain about it, I doubt he's going to stop posting firsts any time soon. <br />
<br />
I just don't see why you're acting so cynical over a small thing like this. Who are you to tell people how to spend their time? If Mione enjoys soloing old content, why is that deemed a waste of time? I could say it's a waste of time posting on this forum or even playing the game. Hell, why bother you could be getting laid instead!</div></div><hr />

Again I'll say it and pray to allah you understand this time. Just because you think its news, Boub thinks its news, and majority does, does not make it factual news. Again I say it. Factual news affects everyone. This is opinionated news, that only affects a select majority who are actually interested in it. <br />
<br />
So again, this is NOT factual news. Quit ragin bro and think. Maybe go take a shower, I'm sure with all that sweat and anger you smell like a burlap sack by now. So go relax, chill out, and come back and realize that you aren't correct on the subject of this being factual news.<br />
<br />
...I haven't been arguing it is factual news. All I've said is that it is news, but whether it is &quot;opinionated&quot; or &quot;factual&quot; is up to you.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if its factual news or not, its on the front page and its news for those who consider it news. If you don't like it, then you don't have to. This website isn't for &quot;FACTUAL NEWS ONLY!&quot;<br />
<br />

I find that it is a waste to use motherboards of such high quality and not utilize one of the key features that they support. <br />
<br />
2x GTX 460 1gb beats or 2x HD6850 beats down the GTX 480, and thus the GTX 570 and HD6970. While i appreciate the fact that it is a hassle and might not be quite as efficient in terms of power usage, the fact remains that it is very simple to setup and recent improvements to the function of both SLi and CrossfireX have improved the scaling on quality motherboards to 90+ %. I also personally find that you tend to weigh graphics to low on the scale compared to CPU power, if one would intend to use the setups for anything but lower intensity graphic games like WoW or RTS games, the new FPS's that are being released tax the graphics much harder than the CPU (and thats not even going into the debate about it being worth sinking another 100$ into getting Hyper threading..)<br />
<br />
<br />
SLI/Crossfire come with driver issues, more power used, non 100% support in games, and are not something you can just add a second card to in a year or so.</div></div><hr />

Also seeing as how very little people complain about it, I doubt he's going to stop posting firsts any time soon. <br />
<br />
I just don't see why you're acting so cynical over a small thing like this. Who are you to tell people how to spend their time? If Mione enjoys soloing old content, why is that deemed a waste of time? I could say it's a waste of time posting on this forum or even playing the game. Hell, why bother you could be getting laid instead!<br />

Touche, comrade. My goal isn't to get him to stop posting world firsts. As I said, its opinionated news. People are willing to enjoy what they see fit.

:x Because I never was talking about news. I was talking about whether or not it is so easy for any and every DK to solo old content - which you said it is. But we've only ever seen 1 person do something like Yogg-Saron, and this if the first I've heard of the ToC solos. You're right, the absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, but I'm positive someone would post something like that because it does take skill, time, determination and luck. I'm disagreeing with you if you think none of those are necessary and that any and all DK's can go and do it.</div></div><hr />

You're certainly allowed to have an opinion, but there are more constructive ways to do so. Your posts come off as cynical, and really just negative, which tends to incite a lot of responses. I'm not saying that you're cynical or negative, but the post makes it seem that way. <br />

Any bad Death Knight can spec and glyph to solo content, and do nothing else. So why is this news. Good for him, he decides to spend hours of his day with a shitty build and glyphs, just so he can solo content that people used to work as a team to do. Know what? I'd solo content too, its good money and the like, but good news? No.<br />
<br />
Show me a Mage soloing Valks or gtfo. I'm not impressed in the least.<br />
<br />
Daily Blink on the other hand, good shit. That and Dark Legacy makes my week.<br />
<br />
Please make a DK, get the same amount of gear, and show us how you'd solo these things.<br />
<br />
You do realise that soloing these things such as ICC and such is not EASY? It took this guy HOURS of preparation and wiping, how can it be _easy_ then? He most certainly deserves alot of credit and if you had 1 inch of brain, you'd also try to go to his youtube channel to see that he has also soloed almost the entire ICC..... He has SOLOED blood princes AND putricide, that says it all you dumbass redneck, now please get the fuck back to whatever 3rd world country you came from.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hey and JERK, soloing WOTLK stuff is NOT good money.... As I said earlier in this very kind reply to you, it requires hours of wiping and finding ways of how to manage cooldowns, and everything like that.<br />
<br />
And to tell you what, this guy he soloed everything in naxx but thaddius and gluth. I believe he will get THaddius down soon, but gluth is impossible solo, but think about it? He soloed a boss that does 40-70k swings every 5th to 10th second.<br />

Oh finally. Common ground. No, I do not believe any and all DKs can do what Mione, or Raeg do. It takes gear, some skill, time, and proper spec/glyphs to do these things. That much I can say is true, so there is challenge there. My main, I suppose if anything, grief with this is, why not a class that actually would have difficulty in accomplishing such tasks, such as a Hunter, or a Warrior. <br />
<br />
I've seen Death Knight tanks in action, they hit hard and can take a beating, like bears were in Burning Crusade. There is little more to think about as to how what Mione does is accomplished, and how it can be duplicated by others.<br />
<br />
But to see another class do these things? Now that would be a feat, at least to me.<br />
<br />
That's just my two cents, and was from the beginning. We cool? :D<br />

I'll agree with you there, then. It would be a feat - but I think it would be nearly impossible, unfortunately. :/<br />
<br />
The reason DK's can do it is because they have those mechanics - but that doesn't make it easy or less trivial. You have to know how to use those mechanics to their maximum capacity, as you would with any skill in life. It is definitely possible for many other people if they set their minds to it and practiced - but the same could be said of people throwing as well as Brett Favre (as if he still throws well), just takes practice right? :P</div></div><hr />

First, there's problems with OCZ's current Vertex 2 range where some of then have been released with chip drivers not matching the die size which means they don't work as fast as they should and other Sandforce Brands such as Corsair or G.Skill are way preferable for not pulling stunts like this without telling customers.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why you need an i7-2600K for WoW, either, very few games of much higher CPU requirement can really tell the difference between it and an i5-2500K, both overclock like champions too.<br />
<br />
@MrT The new Sandy Bridge boards have their own Dual Channel DDR3 standards.<br />
<br />
The PSUs are overkill for those sytems too, but better to be safe than sorry. I'm building something very like a Narwhal with a 500W PSU and an SSD and it'll be fine. If this is more like futureproofing for future SLI/Xfire additions, I'd understand.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to know why 120 GB is the recommended sweet spot for SSD size, personally I prefer a smaller one to just run the OS and programs which take ages to boot like M$ Office and Photoshop.<br />
<br />
Also, there are reports of being able to BIOS unlock the 2GB 6950 into a 6970, which is a nice Value boost for those willing to take the chance and the time to learn how.</div></div><hr />

But yes, I agree with you completely here. Shame very few Death Knights know the class well enough, so that is something that opens the playing field I suppose.

You are also the third person to tell me to show you how its done. Kudos, you are as original as Mione. I have no need to show a bunch of sweaty nerds why you can spec for certain things to achieve a goal. Its a waste of time to do that to such simplistic rabble as the Warcraft community. <br />
<br />
But just because I am in a good mood from all this laughter, I'll type it out here. Death Knights can spec tank, DPS, and PvP. Seeing as how they have SO much heals, and glyphs dedicated to healing and survival... Why would it not be feasible that one could spec for soloing.<br />
<br />
While I know its challenging, use your heads people. Mione is nothing new. People do this all the time.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and for all those saying &quot;Oh well Mione did this first olol!&quot; Well maybe thats because people realized that have better things to do with their time than spend days trying to solo old content.<br />
<br />
Like you know, getting laid. Oh wait, this isn't the real world, this is the WoW community. Let me fix that. <br />

But hey man, I'll humor you too. World firsts being news is an opinion. Not fact. You have no proof to back up otherwise. My thoughts are opinions, not fact. You just choose to argue with them as though they are facts. However, it IS fact people solo content all the time. Just because they don't post about it, its not true? <br />
<br />
That's like saying that millions of people don't die everyday because news doesn't say so.<br />
<br />
lol'd<br />
<br />
This is a new site. therefore anything they decide to print as news, is by definition news.<br />
<br />
I also think it is interesting stuff. Congrats. It also says NOTHING about overall balance since soloing old content is not even on the radar of the devs when they balance the game. The fact is that all 4 tanks specs are doing fine in current content. They all use different mechanisms.. pallys and warriors use block, bears use savage defense shield and dks use self healing... and guess what, they all work fine in endgame content where it matters. It just so happens that the self-healing makes DKS the best choice to solo old content.... it is like complaining about class balance based on the leroy jenkins title.</div></div><hr />

You are also the third person to tell me to show you how its done. Kudos, you are as original as Mione. I have no need to show a bunch of sweaty nerds why you can spec for certain things to achieve a goal. Its a waste of time to do that to such simplistic rabble as the Warcraft community. <br />
<br />
But just because I am in a good mood from all this laughter, I'll type it out here. Death Knights can spec tank, DPS, and PvP. Seeing as how they have SO much heals, and glyphs dedicated to healing and survival... Why would it not be feasible that one could spec for soloing.<br />
<br />
While I know its challenging, use your heads people. Mione is nothing new. People do this all the time.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and for all those saying &quot;Oh well Mione did this first olol!&quot; Well maybe thats because people realized that have better things to do with their time than spend days trying to solo old content.<br />
<br />
Like you know, getting laid. Oh wait, this isn't the real world, this is the WoW community. Let me fix that. <br />
<br />
Like getting achievements/world firsts/raiding NEW content.<br />

Lol ... You're claiming it's a waste of time to do that to such simplistic rabble as the Warcraft community, you go out of the way to recommend people to get laid yet you're on this website, trying to prove a point ...

It might be simpler than you think...I know that in p2 valks never pick up the tank. So if you're the only one there, that makes you the tank, you might not get picked up at all. And as far as the disease...if you're tanking everything in p1 then it would just harmlessly bounce off to one of the ghouls or horrors.</div></div><hr />

This should be obvious, I will only explain the dissease though.<br />
The dissease do 50k~ dmg per tick (blood pressence etc reduce this) per stack. At 1 stack, this is 150k per debuff, not to hard to live trough. Just make sure it jump between adds and not over to you, this will kill adds, and each dissease give you some nice vengance.<br />
When all adds are dead, and u want debuff gone, there is 2 things to do.<br />
1. Pop AMS.<br />
2. The remaining add can be stunned by ure pet if ure unholy (which you wouldnt be) and ure pet could get the dissease, and then u just tell it to go away and die.<br />

Yes 90% of PC cases look like some glowing kinder-garden-level space ship replica.... and those are the cheapest. <br />
<br />
Howeve you can find some nice or in our case &quot;normal&quot; looking cases if you look hard. Problem is, anything that's not looking like a glowing box with wings, costs a bit more, but people don't realize that if you buy a good build case that also looks great, it's going to last for maybe 10+ years (depending on size standards) so paying a bit more isn't really an issue -t hat's why i forked 250EUR for my Lian-Li tower (http://www.lian-li.com/v2/en/product/product06.php?pr_index=338&amp;cl_index=1&amp;sc_index=25&amp;ss_index=61) and it's going to serve me for years to come, while it looks good and I don't have to be hiding it under the desk.</div></div><hr />

DK solo is just not newsworthy, sorry.

As for the Razer talk in this thread I agree with the guy who said Razer products have no place here. <br />
<br />
Razer has pulled an Apple in the computer accessory market. They are 'good' because they look flashy and cost a lot. <br />
<br />
When they actually just sell overpriced devices with way too many lights and 'useful features'. I just don't understand how people can justify spending 3X what they need to on something that does not perform better and doesnt really offer anything useful (if you need 15+ mousebinds in addition to the countless keybinds you can have I don't know what to say...).</div></div><hr />

According to the video, it was &quot;13h10&quot; which I make thirteen hours and ten minutes.<br />
<br />
There were a lot of Val'Kyrs up in the ICC sneak peek (looked like 5 or 6). Maybe they won't ever pick up the tank. At least he won't have to worry about tards staying in Defile :-)<br />

The i7 2600K is a dual channel chip, so require multiples of 2 sticks of ram.<br />

<br />
Less sarcastically, that's why you don't buy computer parts from Amazon. You have a choice between overpriced stuff fulfilled by Amazon themselves (if you're lucky) or TigerDirect, or you can buy from a seller that no one has ever heard of--and still pay more than Newegg.</div></div><hr />

Maps are nice but come on waaaaay waaaay waaaay too late. As said earlier the only reason I can see for it is they plan on recycling Kara.<br />
Probably right after they finish recycling AQ.<br />
<br />
edit: Oh and thanks Boub for banning those idiots, an ignore button would be nice as well, I'm sure there's a few who would like to ignore my snide complaints against Blizzard all the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BLIZZARD RECOMMENDS NOT UPDATING PAST 260.99 UNLESS YOU HAVE A 4X0 OR 5X0 GRAPHICS CARD. THOSE WITH 4X0 OR 5X0 SHOULD BE USING THE 266.35 BETA DRIVER AND NOT THE MOST UP-TO-DATE 266.58 DRIVER. THE CURRENT DRIVERS CAUSE MASSIVE FPS ISSUES, AND CRASH WOW!<br />
<br />
If you're running ATI, update it to current unless you're running a dual card, or are running crossfire. If running dual/crossfire, find the 10.10e hotfix and use that, otherwise your 2nd card will run at 99% usage 24/7, which will kill it.</div></div><hr />

I can make a computer for 460 € with reasonable performance:<br />
<br />
LC-POWER 500W V2.2 ________________________________ 28,10 €<br />
GIGABYTE GA-H55M-UD2H ___________________________ 99,80 €<br />
INTEL CORE i3 550 (3.20GHZ) SKT 1156 _________________ 112,20 €<br />

I don't care about the DVD or case because I'm recycling the old ones.<br />
<br />
Or if you want something more powerfull for a few Euros more then have the i7 with the 1366 socket:<br />

I think these machines are more than sufficient to play WoW, or any other DX11 game. You may not be able to run the high end games in full specs but if you ain't rich (like me) you can't afford that...<br />

<br />
The requirements to use rune strike are either blood presence or any presence for 10 seconds after dodging or parrying.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sparky_b</div><div class="date">2011-03-22, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why do people feel the need to mock things Boub deems front page worthy? It was pages back, but some guy claimed any common person could equip, glyph and talent their way to a solo kill with a DK. That may be true for some lesser bosses, I'd suspect the Twin Valks fight wasn't all that hard, but take the Yogg Saron video from a few days back. If you look closely at that guy's P3 fight, he actually dies several times on purpose, to save himself on cooldowns. It's hard to notice, but he also had perfect (and had to have it, or he would have to wipe it and try over) timing on his Death and Decays on every single gripping tentacle. That took skill, and of course thoughtful planning and timing. <br />
<br />
Plain and simply, this is not your site, Boub runs it, he posts what he wants on his front page. You don't like it? Why bother commenting on it then? If you can't even tell the person grats or a simple gj, even if you don't mean it, why even post? If you do something Boub feels is front page good, I'll tell you gg if I even comment, but I suppose a little courtesy is just too much to ask among some of you dorks. <br />
<br />
OT: Great job on your kills, personally I wouldn't even think about trying Faction Champs, but I hated that whole place, really. It sorta sucked for me to go from an epic raid like Ulduar to ToC, but hey, can't please everybody. (I think the &quot;everybody of a certain gear type all look the same&quot; tier was the nail in the coffin for me).</div></div><hr />
