I believe you mean Consortium rep, since one of the previous mats required was Elemental Seaforium Charges.<br />

Ok, does that mean that the basic flying carpet will also become available earlier? Would make sense... Was just about to make one today, but didn't as I'm waiting till 3.2 to get the flying skill cheaper, anyway. Might just as well save the Imbued Frostweave for skillups, then. ^^</div></div><hr />

Doubt it. The problem with the flying machine was the crazy amount of rep needed for it. That's not an issue with our flying carpets, which are incredibly easy to make.</div></div><hr />

Or they're just being witty. I believe this is a correct change. Im sure they check over what they're releasing to the public before doing it with the amount of crazy bitching nerd ragers in the community who will attack them for minor mistakes.</div></div><hr />

They did grats Stars, but apparently Kungen wasn't too happy about looking bad, so apparently he went and said why Ensidia didn't down them and made some bullshit reason.<br />
<br />
To also defend Exodus, they DID release the bug to blizz. Only reason why they got banned was that Blizz didn't want everyone using this to easily kill Yogg, so they banned them for 72 hours to prevent others from doing it. It was pretty lame though, Ensidia did the same for a lot of fights and got no ban. Exodus does it once and is embarrassed in front of thousands of people.</div></div><hr />

This, <br />
No yogg+0 keepers is going to be remotely as impressive as stars since stars pretty much dished out an entire strategy lol<br />
half of the challenge is coming up with the strategy to do it, the rest is just execution / luck.</div></div><hr />

I honestly don't favor any guild over mine, tbh. Of course, we're still working on Yogg with all keepers up, but they're my buds and I wouldn't care to fall head over heels for another guild.<br />

If you are a guild that goes all out to get world firsts, it does change everything. The only reason why ensidia and any of the other &quot;top&quot; guilds are considered to be the best is because of world firsts. Not achieving world firsts, one achievement, lowers their ranking. I mean after stars provided the strategy there is no reason why ensidia couldn't have got EU first.<br />
<br />
It was just a matter of time, time for someone to get to yogg and get the strategy to work for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It depends on how you view it...but for most competitive stuff in real life, 1 thing does change everything. <br />
<br />
One of the best examples are sports. <br />
<br />
Take the NFL 2 years ago, Patriots were undefeated for the entire season, Giants were barely in the playoffs and a wild card, yet Patriots lose to them in the Superbowl, that 1 final game changes everything, doesn't matter if Patriots were undefeated leading up to that point. <br />
<br />
Oh look, same thing happened for this season in basketball, Cav's had the best record leading up to the Eastern Finals..did that matter? Nope cuz they lost, that 1 series changes everything. <br />
<br />
You can find these examples in pretty much every single competitive sport, soccer, baseball, tennis, etc. And to most people, raiding progression is getting to a very very competitive level, if you're gonna shoot for being the #1 guild in the world, you have to be able to kill the hardest encounter first as well as the ones leading up to it, if you don't it doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />

So that is the world you live in? A guild gets one worldwide first kill after the next - even when others have a day's headstart - and now they are not first and &quot;can suck it&quot;<br />

But Algalon was the final boss. <br />
Once he was dead, nobody cared about the 'hard mode' bosses!<br />

That made little sense. &quot;Even when others have a days headstart&quot;? Who have head start? Stars who got into Wotlk way after Ensidia, and still beat them?<br />

Ensidia and their cocky attitude of getting all worlds first just got owned on encounter they gave up on, so yes, they can suck it :P</div></div><hr />

No, after maintenance, all US guilds had a day's headstart on Ulduar for example. Ensidia still got most world's first there, including Algalon.<br />
<br />
Anyhow...becoming #1 will also depend on the point system that sites like wowprogress have. Obviously as mentioned in a post above, if you have playoffs, then it matters to win the final deciding match - but there are also rankings as in European football where the team wins that accumulates the most points over 34 games...</div></div><hr />

Nihilium vs Sk Gaming. Sk gaming gets KJ world first. Everyone is like zomg nihilium was beat.<br />
Everything changed. they merged and became ensidia eventually.<br />
ONE thing changes EVERYTHING.<br />
Look for these guys to merge with ensidia imo. lol</div></div><hr />

yes but algalon wasn't until after other resets, when they had to go do hardmodes, so pointing that part out is useless because they were on a level playing field the following week, when everyone was going for him.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I doubt one day plays that much of a role, considering it took months to down algalon. How much of difference does one day make then. Sure, it may affect the first few bosses, but who cares bout them ^^ <br />

&quot; ... see Blizz, we killed &lt;The Boss&gt; with mechanics you would normally call it as cheating or exploiting the game mechanics. If you (Blizz) do not care to fix the encounter we also do not care to do it 'properly'. And here is the vid of how we do it.&quot; <br />

No yogg+0 keepers is going to be remotely as impressive as stars since stars pretty much dished out an entire strategy lol<br />
half of the challenge is coming up with the strategy to do it, the rest is just execution / luck.<br />

<br />
if only killing yogg+0 was so easy just watching stars vid and repeating it in few hours... no, we had different (better) tactic to the fight done days before the video and were very close to the kill. unfortunately stars killed it before and released the video too.</div></div><hr />
