Icecrown Citadel limited attempts clarification<br />
Here is how the limited attempts work:<br />
<br />
The limited attempts applies only to the following bosses: Professor Putricide, Blood Queen Lanaâ€™thel, Sindragosa, and the Lich King.<br />
The limited attempts are shared between these bosses, so if there are 15 attempts total and your group wipes 5 times on Professor Putricide, you will only have 10 attempts for the remaining encounters.<br />
The limited attempts has increased this week to 15 and will increase to 20 when the Frostwing Hall opens and more will be added in the weeks following that.<br />
<br />
As far as the release of the Frostwing Halls... we'll see soon enough. <br />
<br />
Blood Queen Lana'thel US First Kill by Adept<br />
Oh I know you're going to hate me for this news. Adept (http://www.adeptguild.com/) on US-Dreadmaul (Oceanic) was the first guild to defeat Blood Queen Lana'thel in 25-man. It's not a hard mode but ... I posted about Putricide, no reason to not post about the next bosses!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
They also released the first video of the encounters on the live servers and I'm sure a few people will be happy to take a look at it. <br />

Blue posts<br />
There wasn't any blue post yesterday because Blizzard was closed but we already saw a bunch of them today, and I might update this post with a few more later if blue posters manage to avoid all the tornados. <br />
Icecrown Citadel Raidwide Buff<br />
This buff is something that will automatically be put on characters once it has been enabled which is still a ways away. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/22418861136-raid-wide-icc-buff.html))<br />
<br />
What happened to the &quot;every 6 weeks&quot; unlocks in Icecrown?<br />
We originally stated that the second wing would be available after 30 days (in part due to the holiday break), but that the wait wouldn't be as long for the remaining wings. In addition, The Plagueworks does not need to be cleared in order for players to enter The Crimson Hall. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22418950992-icecrown-bloodqueen-lanathel-beckons.html))<br />
<br />
WoW Magazine first issue for new subscribers<br />
Those who subscribe now should get the first issue still, but only for a little bit longer. (Unfortunately I don't have a specific time frame for you on for how much longer.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22418632956-wow-magazine.html))<br />
<br />
Koralon missing from the Vault of Archavon<br />
We're working on a hotfix to return Koralon back to the Vault of Archavon. He thought that the time in between Arena seasons was leisure time for him. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/22418860991-koralon-in-voa.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
Official Wallpaper - Pandaren<br />
It finally happened! Blizzard released a Pandaren Wallpaper (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/wallpapers/wallpaper169.html). It's not the best they ever posted but ... Pandarens! <br />

LK was said to be released in 6 weeks, which is down to 2 weeks.<br />
What do we have left?<br />
<br />
Hardmodes.<br />
Cata.<br />
<br />
Blizzard said they've learned from their mistakes and would not do another Sunwell (read: Making another raid for any other boss than the main villain).<br />
<br />
So, even in the slightest chance of Catacalysm being released in... lets say June; this leaves us with 3 months with... ICC?<br />
I think this time the world event is going to be huge... It has to be. Blizz need something to do in the gap between.</div></div><hr />

They may open the Frostwing however, this doesnt mean the Lich King will be available.<br />
<br />
Note how they say you get extra attempts on Putricide, Lanathel Sindragosa and the Lich king.<br />
<br />
Sindragosa wouldnt be one of those in that for a reason, i believe there will be a pause between her and the Lich king.</div></div><hr />

It's most likely that players will be able to fight the Lich King when the Frostwing Hall is released but only if the raid has killed Professor Putricide, Blood-queen Lana'thel and Sindragosa.</div></div><hr />

... the next minor patch should be deployed on January 19th or January 26th. (And will include the cinematic ending the Lich King storyline)<br />
<br />

The more you denigrate our heroic figures as &quot;black guys&quot; the more convinced I am its because of backlash over our cultural empire.

yes. it says: &quot;last barrier, preventing us from entering Frostwing halls, blabla&quot;.. it does not say anything specifically about lich king, who is not exactly present in the frostwing halls itself. I guess it means you had to breach plague and crimson halls to be able to breach frostwing, thus this breach is the last one. just because the frostwing halls is the last wing, doesnt mean that arthas is gonna be immediately waiting with open arms for you to get to him as soon as you defeat sindragosa, the queen and putricide. I suppose in two weeks you get your time to progress and defeat sindragosa and then one-two weeks later focus on lich king himself. the dwarves will possibly need to breach the entrance to the frozen throne as well.. just think about it - you got 10 attempts for putricide, then two weeks later 15 for putricide AND the queen, then two weeks later 20 for the queen, putricide AND sindragosa .. AND lich king? I dont think so..</div></div><hr />

Honestly, I'd wish for two things... or one.

<br />
<br />
quoting the original icecrown raid access progression blue post by Daelo:<br />
<br />
Raids will have a limited number of attempts total each week to defeat the four most difficult encounters in Icecrown Citadel: Professor Putricide, Blood-Queen Lana'thel, Sindragosa, and the Lich King. As these boss encounters are unlocked, the number of attempts available per week will increase. The initial number of attempts provided for defeating Professor Putricide is only five. When Blood-Queen Lana'thel unlocks, the amount of total attempts remaining will increase to 10. Then when Sindragosa and the Lich King unlock, 15 total attempts will be available to defeat all four bosses.<br />
<br />
ofc, the number of attempts have been increased since then, but the point remains.<br />
<br />
the same blue post contains this info:<br />
<br />
The final Frostwing Halls unlock then occurs after that, making Valithria Dreamwalker, Sindragosa, and the Lich King available.<br />
<br />
so.. no matter how much I dont like it, the information about lich king available in two weeks is correct &gt;:(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Professor was a huge roadblock for a lot of guilds, but also remember that he too was taken down pretty quickly after his wing was opened. I'm a little dismayed that Blizzard is making these bosses so easy for a lot of guilds to take down; while I don't advocate returning to the glory (*cough*) days of raiding where they'd stick in a cockblock like Vael just to keep us entertained, it just seems like we're progressing through the final tier of raid for this expansion in a really short span of time.<br />
<br />
I realize that these are simply 25-man normal modes, and the real test will be hard modes, but what about guilds that can't quite cut it for the HM's? You end up having the elitist of the elite being able to enjoy hard content until the expansion, while the folks doing normal modes complete it and...get to farm it until then.<br />

I too hate to fuel the stupidity that is a &quot;we have more heroes than you debate&quot;, but your first statement is utterly farcical. Just because MLK is not a hero to you hardly means that he is not an International hero. Activists for peace and freedom the world over regularly cite him as an inspiration. From Chinese anti-government protesters, to Iranian lawyers, to (most famously) the Dali Lama and Nelson Mandela. For someone to be a hero does not require that they did something to help or influence you personal, simply that they do something &quot;good&quot; which inspires others to follow their example. Now mentioning Chuck Norris... that was stupid.</div></div><hr />

I think you're hitting on the idea I'm trying to convey, and I'm just not conveying it properly. Calling it a 'medium' mode sounds silly, but that's about the gist of it.<br />
<br />
The problem I see with setting up modes like this is...why would we stop there? Why not make a 'slightly harder than easy but easier than medium' mode, or a 'harder than medium but not quite so intense as hard' mode. I personally don't have any solution to the problem I presented, unfortunately. I can just see it being a frustrating problem in the months to come before Cata hits.</div></div><hr />

The more you denigrate our heroic figures as &quot;black guys&quot; the more convinced I am its because of backlash over our cultural empire.
