Ghostcrawler on Tri Spec<br />
More replies today to the Tri Spec tweet (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3232-Heirloom-Shields-Ghostcrawler-on-Tri-Spec-April-30-Hotfixes-Blue-Tweets-Fan-Art) from yesterday!<br />
All the classes already feel the same thanks to you.<br />
We try to strike a balance between the demands for &quot;I need X tool that the other guy has&quot; and classes still feeling cool. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329753630137802754))<br />
<br />
Specs should be saveable, e.g. equip sets. Keep talents, glyphs, action bars. Limit could then be set to 3, 4, 5 w/e<br />
Yeah, we think an approach like that would take the hassle out of it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329754437725859840))<br />
<br />
Could you explain the logic behind tri-spec diminishing class uniqueness? more choices = more variety. <br />
You no longer think of your friend as a Feral or a Balance druid. She is just a druid who can fill any role just like any druid. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329758932774039552))<br />
<br />
If you were really serious about this statement, a character would be permanently limited to 2 of the 3 specs.<br />
The intent of letting you remake choices was never supposed to be &quot;I can swap to anything at a moment's notice.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329760054200909825))<br />
It was supposed to be &quot;I made a decision that now I really regret and wish I could make over.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329760165333200896))<br />
I do worry sometimes that dual spec solved a problem (talent points were a pain to rebuy) that no longer exists. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329759928753471488))<br />

World Boss Kill Status<br />
We are aware of the request and looking to add a way for characters to track which world boss had already been defeated in a given week.

Hey! Sorry if this has been asked before, but there was talk about letting us hide weapon enchant glows iirc. Idea scrapped?<br />
Not scrapped. Just not sure yet on the right design. It gets into the issue of weapon transmog pretty quickly. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326870634279890944))<br />
<br />
I don't understand why rings are unique-equipped, is it too game breaking to have two of the same kind? Any plans to change?<br />
You only get so many gear slots, so chasing the same BiS piece for two just removes some of the gearing options / opportunities. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326446309424918529))<br />
That's understandable, but going for BiS is completely optional and nothing something all players do, I'm no expert but...<br />
Unfortunately, we find the opposite. Many players expect BiS and even consider the second place item to be &quot;garbage.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326453033359794177))<br />
<br />
I like the new talent system but it makes leveling kinda unrewarding. Long stretches where you get nothing.<br />
Agree. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/326447222856220672))<br />
<br />
As a corollary, that mean healers lacking mitigation should actually be leading &quot;meters&quot;, Yet, the opposite is true.<br />
Most players would do well to compare their own performance night to night and stop worrying about what everyone else does. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327959748706197505))<br />
Either remove the ability of HPS meters/WoL to work,or balance the game around it.Cant change everyone's minds<br />
Neither of those seems like a reasonable response to misinterpretation of data. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328223580523462656))<br />
<br />
Do you feel that the shared achievements have worked out for 10 and 25 man raiding? Any plans for the future?<br />
We think shared is fine, but it would be nice to be able to determine which version someone earned the achievement in. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327876976977264640))<br />

Buff Naturalist another 10% please, resto druids are bottom of logs in pve and burst pvp far outstrips resto driuds heals<br />
Logs aren't a great way to measure healing done. Just as one example, PW:Barrier doesn't show up while Tranq does. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327882826856931328))<br />
<br />
Why are shaman and druids doing so poorly this expansion in pve healing?<br />
We think shaman are fine. We think druid hots get trumped a lot by absorbs, esp. paladin and Disc's. 5.3 changes should help. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327870726398963713))<br />

Just witnessed some major BrM hate in LFR lost 2 perfectly fine tanks because of their lower health pool, so many hate on BrM<br />

Eternal Flame blanketing with paladin mastery is so strong. Why not revert the mastery nerf and make EF HoT not stack mastery.<br />
We buffed EF just before release and have regretted it ever since. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327874313933955072))<br />
Mastery was too strong regardless, but longer-term we don't want EF to be the only choice for Holy. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327874259718377472))<br />
Could you follow up with a why? EF(in a 25h raid) implies much greater skill then keeping up SS+using LoD<br />
Eternal Flame has like 90%+ use for Holy. That means they effectively lose a talent choice. If some used SS then it would be fine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327882509880803328))<br />
Keep in mind: to drop EF for SS, LoD needs to be viable. It's not good enough atm.<br />
LoD just has to beat WoG, which it does. Eternal Flame is the problem. It lets Holy become a Resto druid and a Disc priest. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327959047611498496))<br />
<br />
Recent Q+A mentioned more with shields - possible future choice for Ret (a la War TG/SMF)? 1h-shield Ret sounds interesting!<br />
I think there is some interesting design space for offensive shield use. The 300s Spartans don't feel like Prot warriors to me. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327868317043920896))<br />
<br />
I think retri pala still needs some special/unique ability to be picked up for &quot;serious&quot; games in pvp. What do you think?<br />
Not crazy about the idea of 34 unique abilities to ensure that every spec gets picked up for PvP. Just feels like an arms race. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327871859209166848))<br />

Was Rain if Fire intended to be part of Destruction single target rotation? Any plans to change it? Sorry if it's a repeat q<br />
Not crazy about it. We don't want to change it for 5.3 in the middle of a tier, but maybe 5.4. We could buff embers in other ways. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/327957210099511296))<br />
An idea I had was to make RoF only generate embers if it hits at least 3 targets. What do you think about that?<br />
Something like that would be fine. Just need to make sure single target ember generation doesn't feel too slow. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/328227081689374720))<br />

That's irrelevant. People use Heroic Leap as a gap closer and not for it's DPS, especially with the nerf to the glyph.<br />
If they're using it as a gap closer, then they don't need to worry about minimum range. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/329313967581323265))<br />

1.) tri spec: he cant hold his ground on their own forums against the average forum user with his &quot;arguments&quot;<br />
2.) world boss tracking was &quot;suggested&quot; (like you honestly had to suggest something like this) already during 5.1 PTR, and we had a blue post stating that they are looking at it... nothing changed<br />

You can get gear for all specs, you can go to the npc and redo the spec to become that, so adding the third spec just takes away the 10 min it will take to swap spec, buttons, and so on, if that even takes 10 min.<br />
<br />
To make a player look at as, &quot;Hey that resto druid&quot; they'll need to go back down to having one spec, and the cost to re-pec a lot, like back in the day when you would cringe at how much it was, but needed to, and you didn't do it over and over in one day, as we do now.<br />
<br />
They made a mistake by adding the ability to have two specs, and I know they wish they could undo it.</div></div><hr />

Ghostcrawler makes a VERY good point on Tri Spec. It makes your class more bland and the decisions and options you choose more mundane and pointless. Variety is better, Tri Spec is bad.</div></div><hr />

I will always be branded a Boomkin -- but I can play Guardian very well and Resto efficiently. Why should I have to stop what I am doing to go to the trainer and respec? It is a waste of time. <br />
<br />
The argument of people just having every spec and not being recognized as a specific spec is stupid. A player will always have a preferred spec that they enjoy playing the most and their friends and fellow raiders/pvper/ect will recognize and brand them as that spec because they know their friends. I mean yeah, I also play 2 other druid specs but my friends don't recognize me as them. Unless your friends are incredibly stupid/clueless then I am pretty sure they already recognize you as a specific spec. <br />

Dunno what point you see here... we're already able to swap talent specs in a matter of 10 mins, gather different gear sets and learn how to play them. THIS would only make sense if classes were ONLY allowed to chose 2 specs and keep them forever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's the Sha of Pride. While Lust would cause Garrosh to act the way he is, Pride is more dominate in him, especially as an Orc. He already has power, but he doesn't have the achievements that Thrall, or his Father has. So in seeking his own, the achievement of defeating the alliance, would cause his pride to swell up attracting the final Sha to him.</div></div><hr />

War can't last forever, I unno about you but I find the whole &quot;horde vs alliance&quot; over done ... It was awesome in Classic, ok in BC, and dead (to me at least) at the end of BC.

No he didn't. Because you can still play all the specs and I know plenty of people who do. It is really annoying when someone suddenly has to end up tank, heal or dps in raid and we have to wait for them to port back to the trainer and respec and change their bars. All tri-spec does is add convenience. It was a QoL change, nothing more. Adding it or not adding changes nothing about how &quot;bland&quot; the classes are.</div></div><hr />

I join a group with a paladin and a priest. they ask my spec, I say WW and they then ask if i have a heal spec (I do) and ask if i have the gear on me... our hit points were 425K (me), 375K, and 368K. Now, I can tank a Warbringer on my monk no problem (we op yo) but probably couldn't heal meh geared dps (as in I couldn't, I'm merely average skilled and average geared MW). With the option for multi-specs, it seems that people always assume you should have them and be geared in them - though I never said anything about them having Prot/Holy/Disc spec alternatives. <br />
<br />
I'd suggest adding Tri-Spec but having it be quite costly. 250K gold range. If you NEED tri-spec, you can afford it. If you merely wish for it out of convenience, thereby WANTING it, you might be able to afford it. I personally cannot, since I'm a casual scrub, but it would at least give the people what they want.</div></div><hr />

As for the 2 points...<br />
The tri-spec argument from GC I find absolutely valid. We've been living with only 1 spec for years, and we've been fine with it. Blizzard gave us dual spec, as a convenience. Now that we have the convenience, and got used to it, a bunch of spoiled players who can never get pleased no matter what, bitching why we don't have Tri-spec. We do not NEED Tri-Spec. It's not a game breaker not to have it.<br />
If we get it one day, it's cool, if we don't our game play won't suffer at all.<br />
<br />
World Boss tracking.... <br />
Another point which is entirely on the players part.. And it is amazing, how you can call a designer from Blizzard an idiot for not giving you a &quot;tool&quot; to track something, you should be able to track by yourself. Is he the one who can't remember what he did, or is it you who cannot remember? <br />
There are ways around that.... The tool exists in the game ever since. It's called Macro... You can't make a macro? Well, how can you call someone an idiot, when you yourself lack the handling? And even if that's the case and you cannot make a macro, you could use an add-on which exists (World Boss Status). <br />
<br />

Oh, I certainly do. If it wasn't stated, it was implied. 50/50. &quot;Want to get on your priest&quot; was code for, we need top of the line deeps. &quot;We need your resto druid&quot; meant they were PVPing and needed heals. Now it's &quot;eh, get on your raper monk&quot; if they want to win whatever it is they are doing. I also know many people with 2 or more of the same class, each with different specs (oddly enough, equally geared). Might just be an RP thing in some of our minds.</div></div><hr />

They have been making classes more bland for years now but this is where he draws the line? How is that a good point?<br />
Talent trees get revamped to extremes which makes the 'choices' more mundane and pointless. But tri spec is bad?<br />
<br />
I don't need or want tri spec. It is just very funny that he draws the line here and that people agree with him and say he makes a good point. Why is this a good point and why weren't all his/their choices over the years that made classes, or even this whole game, more bland bad?</div></div><hr />

You no longer think of your friend as a Feral or a Balance druid. She is just a druid who can fill any role just like any druid.<br />
<br />
Really? That's such complete bullshit. They still have to fill a spot in the raid. The fact that they can fulfil any role doesn't change that the raid only has room for a DPS. Having three specs also doesn't change the fact that you still need to gather gear for those specs. Having three specs doesn't mean you are good at all three, or that you can use all three during a raid, or that you have the gear for all three.<br />

Tri-Spec or make it easier and cheaper to change specs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both points you made are non-issues. <br />
I wonder what names you call others, when it's about real problems and issues.<br />
<br />
but with tri-spec, how does it hurt you personally? Don't like it, don't buy it. You don't even have to buy dual-spec!!! Just tell your raid to wait 10+ minutes while you go back, reset, and fix your bars. You can still do that to this very day. It isn't about being spoiled, it is about making the game fun overall. Take Rift, you can have I believe 6 full specs. It is about not stopping GAMEPLAY for tedium. <br />
<br />
It also comes into play when you have a really good PLAYER in your raid, who can perform exceptionally well in multiple roles, especially ones that the gear translates across specs well. Bring the player, not the spec. Say you have a top world skilled druid, who has a full agi and int set, with some spec specific off pieces, and a reforge mount in your group. They main as a tank; you are 1 tanking and letting your other tank take care of it ... now your uber druid could switch to their 2nd spec, but guess what, you have too many melee already, and this fight works better with range. Crap, your tank has feral as 2nd spec. At this point, you choose between either a) running melee heavy, throwing raid off balance, or b) waiting 10-15 mins while you send them to respec ... and this can happen for any class with multiple roles.<br />
<br />
Limited specs is an outdated limitation; far more outdated than the old talent system that let you select how you want to increase your power (which they could have reworked properly to create choice, and still gave a per level or two feeling of character progress).<br />
<br />
Basically, there should be no 'specs'. You have your various trees, you choose to make the one you need to play now, the active one. You want to switch between your 3/4 roles/trees ... you do it. You have your bars set up for all of them.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, why not go backwards, and make it so that whatever spec you choose at 10, you can never change from? I mean, really it all comes down to convenience and player choice, and if you want to limit it, than go all out. If you are a fire mage, and you want to try out arcane ... level a new toon, don't be lazy and spoiled, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
World Boss tracking ...<br />
<br />
If you actually read blue posts ... this topic was brought up recently, from someone who tries to kill Oon on all their alts. There is a BUG with the MACRO, that if you kill Nalak, you can't check if you killed Oon on that toon. The person lost track of which toon did what. They were asking when the check the macro does would be fixed, though an in-game tool would be nice ... could be added to the 'lockout' toolbox.<br />
<br />
Ofc, anyone could just keep a notepad handy, and write down stuff, or use notepad on their pc. But an in game tool, seems like a more efficient way.<br />
<br />
<br />
You though, obviously just think your opinions are superior; therefore, any contrary opinions don't hold much weight nor should even be considered ... since there are starving kids on the street everyone but you should be more worried about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me fix something for you ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Both points you made are non-issues for Wildtree.<br />
<br />
but, for a portion of the druid community and beyond, being able to play all your specs without spending a minimum of 10 minutes, some spend much more, would be a FUN addition, something to add to the gaming experiences as a whole.<br />
<br />
For the world boss kills, for people who play the game much more than some; those with 6-11+ toons at max level ... having an in-game tool to keep track of world boss kills, which they enjoy doing on all their alts, seems like something that shouldn't be too hard to do ... OR at the very least, fix whatever is broken on their side that breaks the macro that checks it.<br />
<br />
the hypocrisy is strong with this one ... <br />
<br />
I wonder what names you call others, when it's about real problems and issues.<br />

I do not know if he is mocking his customers, ignorant of the changes he has been responsible for, or simply spouting bulls#!t he thinks someone wants to hear. As Warcraft Lead System's Designer, Mr. Street bears a large degree of responsibility for changes to how World of Warcraft if played. When he says, <br />

There really isn't a good argument at all against tri-spec. My guess is that it's more a matter of the development work needed to tweak the ui to do it is low on the priority list, but blaming it on wanting to keep everyone unique sounds better even though it's a bit ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Giving out 3rd spec tab wouldn't change anything about the class. It would only make it more convenient to respec, it's not like the 3rd spec is blocked, the problem are the action bars and some addons for swapping sets fix the issue.</div></div><hr />

i find that funny cos the whole of the talent system was revamped making the above statement by ghostcrawler true, seriously GC please just resign from blizzard majority of the time you havnt got a clue about WOW and when you do its a troll post please go back to your old marin job thanks bye</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dawnseven</div><div class="date">2013-05-02, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I happen to like GC, but I don't like his answer on the tri spec thing and I think Blizz is being unnecessarily stubborn on the issue. If they wanted to keep things unique they shouldn't have allowed for dual spec in the first place (or arguably respec at all). But since you COULD respec, the dual spec thing was really just a convenience. If you were short on heals your shadow priest no longer had to leave the raid, go back to Org/Stormwind, respec, and get summoned back. Instead, it became click here, click there, swap some gear, pick up where you left off. It just made life easier. Tri spec really isn't any different. I have a holy/ret pally. If I want to go prot for some reason there's nothing to stop me from doing so, it's just a hassle to change is all. Arguments about character uniqueness just aren't valid. <br />
<br />
(P.S. &quot;You no longer think of your friend as a Feral or a Balance druid. She is just a druid who can fill any role just like any druid.&quot; -- yeah, but &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; right? :cool: These two arguments don't mesh.)</div></div><hr />

If it wasn't stated, it was implied. 50/50. &quot;Want to get on your priest&quot; was code for, we need top of the line deeps. &quot;We need your resto druid&quot; meant they were PVPing and needed heals. Now it's &quot;eh, get on your raper monk&quot; if they want to win whatever it is they are doing. I also know many people with 2 or more of the same class, each with different specs (oddly enough, equally geared). Might just be an RP thing in some of our minds.<br />
<br />
In the case of pure DPS classes I think of them just as the class, so hunter, rogue, mage vs mm hunter, sub rogue, frost mage. It doesnt really matter what spec they are because they all do the same thing. Otherwise its dps warrior, prot warrior, holy/prot/ret pally, ect as a reference to their role. The 2 priest healing specs are the same as a pure dps class. As for what you know your friends as, it would be their main spec. Friend X is a holy paladin with dps offspec. So even if that friend took prot as a 3rd spec, he would still be a holy paladin with both offspecs.<br />
<br />
What GC said doesnt apply to a lot of players so it really isnt a good argument. Then add in the fact that you can have multiples of the same spec and his argument is completely worthless. I want to spec my hunter MM raid/MM solo/Surv, shes going to be different than most other hunters.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2013-05-02, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dunno what point you see here... we're already able to swap talent specs in a matter of 10 mins, gather different gear sets and learn how to play them. THIS would only make sense if classes were ONLY allowed to chose 2 specs and keep them forever.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I usually side with GC on most things, but he is losing this argument. We already have two specs, so nobody is a ´moonkin´ anymore. And even 3 specs is fairly easy right now as long as you don´t want to jump around mid raid. I go healing spec on Tuesdays to knock out LFR (with feral as secondary), then when I am done LFR, I change the healing to tanking for the rest of the week for satchels. Not really that big of a hassle. But I think GC´s argument is weak only because for most players, we really don´t think of them as a spec anyway. in my case, the spec I always keep (feral) is the one nobody sees me in because it is for soloing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play druid, and I have the option to fill every role, which is sweet.. atm I play healer, but I believe the following could be true for tanks aswell:<br />
<br />
I need 1 spec to be viable in PvE (Healing).. if I ever want to grind / quest / dailies... I got my offspec (feral). That was all fine till blizzard updated the PvP system in 5.2 (Great changes)... so now I have to fit in a PvP spec somewhere.. would love to have that as a third spec, instead of using (to be fair, not that much) time to change glyphs, talents and spells...</div></div><hr />

<br />
When Seer Hao Pham Roo reaches the last rope anchor, he begins his dialogue as he is walking. However, he disappears prematurely, which I believe is why the audio cuts out early (around the part &quot;as yourself&quot;).<br />
<br />
I repeatedly tested this and the result was always the same - the NPC only walked halfway and then fade away while he was still talking. I couldn't get him to finish that part of his dialogue.<br />
<br />
Seer Hao Pham Roo still appears besides the lore object &quot;The Emperor's Burden - Part 2&quot; to end the quest, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm also of two minds on the whole tri-spec matter. On one side, I wouldn't mind at all if players were allowed to pick a third because I know that I wouldn't bother with it outside of getting an achievement for it. On the other side, though, choosing a spec ought to be meaningful - if you can basically &quot;select all&quot; then nothing really matters.<br />
<br />
I would strongly dislike it, if it were to ever happen, Blizzard removing dual-spec. I regularly switch between roles and I can very much remember what playing was like prior to patch 3.1. Here's a hint: A lot of people thought - and still do - that it was a godsend.</div></div><hr />

Probably not corrupted but because of his pride, he feeds the Sha unknowingly which in return feeds his hunger for power. So possessed or corrupted no, but working with, possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Resolutions are much more sweet if the conflict has been a long time going. WoW won't last forever, and the war between the alliance and the horde has to end in a 'draw', it would piss too many people off if one side dominated the other. So:<br />
<br />
A) They have to cease the conflict eventually<br />
B) They probably want to cease the conflict before they end WoW's expansion cycle entirely, so probably in the next 1-2 expansions (hopefully it will go on, but the longer they draw it out, the more random stuff that has nothing to do with established lore they have to make up, ie Sha)<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with an end to something. Do you really want the game to stagnate and be remembered as something that didn't know when to quit?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd disagree with that. I, personally, feel that the Sha of Pride is too important (MoP lore wise) to have it be a heroic only boss, something that only a small percentage of players will experience.</div></div><hr />
