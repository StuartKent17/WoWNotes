Hello, and welcome to Artcraft! I’m your host Chris Robinson, art director of World of Warcraft, and today we’re going to tackle something I know a lot of you have been looking forward to: facial customization options.<br />
<br />

<br />
When we began working on the updated character models, we knew it would be a huge project, and we weren’t sure we could do it all at once. The idea originally was that a few races would be available at launch, and all the others would be patched in throughout the course of the expansion. While it wouldn’t have been ideal to see a mix of lower-quality and higher-quality models running around side by side, it did seem like the most realistically achievable solution at that time. Since then, though, we’ve committed ourselves to getting all of the original character models in by launch. It’s been a monumental challenge for us, but we think the effort is worth it, and the finish line is nearly in sight.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/july/thumb/faces01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/july/faces01Accurate.jpg) <br />
<br />
Our next big focus is doing justice to the facial options. With the original models and their simplistic geometry and low-resolution textures, a lot of facial expressions were simply painted on. Now that we’ve moved to higher-polygon models with lips, teeth, and fully articulated faces—not to mention higher-resolution textures—recreating those same facial options isn’t as simple as painting them onto a flat surface. Previously, to get a sneer out of a model, you’d just paint a sneer on its face, and that was that. To do it correctly now—and make it look great—we have to fully pose a sneer, create a custom texture, and mesh that base pose with all of the existing emotes and animations.<br />
<br />
These more detailed face customization options were also originally part of our earlier “update-as-we-patch” rollout plan. Our initial idea was to release the new models with their base face, and then add additional options in updates over the course of the expansion. Again, that plan was based on the sheer amount of work involved in creating what are effectively all-new races (art-wise) on top of all of the art a big expansion like this one generally requires. But stepping back, we came to the conclusion that it just wasn’t going to be a good experience to have everyone playing with the same face geometry and a slight texture change, not knowing what their character would really look like until some later patch. In the end, we decided it would be best to tackle all of a race’s facial options at once. Up to this point, you’ve seen one facial geometry set, but very soon you’ll start seeing more finished products for each option in upcoming beta builds.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The original Dwarf model (left) has his teeth painted directly on his upper lip to give him a snarl. With the new models, which have fully modeled and textured teeth, a simple paint job just isn’t an option—it would look terrible. In the middle, you can see what that same sneer looks like right now in the beta test; on the right is what you’ll see in an upcoming beta build.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
On the left, we have a pair of original Orc faces. The second column represents what you’re seeing right now in the beta build, showing texture variation but the same facial geometry. The third column shows a posing rig to demonstrate how we’re customizing each of the face appearances further. On the far right, you can see the final product.<br />
<br />
We’re working hard to ensure all of the updated character models have the high level of quality you expect from us, and that we expect from ourselves. This revamp is a truly enormous project that we care deeply about, and we know you feel the same. We’re looking forward to seeing all of these new, high-quality, awesome-looking models running around Azeroth, and we hope you enjoy seeing the characters you know and love in a whole new light.<br />

Why does it wondering you? Blizzards intention was it to release the models with the same faces, people intervened them with their complaints. Should we now shut up and say nothing, or what do you want? People like you are cancer for every MMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem was the amount of people who complained assuming that the lack of unique faces was going to be a permanent feature, rather than an update that would be rolled out eventually. It's one thing to suggest that Blizzard release it all before the expansion launches, it's another to complain without taking into account the fact that we're in beta.</div></div><hr />

Well... Yeah.<br />
<br />
That's kind of the point of FEEDBACK and BETAs. People gave their feedback, Blizzard responded to said feedback. That's how these things work.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if its something they realised while developing these new models, or if they overwhelming response from the community forced their response, <br />
but these are looking pretty cool! Definitely should allow a little more variety.</div></div><hr />

I feel a bit bad now for harping on about same-face, when they had plans to alleviate same-face in later patches .. but then they should have just said that :) if I had known there was a fix on the way, even in a later patch, I would have been very fine with that. But of course, having distinct faces on launch is even better.<br />
<br />
I wonder if there's gonna be an option to keep the &quot;samey&quot; faces from beta as well? In case some people might have gotten attached to those already. Basically, for every face, offer the adapted version, and the neutral looking beta version?</div></div><hr />

People can be ridiculous... and they were. However, Blizzard basically set themselves up for all the nasty feedback - all they had to do is say &quot;We are working on different faces - chill.&quot; But they didn't - instead they remained silent for months. Why? probably because they wanted to see if they could get away with less work and go &quot;Panda face&quot; on all the races ...</div></div><hr />

I feel a bit bad now for harping on about same-face, when they had plans to alleviate same-face in later patches .. but then they should have just said that :) <br />

They said from the beginning the plan was to retain the essence of the previous models. Robinson said months ago there would be a blog about facial customization.<br />

That's kind of the point of FEEDBACK and BETAs. People gave their feedback, Blizzard responded to said feedback. That's how these things work.<br />
<br />
This wasn't a response to feedback. They said the plan from the beginning was to do this, just with the delays with WoD they could do it for launch instead of in patches.</div></div><hr />

My remaining concern is for the Blood Elves.

As someone who loves playing Blood Elves, I'd honestly rather they delay Blood Elves until 6.1, instead of rushing out a model and rushing the faces. Blood Elves look good enough as is to not stick out like a super sore thumb like most of the Vanilla models would have.<br />
<br />
I want them updated, of course, but more importantly I want them updated really well and carefully. If Blizzard doesn't have the time to do that yet (I do want those poor designers to catch a couple hours of sleep sometimes, as well ...), then I'm fine with waiting a bit more.</div></div><hr />

A lot of us remembered the female Worgen and Pandaren, and being very disappointed about the same face issues on those races. I especially remember hearing that &quot;more female Pandaren faces would come&quot;, and then those turned out to be nothing but fur markings. So yeah, I was very worried about the revamps. I'm all the more relieved now, though. (And hoping that in a later patch, when they got some time, fem Worgen and Pandaren will see some additional faces as well. I'd really like to play them, but can't, with the heavy same face.)</div></div><hr />

If you think that, why haven't they changed capital cities back to their original spots and put flying back in the game?<br />
<br />
There was a lot more feedback about those 2 changes.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure what Chris wrote is right, they wanted to do this after release, not before, but since something delayed the game obviously, they had time to do it now. Maybe it's what delayed the release, or departures of people, we'll never know.</div></div><hr />

I REALLY hope they're not done with the texturing on them. The new idle facial rigging is a nice touch and will hopefully get rid of the perma smile on certain races, but you're exactly right. The face on the left looks little to nothing like the human female on the right. Her eyes are buggy and tense, she's got no shading at all around her eyes which was the big selling point of the earlier face and (it may just be the angle that she is presented her) but the entire facial shape seems to be different. She's got an entirely different jaw line going on there.</div></div><hr />

You can't exactly replicate the old one. The old female face barely looks human,so if you would go as far as to directly copy that look and put it into the brand new models it would look very,very weird.<br />
What they've done so far is the best it can get.</div></div><hr />

It will never be 100% the same because new human model is already different than the old model. Their face shape is already different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And their other initial announcement, that Blood Elves and Draenei would not be updated by launch was just as ass-backward of an idea. You HAVE to update the Draenei because they're one of two starring races in this expansion. If only the Orcs had been updated, it would have just looked ridiculous.<br />
<br />

What boggles my mind is their complete lack of foresight on this project. It's like someone actually went and said &quot;Hey, if we get half the game ready for launch, that's good enough right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Personally, the Blood Elves should present the least challenge to design. They're slender humans with no defining racial traits other than being really pretty and having pointy ears. I know several 3D artists on DeviantArt who could roll out such a model, with textures, in about a month. I rather expect Blizzard artists to be somewhat more capable than that.<br />

You underestimate how complicate a task like this is. This is not the task to simply build a good looking model that some will like or some will don't. It's recreating the model people have been playing for years. People are sensitive to even minor details.</div></div><hr />

Did you even read Robinson's post? The &quot;same face doomsayers&quot; were right. Blizzard was planning to dump sameface on us all, and then fix it &quot;later&quot;. (Titans alone know when that 'later' would have turned into. Two years down the road, if we were lucky. Never if we weren't.)

<br />
From the post at the top of this thread:<br />
These more detailed face customization options were also originally part of our earlier “update-as-we-patch” rollout plan. Our initial idea was to release the new models with their base face, and then add additional options in updates over the course of the expansion. Again, that plan was based on the sheer amount of work involved in creating what are effectively all-new races (art-wise) on top of all of the art a big expansion like this one generally requires. But stepping back, we came to the conclusion that it just wasn’t going to be a good experience to have everyone playing with the same face geometry and a slight texture change, not knowing what their character would really look like until some later patch. In the end, we decided it would be best to tackle all of a race’s facial options at once. Up to this point, you’ve seen one facial geometry set, but very soon you’ll start seeing more finished products for each option in upcoming beta builds.<br />

No, I do not. I know some artists who could do that and we're talking about 1 guy working on 1 model, done in 30 days.<br />

Imo, all they need is a little shadow on the eyes. And a little less definition on the bottom lip. Here, I did a quick photoshop to prove my point (the far right face):<br />

<br />
You're underestimating the work that goes into such a model. You're saying 1 person can build 1 model in 1 month, including all animations to look and feel exactly like the original? Youre friends combined would certainly be busy for 1 month combined just creating a dance for 1 gender of 1 race. and it would still look like crap. Your statement is a blatant lie</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Handsome</div><div class="date">2014-07-30, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This wasn't a response to feedback. They said the plan from the beginning was to do this, just with the delays with WoD they could do it for launch instead of in patches.<br />
<br />
They never shared with the playerbase that they were going to improve facial variety after the new models were released, so why would we expect them to? If there was an initial plan at the beginning to do so, then they should have told us. That way, we would have had less threads/tweets about the same-face issue and nobody would have been worried if Blizzard was going to do anything about it.<br />
<br />
Only recently did they share that they were going to work on this, and only recently did we know they were going to do something about it. Chris said in a tweet that this was to address the issue of same-face people kept bringing up. If no one brought it up, and if everyone seemed satisfied with the current work, then what would encourage them to work on it further? How do we know if no one complained if we would have gotten this facial variety later? It was due to people's complaints that we got answers that this feature was coming.</div></div><hr />

The amount of people claiming 'same face' has been more irritating than the no-flying ordeal. <br />
<br />
Finally we get to see that so far the new models are a 'base-face' to then mess with and re-create the new faces based on the looks of the old models.<br />
<br />
I hope this means that my gentle faced Tauren will still look gentle and my rugged old one will look rugged and old again! Doing a great job Blizz, really, keep it up and keep impressing us! (most of us ;D)</div></div><hr />

It's a pretty big deal for people that like to roleplay I think. Not saying it's &quot;only&quot; for them, but you see, it's very important for some people. We get attached to our toons, well at least I do.</div></div><hr />

Me too. Not that I really RP, but having my main look completely different would <br />

It is an insane amount of work.<br />
What i mean is:<br />
<br />
Old Model: 1.0<br />
New Model 2.0<br />
<br />
They planned to release models with basic sameface as version 1.5 and update that to 2.0 in some later patch (who knows when or even if).<br />
I called the 1.5 version the &quot;half assed&quot; version.<br />

Imho: Either release 2.0 or leave 1.0 until 2.0 is done properly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My thoughts exactly. Don't get me wrong, the orc and dwarf models look great, given they also were the first two models finished, and most likely spent more time on them. But nothing in these examples show different faces. All they show are grin animations being done. The very minor wrinkle details that differ on the two orc faces would never be noticed at normal viewing distances.<br />
<br />
I think the reason everyone is going crazy about the &quot;same face&quot; look is because certain models don't have varying skin colors, or drastic changes in characteristics, like scars, night elf tattoos, or undead elements. Without them, they will always look the same since they aren't giving us options to customize faces.<br />
<br />
That being said, I think all the models look better then the originals so far.</div></div><hr />

Good point. Good point. However, this does not really matter. Depending on the way they do the rigging, the base values each face starts with do matter a lot. Tho, even though this is just the basic idle-setup that will be different for each face, this will also lead to the faces looking different depending on the way they did it.</div></div><hr />

To be perfectly honest: the two old model Orc faces look the same to me. One snarls a bit more but that's it.<br />
If they want to stay true to the original, then it's to be expected that the redone models will be very similar too.<br />
<br />
Maybe it wasn't a good pick for an artcraft. I would have picked something with more clearly visible differences.</div></div><hr />

They didn't listen to panda's faces. It wasn't totally out of the question that they might of done the same again especially if the workload was pandas x11.

I don't think anyone should be thanking you, the entire same-face crowd has been annoying and pushy from the start. Blizzard had intended to do it in patches, but same-face crowd wanted it &quot;Now now now&quot; instead of waiting. Game play, features, dungeons, raids, etc are a little more important than &quot;same face&quot; to be fixed right off the bat.

Tbf, another Cataclysm would be a failure on Blizzard's end, not on the playerbase. They would delay if there was no way, they're all adults and not diaper babies in need of your protection.<br />
<br />
And, you can't really speak for what is more important to people. You can speak for yourself, and to many the new models are a MASSIVE deal that they look forward to exploring on the day of release.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure if the discontent was the only reason they changed their plans, but I think it had a part in it.<br />

My remaining concern is for the Blood Elves. Obviously with Draenei playing a big role in this expansion, they must be updated, and obviously are, but the Blood Elves aren't part of the &quot;original character models&quot;, and we've heard nothing about their status so far, but I would think that, as skinny humans with pointy ears, they wouldn't be that difficult to create.<br />
<br />
FIY Blizzard guys: your original plan was dumb, I'm honestly surprised you took that idea seriously.<br />
The &quot;skinny human&quot; thing neglects the concept art. They look different to humans. They've never been portrayed as hugely skinny (well, maybe the females), just leaner than humans, as were NE for the most part, with some exceptions. They are my favourite race though, so I hope Blizzard takes care in updating their model and takes on board the feedback about the issues plaguing them re some of the emotes, the idle stance and some of the animations. I have no doubt that they'll update the muscle definition to do away with the &quot;smoosh&quot; that came with their &quot;beefing up&quot; (in reality, the beefed up models are closer to how they were portrayed in the concept art, anyway) and bring back some definition.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zathrendar</div><div class="date">2014-07-30, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, the Blood Elves should present the least challenge to design. They're slender humans with no defining racial traits other than being really pretty and having pointy ears. I know several 3D artists on DeviantArt who could roll out such a model, with textures, in about a month. I rather expect Blizzard artists to be somewhat more capable than that.<br />
<br />
I think they are actually a challenge, in that they do have defining racial features, particularly facial, and need to be kept distinct from the humans at that level. You could really just say NE are purple, attractive humans with long ears, orcs green, very bulky humans, draenei are pretty, demonic looking humans, dwarves stumpy humans, gnomes child-like humans etc etc. It isn't that simple and glosses over the differences between the races and the challenge in keeping them distinctive. In fact, from what I have seen of many DA artists is that they fail to capture the distinctiveness of BE, that the concept art often does succeed in delivering, so much so that you could accuse them of looking like little more than humans with mildly pointy ears. So I can't agree with much of what you said.<br />
<br />
There's plenty of easier models to implement, like that of gnomes, where they have done a very good job so far. In reality, the less human-looking the race (and very few truly fit this bill), the easier it probably is to design, insofar as it is easier to make it distinctive.</div></div><hr />

You are certainly right, but you get my point :p i don't think we need to fund another club just for the female gnome angry face gone.

Mostly because according to a shocking amount of MMO-C posters, Blizzard is a group of &quot;lying&quot; &quot;promise&quot; breakers.</div></div><hr />

This is why you should WHINE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE DURING BETA. Only time when something can be fixed.<br />
<br />
I agree you should give plenty of feedback but whining comes across more as childish and entitled. Provide logical reasons for changes needed, and if the company doesn't adhere to them find a new argument or if they provide a good counter at least give a nod to reason and see what happens. I'm likely to patient so I end up just waiting to see the results before I get angry, so don't rage much. I'm likely a minority in that too but still I like the new models and faces are coming along well. Hopefully people will be patient till they finish before breaking out pitchforks and torches to chase down the monsters who ruined the game.</div></div><hr />

Please don't encourage the forums to continue to not understand the difference between constructive feedback and whining. I guarantee you, delivering your feedback in the form of QQ, raging or whining in no way adds weight to your argument and if anything just makes your comments hit Blizzard's mental spam filter. Plus, it makes the forums shitty annoying places to hang around in for all of us.</div></div><hr />

For once Lunchbox I agree with you, people whined &amp; complain about Same Face &amp; the fact was the faces were not done. An than they had to push aside the Blood Elf to fix the same face issuse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The current blood elf model doesn't have anything to make it look too outdated. The skin texture is smooth and the details are plain. they are more updated than the vanilla races too. Considering they aren't as present in WoD as Draenei, Blood Elves can wait just fine. It's only a delay til a later patch anyways.</div></div><hr />

Fair enough they said that, but imo that's not really acceptable lol. To have one of the main features of the expansion be New character models, and for that feature to not be completed for release is quite ridiculous for a company such as Blizzard. Fair enough, most will be complete, and it is a big undertaking, but even so for a company that earns MILLIONS a month, surely they can afford to get a few more experienced people working on the character models in order to ensure they're ready for release. No point defending them, they are a company, and company's face angry customers daily. If a company fails to deliver, it can't expect all of it's customers to just smile and give them their money.</div></div><hr />

Does it even matter? We're going to be playing Warlords of Draenor for 1.5-2 years. Who can even remember what was in mists of pandaria at launch and what came later? Does it matter if its there on release day or if it took an extra 30 days when we're deep into 2016? Sometimes things take time. <br />
<br />
Personally, i'd be a lot happier if they spread out these model updates throughout the next 6 months or so so they can avoid shotgunning us with content patches like in Mists. I want my face to look unique but I can wait for that. Would much rather have the modelers working on new raid mobs or updated BC creature mobs and such. <br />
<br />
Hopefully this means they will introduce some face changing to the barber shop.</div></div><hr />

I was looking forward to playing a BE alt in WoD, with a fresh coat of paint. It's a little disappointing they won't be fabulous for launch, but them's the breaks. It'll happen. My Tauren main is going to look badass, so I'm happy.</div></div><hr />

But I think all people playing blood elves will be satisfied in the end. Since these players seem to love the boring, nagging anime look, and since that is the look Blizzard has leaned towards a bit with the updated models, the blood elf players will love their new look with eyes covering two thirds of the head, no nose and silly, stupid and childish poses :)<br />
