Update 
Another guild, Transcended (US-Blackhand) went in Hyjal and got some trash mobs death touched ... They successfully killed Rage Winterchill and Anetheron. If you look carefully at the staff dropped by Anetheron, you will notice it's the (or one of them) druid tier 5 weapon (see this post).

Curse (http://www.curse-guild.org/priv/forum/index.php) guild from Vek'nilash is currently having some fun in Hyjal Summit on the PTR, and they're of course dropping new loots. A GM is helping them but no bosses got death touched, they just fought them without the trash &quot;waves&quot; before the bosses. <br />
At the time of this news, they're still in Hyjal and we should have new loots to post very soon.<br />
<br />
Loots summary<br />

<br />
I don't know, maybe because of the WC3 background, but somehow it feels like being teleported back to a place where you have already been.<br />
<br />
Well, can't wait to fight him :&gt;</div></div><hr />

What this really doesn't represent however is that the trash is HARD. We wiped on the trash and u will not have time to rest etc.. before engaging the bosses after the waves of trash. I think this is why the bosses are not super difficult. That being said the kazzak style guy will be very very very hard after doing the trash with no resting, since he was already pretty tricky with insane gear and no trash :)<br />
<br />
insanely fun instance, most fun i have had in wow in months<br />

But in WC3, you needed an army to kill him, not 25 guys.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mek</div><div class="date">2007-05-12, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ah ok i understand you now, well keeping in with the lore/history has never been one of WoW's strong Points<br />
<br />
but remember u are constantly fighting along side massive amounts of npcs + the heroes (jaina/thrall/tyrande) so it's more than just 25 guys. thrall for example is insanely strong, he does lightning bolts/summons wolves (one wolf actually offtanked a doomguard for us on the 4th boss for around 1 min) ... his hp is monstrous atm, he solo'd around 5% of the kazzak boss after we had wiped and still had 70% hp before i asked the GM to deathtouch thrall (he would have solo'd the boss from 15% -&gt; 0%). It really is an epic thing tho with the npc's and such :) As for archimonde I doubt u actually get him down ... he will just get low hp then go up the world tree for the event, then u get a chest with loots.<br />

<br />
Fight is still not over though. Who knows what will come next. I wonder why the dragonflight is nowhere to be seen. After all they are the reason we are entering this place.<br />
<br />
And are the bosses realy that easy, mek? I mean the whole instance seems to be on par with black temple, which is supposed to be the end game of BC. Speaking of the bosses alone, leaving the trash out, how difficult would you rate 'em? TK ? SSC? Or a step up from both?</div></div><hr />

They would have to clear SSC and TK several times, and this will take some time and then time to learn the bosses. What are your guesses on an ETA for Mount Hyjal first boss, if you have any? (I know it depends a lot on the individual guild ofc).<br />
