Guild challenges are now available on test realms, so far it only looks like weekly quests pushing your guild experience cap further. However it looks like the game also supports gold rewards for challenges, maybe after you reach the cap (See the Build 13793 Strings below). we will probably know more about it when Blizzard posts the official preview.

I´m also really not sure about the rewards.. again.. By the time this gets implemented, guild experience will be a non-issue as most guilds will be withing striking distance, or even already lvl 25.</div></div><hr />

Well, at least to beat a raid boss or win 3 rated BGs are actually real challenges to some guilds...<br />
<br />
you'd be surprised how challenging this is these days. People's alts and 3rd and 4th alts even have even saturated heroics value. On a usual non raid night we earn about 200-500k out of 6k cap.</div></div><hr />

well blizzard isn't exactly well known for their Innovation after Cataclysm, everything seems pretty half finished, and nothing is more useful then the minimum requirements for it to work...so it shouldn't shock you</div></div><hr />

Gold is no incentive, we have 15 active accounts in guild and have around 400k gold in the bank. Why would we need more gold? Bleah.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Atleast this will be great for guilds that have only levels 60 / 70 / 80 and that wont level up any more than that, will be easier for them to level up the guild presuming there is no level 85</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably won't be anything. The guild who got it first got it b/c of a bug that didn't reset their xp like 99.9% of other guilds' xp was on launch day. Many people will see this as a non-legit world first then, even though it's blizzard's fault it wasn't reset. <br />
<br />
Everyone who is still racing won't get it for another week, and with how many guilds that will get it at about the exact same time, it will be almost impossible to prove who got it first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Congratulations on being one of those few guilds where gold is worthless, or being extremely stingy with gold. If you have spare gold, you can turn on guild repairs, or increase the max allowed. You can go to the AH and buy up epics to get your guildies (or their alts) geared up. Buy everyone a sand drake. You just aren't trying hard enough to use that gold. If you have all that then, yea its not going to help, but for the rest of us its nice... Still it would be nice to see more rewards than simply gold (such as raw materials).</div></div><hr />

A fairly well-built guild will do these on a weekly basis anyway. It doesn't add something &quot;new&quot; or &quot;refreshing&quot; or even a &quot;challenge&quot;. So we do what we were doing since Cata hit, and get extra guild xp in return, and you call this a new exciting system? I'm not impressed..</div></div><hr />

Maybe you just don't appreciate cynicism. Cynicism isn't always meant to be funny, either, though it's often a nice side-effect of it.<br />

<br />
WOW is stagnant cause Blizzard isn't really taking the content forward and supporting the new systems they have ingame. Be that LFD tool that should be supported with diffrent setups - random mobs and more variety... Raids and PVP that is pretty much exactly the tech that was used in TBC - or GUild system that is killing alot of guilds -rather than helping them progress through the raiding content.</div></div><hr />

You mean something like fish 100,000 fish from pools... or disenchant 10,000 items. Yeah.. they should definitely add these types of challenges to the game.<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it, that is probably what they are planning on doing. Take every achievement and break it down into week-sized bites, and then reset it every week. So it will be like fishing 1,000 fish from pools or do 300 daily quests.<br />

It is very lame.. I thought it would be something more cool and different... but it looks like it will be just more useless rewards for doing things we are already doing, or else they will just have boring grinds that reset every week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard's whole modus operandi is to look at what other games do, copy it, integrate it, and polish it to an exceedingly high standard within their own games. The last time they genuinely invented a new mechanic was sometime back during the lost viking era. I'm not complaining -- its a legitimate strategy, and it results in some very good games. WoW raised the bar for the whole industry. But when people complain 'Rift is just a wow clone', i have to presume they're trolling since it only takes an IQ of 50 to see the irony.</div></div><hr />

You can thank the Moonguard realm for that one. The ERP (erotic role-playing) going on in Goldshire, at one time, got so bad that GMs had to sit and actively monitor the place for a long while.</div></div><hr />

can't wait to start seeing raid invasions in wow &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
To be fair, the Elemental invasions in old vanilla as well as the opening events for Naxx (I think) with the undead invasions were essentially raid invasions. Just a lot less intrusive as the ones in Rift as I understand it.<br />
People initially liked them, but after a few times they just got in the way of getting your alt leveled.</div></div><hr />

Yes i find it somewhat amusing because i like watching people to stupid things.</div></div><hr />

So let's say:<br />
You argue with guild leader about something, you got kicked.<br />
You, and few people that left guild after that incident, make new guild. <br />
You are already grinding current raids.<br />
And these challanges are perfect for such guilds, that want to become high level, without more time spend on leveling alts.<br />
Also, are you all blind or what?<br />
Each guild challange completed will reward guild experiance beyond the daily cap.<br />
And of course no one had an idea that these challanges can be diffrent, for each guild level.</div></div><hr />

If someone has any info on it that would be great.</div></div><hr />
