Believe me, hunters are noticing this. And it's absurd all 3 specs of a pure DPS class are at the bottom.<br />

Nope, it`s -sometimes- a lot more than 220k...based on current parses, mythic Cenarius in EN: 1. SP with 925k dps (770 parses), mm hunter is the best hunter spec with 558k (742 parses) second best is bm with 546k (357 parses) and third is survival with 490k (19 parses)<br />
or Xavius where is SP 1,3 million vs 656k mm, 617k bm and 566k survival....</div></div><hr />

Yes, the mind control bonus damage buff combined with Shadow Priest Surrender to Madness is god damn OP. Does that mean SP is broken? No.<br />
<br />
It's a single encounter where a certain mechanic puts the SP way ahead others. If anything, it's faulty encounter design.</div></div><hr />

This is very good representative of what kind of posting you can be sure to find on MMO-Champions Forums. So much negativity and 100% bitching, all the time. <br />
<br />
Kinda like the Official Forums - but MMO-C once was a true gem and worth reading, there always was some gold hidden in all those vitriol. Sadly, this seems to have changed to the worse. <br />
<br />
Well, guess I rather enjoy the Game and stop reading Forums filled with hatred and rage.</div></div><hr />

I too really dislike the Wild and Standard split (especially considering the recent tweets that hint that even Standard could be affected by the Yearly purge!). <br />
<br />
Do I create decks? Nope. I might be able to if I really sat down and looked at my collection but I'm much more likely to look at popular decks on Hearthpwn and choose one that I have most the cards for and then play that deck and (enjoy?) pray to RNG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you check the rest of the fights please? The difference between the first and last place is horrendous, at least 150k if not more...<br />
Nythendra: 810k vs 585, Elerethe: 810k vs 485k, Ursoc 830k vs 601k, Dragons: 885k vs 588k....and so on..most of the times the 3 hunter spec is amongst the lowest 5....On Guarm (which is the closest to a tank&amp;spank fight in ToV) 713k vs 529k and the 3 hunter spec is the last 3.....<br />
<br />
The whole shit is broken like fuck...yes somebody must be the last one, but hell..not with few 100k difference....Not hunters, not any other classes...10-20k, damn 50k difference between the 1. and last...ok fine (no, but sounds okeyish :D) but not 100-200-500k.....<br />
<br />
Wondering what the bloody fuck did they do on ptr and what kind of sims are they using....</div></div><hr />
