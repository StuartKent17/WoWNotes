Are you sure ? If that's the case, then it's just like having one &quot;intelligent category&quot; acting the same way as it used to be when you could chose between &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;zandalari&quot;.. which would mean this change doesn't make any fucking sense :[</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably made it that way so instead of queuing for 2 dungeons you can queue for all of the old heroics at the same time when you are trying to get your weekly vp's. It did get boring queuing every time knowing you were either getting ZA or ZG. I think its a good idea, and they should lower the ilvl requirement now that the dungeons have been nerfed. Which of course will make it easier to gear alts.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinykong</div><div class="date">2011-12-20, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ZA/ZG nerfs are because they are now lumped into the &quot;random Cata heroic&quot; cluster. Groups who are just barely geared for heroics can get these, and are getting stomped. A guild mate of mine went through numerous tank/healer combos over the course of an hour on the first boss in ZA, and finally gave up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much my understanding of it too, yeah.<br />
<br />
Probably won't see many more people with the ZA bear, though, unless the group is quick to pick up that it's full of players that know what they're doing. Most people running the regular Heroics probably just want to kill the minimum amount of bosses to get through, get their points and move on.</div></div><hr />

The problem is the starter PvP blues. They have had their item level buffed every patch (4.1 excepted) and they now currently stand at 377 last I looked. This worked fine so long as the Zul dungeons had their own queue tier, but with them being added to the regular heroic rotation you now have fresh 85s ending up in those dungeons regardless of whether that player is ready for it or not. And no, you can't simply bank the PvP gear because the system still takes them into account when determining a player's item level.<br />
<br />
That is what the problem has come down to, so it actually surprises me that Blizzard took so long to nerf those dungeons.</div></div><hr />

A new lvl 85 player has NO valid reason to own PvP gear anyway, so destroy it until your PvE gear is high enough to prevent any PvP gear being able to tarnish your displayed iLvl.</div></div><hr />

Putting them back all alone would make no sense because nobody would ever and I mean EVER run them. Those dungeons take to long to do and since the standardized the amount of vp gained why would you put yourself through that. If you did decide to do them (if they were seperate) then so few people would be queued it would take forever to get into the place and forever to finish it.</div></div><hr />

There are many people who would run them for fun and for bear runs and even VP, but with all the unskilled 85 noobs in there now since 4.3 it became impossible to be any fun.</div></div><hr />

Are you sure ? If that's the case, then it's just like having one &quot;intelligent category&quot; acting the same way as it used to be when you could chose between &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;zandalari&quot;.. which would mean this change doesn't make any fucking sense :[<br />

<br />
Well, I've been gearing my fresh 85 Prot Warr in the last week and I can confirm that all standard heroics, zandalaris and the new HoT hcs kept their ilvl requirements. Making the nerf quite sad as it requires the same gear as before and it wasn't that hard, the only way to make it hard was with some lack of CC but it was mostly due to fail interrupts. People must adapt to the game level and not the other way.<br />
In a week farming gear I've done ZA twice, period. Why? Because 2 epics from there and the 378 you now get with Justice is enough to throw your ilvl high enough be able to queue into Hour of Twilight heroics. It's so easy to get gear as it is now, the only way to justify this ZA/ZG nerf would be with the decrease of ilvl requirement making it part of the standard heroics just to speed up a bit the gear grind. Plus, the new dungeons are complete epics giveaway, they lack difficulty even tho they are &quot;fun&quot;.<br />
I understand that Blizz cares about casuals and stuff because they are losing memberships at a fast pace but making the game this easy will only make players get boredom faster, even casuals will get bored.</div></div><hr />

Good job on those nerfs as well.. sorely needed, especially now that people can be rather well equipped in 378's in a weekend of the new return-to-Wrath instances.

By Gosh, you're right! After waiting up to 30 minutes in a queue I should then take a 15 minute hit + another queue and hope that I don't get another zandalari again (40% chance). All for a problem with the queueing system and not the person queueing.<br />

the only thing older than pervs drooling over women on the internet is the stereotype about pervs drooling over women on the internet.<br />
seriously, it's the perfect red. and she is rather cute. probably because she isn't perfect and pretty crazy (at least for the camera to not crush your view that all women just exploit men with sex appeal). I know you probably think it's sick when guys find a girl hot who isn't blonde and has huge tits - that just proves they never saw a real girl, huh?

I think its a good idea, and they should lower the ilvl requirement now that the dungeons have been nerfed. Which of course will make it easier to gear alts.<br />

I think they removed or reduced the gear requirement in the patch, perhaps by mistake. I've had to kick a couple of undergeared tanks since the patch, anyway. So I guess they chose to simply reduce the difficulty of the instance, and thus give new level 85s a larger pool of instances to play, rather than increasing the iLevel requirement again. It makes sense, really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It do really make sense since after patch 4.3, ZA/ZG is merged into Cataclysm heroic and thus only requiring an item level of 329. A new player with quest greens would be crushed by ZA/ZG which was originally tuned for ilv346.</div></div><hr />

A freshly geared 85 does not have the required ilvl for ZA/ZG, unless they cheat the ilvl with PvP stuff. <br />
And if they have the correct ilvl, they should not have any problems whatsoever, unless you have a bunch of raid geared DPS that don't know the word 'threat'. (which they should)</div></div><hr />

<br />
well ZA and ZG are now queued along with all the other older heroics. i know you still wont get in if you lack ilvl but for &quot;newer&quot; players that just got enough ilvl (without even knowing probably) and have only been doing the other older heroics these 2 instances come as a surprise (and probably not a good one), so they nerf em a lil to be more similar to the classic heroics.<br />
of course it is lame as nerfs usually are but it does make a tiny bit of sense</div></div><hr />

I think they removed or reduced the gear requirement in the patch, perhaps by mistake. I've had to kick a couple of undergeared tanks since the patch, anyway. So I guess they chose to simply reduce the difficulty of the instance, and thus give new level 85s a larger pool of instances to play, rather than increasing the iLevel requirement again.

It's in the random rotation with heroics that are tiered for lower ilvl. So, yes. Unless you enjoy having the chance of your tank or healer with an ilvl of 333 or less in your pre-nerf ZA or ZG.</div></div><hr />

As for ZA/ZG nerfs, well... yawn, just put NPCS in the front of all old content Cata dungeons to reward badges without the players having to run the instance, I would just reduce the rewarded badges by 33%.

If an outside player were to read these forums they would think 90% are heroic raiders. Didn't you all take the que that 3 million lost subs due leaving wow had a lot to do with hard content IS NOT FUN to the majority of the player base. Why do you want hard content for old crap you are just trying to get valor for anyway? When you want hard content, do heroic raids. Hard lengthy content is just grindy once you have done it 45 million times. I was so sick of ZA/ZG, I will be happy if I get that one in my rotation to face roll it, as I do not want to spend another minute in there.</div></div><hr />

We are getting a third difficult level in next expansion -it's called Challenge Mode and [upon entering] the instance will replace your gear with that which matches the challenge; finally a nod towards the 'bring the player, not the gear' paradigm many call for.</div></div><hr />
