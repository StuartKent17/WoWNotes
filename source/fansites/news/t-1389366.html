As long as the chance of getting epics from that are (VERY) low, then I'd be OK with this. No epics from this would be a plus, but I'm sure that's far outside the realm of possibility, tho.<br />

Just so they have someone to add the tiny bits of of details to the world to make it more alive. Weather it be to the way the npc's act, the way you can interact with the world and adding new dimensions to game systems (like say when recruit for a guild you can carry a billboard in your chest like the cataclysm prepatch twillight's hammer, and you can just click on the guy walking to sign the charter).<br />
<br />
I really think this is the most solid advice I can give to the WoW team. The game needs to be very fun, alive and immersive, and the story characters with more certainty than drama. Integrity is what a game needs to get people to play it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Deal. Back in the day, all top-end raiding was 40 man, then 25 man. 10 man is too limiting on class balance. They've had to homogenize the classes so much so that 10 man guilds didnt whine about not having every buff in the book. &quot;WE WANNA TAKE FOUR DK's, BUT WE DONT HAVE STAM OR BLOODLUST!!

<br />
Well tbh I'd rather grind mobs than do dailies for rep. If you miss dailies you miss out on rep. If it's grinding mobs everyone can do it at their own pace. The hardcore players can go and spend a weekend and get exhalted while the casual players can kill a couple every day and keep the same pace that dailies had. Seriously, screw rep bound to daily quests.</div></div><hr />

I liked the reforging system in general, the only big (and I mean freaking huge) problem was how it interacted with hit/exp.<br />
<br />
Also hope they partly reverse the daily quest decision, as they got the balance right in 5.1 and were only a little heavy in 5.2, as far as numbers of 'relevant' dailies went. It really was only the plain 5.0 content (and somewhat Molten Front before it) that were too heavy on dailies.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, adding an entirely new category of stats with their own bonuses definitely dumbs the whole thing down.<br />
<br />
There was no &quot;min maxing&quot; with hit and exp. Either you had the correct amounts, or you didn't, and that was all there was to it. Boring.</div></div><hr />

You can still have a 10 man raid guild. Or a 14 man raid guild, or a 25 man raid guild or whatever size you want. You're no longer forced into having a specific (or stable) number of players for your raid guild unless you want to be a Mythic raider.</div></div><hr />

I think you really need to look at this in the context of developing the game and pushing out content. I think their goal is to cut down on the amount of time they have to spend balancing 1,000,000 variables to both create and tune new encounters. You're entitled to your opinion, but you can objectively argue that less fussing with tuning and gear tweaking = more time to create content and balance it. I don't think your gear theorycrafting experience is as important overall as those larger goals.</div></div><hr />

Because they backed themselves into a corner with so many raid difficulties and rather than remove LFR they decided they'd shit on actual raiders by fucking with the raid structure that actually matters.

Ugh.. Why bother with lfr then?<br />

LFR has always been a last resort entry to raiding. It was only needed so much due to Blizz's continual inability to implement an effective LFG tool. Hopefully they're finally going to get that right, if not LFR (and LFD) will remain what it is today.</div></div><hr />

and clearly Normal and Heroic will be weaker than they are currently. So todays &quot;Normal&quot; raiders will be &quot;Heroic&quot; raiders in WoD? So next question is: Will we still be required to clear &quot;WoD Normal&quot; before entering &quot;WoD Heroic&quot; even though it's supposed to be on par with current &quot;Normal&quot;?

They do, they are just not Fins. It's their preference not to take international members but stick to their own countrymen, yet I bet my left testicle that if they opened up to a broader audience they would have 50 applications in 10 minutes. They can filter through those and easily get 10 additional good players.<br />
<br />
As said many other 10 man guilds who are not top of the top, but still do heroic content don't have that luxury and they fight for each member there is, and you don't get 50 applications in 10 minutes, but maybe 50 applications in 2 years of which 45 might not suit your guild. <br />

There is absolutely no reason to do Shaohao rep (past revered) unless you want the mount. It really doesn't take that long to get revered and if you don't need the freebie Burden of Eternity or the mount, there's no need to do any reputation farming for Shaohao. There aren't any patterns or anything of that sort from grinding the rep other than the mount and the freebie Burden of Eternity.</div></div><hr />

I like the grinding of mobs on Timeless isle for rep. But also, add items that can drop to turn in for repeatable rep bonus. Small amount of dailies is ok, and 1 or 2 weeklies like Timeless that give additional rep. Daily dungeon for rep like they added, and the commendations at revered helped. Combine all this into each new faction and it will give players more choice. I love reputations, and I don't mind it taking awhile, give us more choices on how we want to farm the rep and I'll be happy.</div></div><hr />

The only reason classes were becoming similar is because 10 man heroic raiding needed every buff and wanted to min/max just like any other 25 man guild. I think 20 man is a sweet spot, 25 have to drop 5 (let's be honest there is always someone you carry in a 25 man)....10 man have to just recruit another 10 or merge with a respectable 10 man guild. I personally like this because if you merge you can still do heroic together then move towards Mythic as a well organized and prepared team. <br />
<br />
One difficulty for Mythic makes things MUCH better in terms of encounter design, it is going back to the way it used to be and personally I welcome this change.<br />

For the record, I am a 10 man heroic raider.</div></div><hr />

They have more than enough classes as they just added one last expansion and how do you expect them to do all the work involved in a new race when they're completely revamping ALL of the vanilla and BC races?</div></div><hr />

I really really really do not understand how followers completing things while you are offline is even considered an &quot;addition&quot; or &quot;gameplay in an MMO. Makes absolutely zero sense, why even bother playing and further more this is Blizzard we are talking about, it will have an odious RNG element.<br />
<br />
Actually, this doesn't look like an original concept. This looks very similar to what Cryptic does in a lot of their MMOs such as Neverwinter or STO. Basically look at Neverwinter's &quot;crafting&quot; system or the system in STO where you can send crewmembers on missions. It looks like the same concept, just Blizz is adapting it into WoW. Like most of the new changes I've seen since I've started playing this game, I will reserve judgement until I see it in action.</div></div><hr />

I have to concur. It was always interesting figuring out what gear was best. Slapping on a piece of gear takes away the tediousness, yes, but to some, it was actually fun. Might as well go play Gayllods now.</div></div><hr />

more epic's going to be handed out like candy.<br />
<br />
Yeah, sure. Get your new item, log off, go to askmrrobot.com, load your character, press &quot;Optimise&quot;, go back online and copy/paste whatever it suggest for you.<br />
Oh, if you're a hardcore minmaxer, you first simcraft your character to get better stat values, than go to amr, put your relative values and press Optimise.<br />
Oh, what an elite theorycrafting process it was.<br />
Of course, trying to minmax your class performance by getting items with lifesteal or cleave is dumbing down. For sure.<br />

It just sounds like you will have no real choices to make when gearing. <br />
<br />
The gear you get changes to your spec which is pretty much going to mean anything with a higher Ilvl is a straight upgrade. <br />
<br />
So far all I'm seeing with WoD is the cosmetic appearance of TBC to appeal to the nostalgia a lot of us have for that era, but with the same terrible decisions that have plagued the game for the last few years hiding underneath. The game will be too casual even for casual players at this rate. Even casual players want a challenge and some choice.</div></div><hr />

The main issue people had with it, was that a new item meant your hit/exp got screwed, so you spent a load of gold reforging everything to get everything capped properly. Removing hit/exp makes reforging a whole lot simpler and cheaper so it should be left in. The loss of reforging, reduction in enchants and less gem sockets just removes a lot of the customisation that helps one character stand out from others amongst his or her class.<br />

Getting new items should be exciting. Right now it feels like you have to do a lot of work when you get a new item.<br />
Hit and Expertise don't feel like a bonus, so they are now gone!<br />
Dodge and Parry, gone!<br />
Reforging, gone!<br />
Enchanting is still around, but fewer items can be enchanted. There will be more enchant choices for those items.<br />
The number of items with gem sockets will be gone. Only one gem slot per item. Gems are more powerful. Sockets are a bonus that don't count towards item level budget. No more socket bonuses or meta gems.<br />
The stats on armor will now change based on your spec. Plate drops and it will have whatever stats your class needs, no more Intellect plate! No more PvP Priest Healing set and PvP Priest DPS set, just a Priest set.<br />
Jewelery, cloak, trinkets, and weapons will be more role focused and might keep stats.<br />
Armor will become a good tanking stat again, Spirit will be good for healers.<br />
Tertiary stats are bonus stats that can appear on gear that don't count towards the item level budget. Lifesteal, avoidance, sturdiness, movement speed (stacks with other bonuses), cleave, and more.<br />
Item squish is in! All of the big jumps from old expansions and raid tiers will be flattened.<br />
Your relative power won't change, just the numbers. The speed at which you kill things won't change. You can still solo old content.<br />
<br />
best part of the expansion<br />

Seriously, though, all those changes sound awesome to me. Getting an upgrade has increasingly become more of a chore over the course of the expansions, whereas in classic, you got the drop you were looking forward to for ages and the most you had to worry about was an enchant. Then came, gems, it started to get crazy with reforging and upgrades. The thing you have to remember is that the stuff they are taking away, was originally implemented as a shiny new feature to one xpac or another, a new way to increase character power. But you can really only keep doing that so many times before it starts to become trivial and meaningless. What is being sold to you now, as shiny new feature, is the removal of all that and a reversion to a simpler time (with some modern tweaks and improvements). Bringing stats back to basics alongside an item squish feels right.<br />
<br />
I think it's going to be fun getting that item with a nice amount of cleave on it and seeing how it affects your character in a meaningful way, rather than it just adding a bit of a numbers boost. With this system there are probably still going to be 'ideal' item combinations, but it feels like it might be less restrictive and more of a flavour thing over all.</div></div><hr />

Once i cut ties to something, i unfortunately don't go back; The only miracle that might get me is if a bunch of my old raiding guild from BC &amp; WOTLK wanted to come back and make a good 20 man raiding guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also hope they partly reverse the daily quest decision, as they got the balance right in 5.1 and were only a little heavy in 5.2, as far as numbers of 'relevant' dailies went. It really was only the plain 5.0 content (and somewhat Molten Front before it) that were too heavy on dailies.<br />
<br />
And not even the 5.0 dailies. It was mostly just Golden Lotus that was terrible. I enjoyed AC and Klaxxi as well as the serpents, cooking and fishing.<br />

Clearly Garrison Missions have been inspired by STO's Away Team system. It's a nice addition that will add more things to do in game .... kind of like an alternative/supplement to crafting.<br />
<br />
There are dozens of online games that have similar things. The problem I may have with it is that it adds very little gameplay. Ok, you go into the screen, select 5 followers, send them on a mission to do a dungeon. Log back on in a week and get your reward. It is a neat little addition, but doesn´t have a lot of gameplay involved with it because you don´t actually see your followers do the dungeon or control them in any way.<br />

I never want another rep farm like the Shahao rep ever. again. I'm currently just over 2k rep into revered and I actually can't face the fact I have to spend 6+ more hours farming Yaungol to gain rep to get exalted. I just wish there was other things to actually do to gain rep, it's so pointless. &amp; I like dailies as well tbh. I don't think there's anything wrong with dailies if they're done correctly like the Dominance Offensive storyline.<br />
<br />
I quit once I hit revered. I will go back at lvl 100 and faceroll the mobs for the mount. You can save yourself a lot of boredom if you have patience to get the ´exalted´ vanity rewards an expansion late.<br />

<br />
one size &quot;heroic&quot; difficulty really allows for better balancing and the class homogenization will probably go away for the most part. The only reason classes were becoming similar is because 10 man heroic raiding needed every buff and wanted to min/max just like any other 25 man guild. I think 20 man is a sweet spot, 25 have to drop 5 (let's be honest there is always someone you carry in a 25 man)....10 man have to just recruit another 10 or merge with a respectable 10 man guild. I personally like this because if you merge you can still do heroic together then move towards Mythic as a well organized and prepared team. <br />
<br />
One difficulty for Mythic makes things MUCH better in terms of encounter design, it is going back to the way it used to be and personally I welcome this change.<br />
<br />
For the record, I am a 10 man heroic raider.<br />
<br />
And for the record.. before this begins.. All of the sever connections should be done, which should make recruiting a 20 man raid group much easier.</div></div><hr />

Does this only apply to picking up items? Or will it change dynamically? I really dont like that they used a priest in this example... Why not a hybrid class example?

I really didn't even mind Golden Lotus. Any of them in a vacuum were decent, but the problem was the &quot;Gotta do everything to be optimal.&quot; (overemphasized by VP gating, epic rewards at exalted for two factions, etc.). That's largely why I singled out 5.1/5.2 as better, because there was only one daily hub per patch and they weren't too long (except 5.2 when the entire island was open -- it was a few dailies too long for doing every day).<br />
<br />
Though they did rather suck if you were still working on any of the 5.0 ones, of course.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heppu</div><div class="date">2013-11-10, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically there is no longer any difference in loot stats except for item level and appearance (which the latter can be transmogrified)? I really wish they would just remove the whole stat system all together. It's outdated and dumb since you cant have players make decisions about anything anymore because the average player doesn't even understand he has been asked a question. He is just curious about the silly fire on the ground and the EPIC loot he will be rewarded in the end for his &quot;accomplishment&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kenshinag</div><div class="date">2013-11-10, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So because Mythic is a set 20 players. Ten man guilds after they complete heroic (Which is just normal mode) have nothing left to do? If so, thats Pretty lame.<br />
<br />
You know what you can do with all that extra time you have?<br />
<br />
Start looking for 10 more players.</div></div><hr />

Finally no more bullshit about 25vs10 man and finally it actually takes some sort of organization to take down hardmodes instead of slapping 10 ppl together(oh schnap now ppl gonna be angry with meeee). Good move blizzard, me like. I dont like the simplified stats system tho, making wow easier to &quot;read&quot; isnt one of my favorite points tbh.</div></div><hr />

Play Final Fantasy My Life As A King on the Nintendo Wii,that is what the Garrisons is based on.</div></div><hr />

After all the 10man isn't real/proper raiding arguments, does that mean that 20man isn't real/proper raiding either, because 25man raiders always stated that 25man was &quot;where it's at&quot;? It's not that the other modes are relevant... :p</div></div><hr />

Also the thing with the daily quests in MoP feels to me is like an pretty optional thing, it's not like you NEED to do it.</div></div><hr />

Now that NPC will have no function. Good thing I stopped myself from buying it.<br />
If the whole experience of the new xpac will be like Timeless Island, then I will not buy it. I had sort-of fun during the first month after release and I was forced to go there recently to finish my legendary cloak. I'll probably still visit it for a few more weeks until I get the gear pieces I want from Celestials/Ordos. And I won't set foot on it ever again. Shaohao rep? Do not want. And I thought farming Ogres around Haala was boring to madness.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zknm7</div><div class="date">2013-11-12, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everything sounds amazing. Single raid size for server/world first competition, and being able to raid multiple raid formats each week, but still not required to, because loot will be shared.<br />
<br />
I'm amazed!<br />
<br />
The respective difficulties don't share loot lockouts; I.E. if you kill Blackhand on Normal, you can still get loot off of him on Heroic and/or Mythic.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure that they're saying there will be elements of Timeless Isle that they'll use. Like the rare spawns and things of that nature. I don't believe it will be entirely like Timeless Isle.</div></div><hr />

Right now they are mostly soloable rare spawns, but the WoD events will be more complex and not soloable.Unsoloable quests? Just what we need. Such a rubbish.</div></div><hr />
