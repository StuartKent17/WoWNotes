WoW Token – Additional Details<br />
As many players are aware, there are certain limits in place regarding how many WoW Tokens can be purchased per Battle.net account, both from the in-game Shop and through the Auction House. Today, we’d like to provide a quick update on the current limits to help you better plan your Token purchases. <br />
<br />
<br />
A maximum of 10 Tokens per week may be purchased for real money from the in-game Shop, to be sold on the Auction House for gold.<br />
A maximum of 36 Tokens every 24 months may be purchased for gold via the Auction House, to be used for game time.<br />
Players may only have one type of Token in their inventory at one time. If any character on a Battle.net account is currently holding a Token purchased from the in-game Shop, that player will not be able to purchase a Token from the Auction House. Likewise, if any character is holding a Token purchased from the Auction House, that player will not be able to purchase a Token from the in-game Shop.<br />
Players may hold a maximum of 10 Tokens in their inventory at one time. This limit is shared across all characters on the Battle.net account.<br />
<br />

Warlock Instant CS Macro<br />
Thanks for the report. We're looking into this and hope to have a fix soon.<br />
<br />
I've gone ahead and deleted the exploit from the earlier posts in this thread. For future reference, we have the ability to look at previous versions of posts, so if you do need to share information on how an exploit works, you can edit that information out once your post is made and we'll still be able to see it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/381440-urgent-warlock-instant-cs-macro/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300734979?page=2#24))<br />

Character / Items<br />
Hey can you fix the Noble's Fancy Boots from darkmoon faire vendor to be cosmetic? It's still labelled cloth for some reason.<br />
We hope to have this addressed in an upcoming patch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/622159647772815360))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
I'm really not supposed to reply on my personal account. Sometimes my enthusiasm gets the best of me and I do. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621915428214829057))<br />
<br />
Will this new feature allow for crossfaction arenas? Hate being tied to one faction because everyone else is<br />
No, the intent of this feature is to reduce queue times for battlegrounds and Ashran. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/621892201073618944))<br />
<br />
.Will certain class/race combos always trigger other races in Merc Mode? ex Troll/Shaman always Dwarf, or will it be random?<br />
You will be changed to a different race based on your class. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/621892389985103872))<br />
<br />
considering mercenary mode for rated content? Alot of comic books have horde and alliance fighting on the same side in arenas.<br />
No we are not. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/622041090309275648))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Failed the naval mission for the Black Market AH item. I thought failed missions could be retried? It's not available anymore<br />
It will come back, but you may have to wait a while. Not all missions reappear immediately if failed. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/621891954763141121))<br />
<br />
is there an ETA on fixing the Spirit Lodge/Mage Tower constructs? They haven't worked since 6.2.<br />
This is slated to be addressed in an upcoming patch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/622159391060463617))<br />

<br />
I've hit that limit and it sucks. I won't be able to buy new tokens once the next expansion launches. That means I'll miss out on cheap tokens again. I bought most of the 36 tokens for 40-50k each. I'd rather have blizzard not put a hard limit on token purchases. I need to get rid of my gold before it becomes inflated D:</div></div><hr />

It's so easy to make gold these days, who is selling all those tokens?<br />
<br />
People with families and fulltime jobs who would rather spend their limited playtime on doing something fun instead of fooling around in their garrisons or playing the AH. And kids who only play this game for pvp who used to spend their allowance on gold from Chinese gold sellers. Even these days many players still struggle to make even 50k gold.</div></div><hr />

I have just over 1 million gold, play on Oceanic servers, and honestly 20k-30k per month isn't worth it for the current game.<br />

I bought WOD for $AUD 40 when tokens launched just so i could buy a few before they started rising (PLEX has risen 400% or more over the years).<br />

bought 14 at an average of 18k on two accounts and used 2 to try WOD for a couple of months. <br />

I'm buying with gold right now, but not for much longer, I don't make any more gold. Repair bills a going through the roof this expansion for some reason, and I only play for raids. I mean, exclusively for raids. I don't log otherwise, so gold doesn't generate. I will buy tokens until I run out of gold, then stop playing.</div></div><hr />

I was happy like you then I suddenly realised that it means working for blizzard and getting paid with tokens which means more time working hour to earn more tokens. Damn, I was transformed from customer to become worker/product of blizzard. Logging in and out garrison so that Blizzard can earn extra dollars for my gametime. <br />
<br />
There are people that have lots of gold and can buy tokens without extra work, these are customers.<br />
And there are people that log in extra hours to earn extra golds to buy tokens, these are called workers.</div></div><hr />

Because people who are not subscribed are not paying, which means their answer is not relevant to my question.</div></div><hr />

I have just over 1 million gold, play on Oceanic servers, and honestly 20k-30k per month isn't worth it for the current game.<br />

Yet you bother reading news about this game and complain about it when you are not playing it.Seems more like trying to persuade yourself you did the right thing by stopping.</div></div><hr />

Confirmation Bias.<br />
<br />
I loathe this game in its current state and I want to see others confirm my one sided opinion.<br />
<br />
I think that's why.<br />
<br />
I unsubbed, not gonna waste gold to resub, not until i see something interesting happen... which probably wont be any time this year.</div></div><hr />

N-/S-American zones tokens are much cheaper than elsewhere, so i assume this means they are bought for real money more in the americas.</div></div><hr />

Thats not a fair assumption. I havent resubbed because I dont like this expack but I keep looking for a reason to come back. Im sure Im not the only one who wants to come back but dislikes the current content other than Pepe, because Pepe is the best thing in WOD after getting to 100.</div></div><hr />

You are not alone in this. Just ignore the Blizzard apologists. They fail to grasp the simple concept of a snowball effect that every other MMO went through eventually... there is a critical mass size required for an MMO to stay alive *and* well. They also fail to grasp that we're at less than half the peak subscribers since it's best. This is not a good thing and encouraging people to leave or not come back does nothing to help &quot;make the game better&quot;.</div></div><hr />

After a decade, its okay if it starts to fade. It will eventually replaced with some other suitable time sink that is fresher and more appealing. Play until its no longer fun for you and move on. Others will do the same at their own pace. You don't get anything out of holding on beyond that point. Its not going to force thd game to be any better.</div></div><hr />

I lol'd at this. Figured it would stop all the moronic posts of people asking where certain options are but nope! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Where is the 'Unsubbed' option for the poll?<br />
<br />
<br />
Why isn't there a 3rd option in the poll? &quot;I have not subscribed to WoW over the past few months&quot;</div></div><hr />

I have to wonder what it is they have seen, that has caused them to limit the purchase of them with gold like this. Perhaps the percentage of people buying them is very low? Perhaps they may discontinue them in the future?<br />
<br />
Bliz may be second guessing the whole token thing, and whether it is actually retaining players the way they imagined it might. The initial cash flow may have been good, but if a small number of players are the ones primarily buying them up, then over the long run you are only guaranteed that small number of players will still be around. But then, limiting the purchasing of them, as people hit that limit, the market is gonna bottom out. unless of course people buying them with money, also goes down.<br />
<br />
It's like a double rainbow ... what does it mean?!<br />
<br />
looking forward to that august 4th call ...</div></div><hr />

WoD and the latest &quot;content&quot; patch (6.1 doesn't count for shit) have convinced me that Blizzard probably isnt ever going to get a real penny from me ever again. If and when I'm unable to make the gold necessary to pay for tokens (and they have and will make it more difficult to protect their new revenue stream) I will stop playing.<br />
<br />
Also: Flying already FFS. This whole expansion has been a recycled aborted joke.</div></div><hr />

That is a pretty lame conclusion you made; you don't throttle purchases because the buying is too low, it's because the buying is too high.</div></div><hr />

Small number (low percentage) of people buying lots of tokens, trying to manipulate the market is what i meant.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatakau</div><div class="date">2015-07-25, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played for two months using tokens, I last played 5 years ago and had 100k stored up (a lot of money back then) I then bought a month properly, two days ago I finally bought WoD for 20 quid and halfway to lv98 on one character and lv95 I think on another plus building up 4 garrisons. I've run the first three dungeons and they have to be some of the most boring instances I've ever run in my entire MMO gaming life (and I've played wow since day 1 including beta) Only good thing to come of this was getting the Ashes mount. I managed to see it drop and not scream like a little girl who's period had just started I simply thought, great don't have to run that anymore.</div></div><hr />

This thing right there just basically destroys shadow priests' survivability .. It was at garbage level already and now it would be almost impossible to 1v1 a melee.</div></div><hr />
