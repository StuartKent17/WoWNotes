World of Warcraft surpasses 11 million subscribers worldwide<br />
IRVINE, Calif. - October 28, 2008 - Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. announced today that the subscribership for World of Warcraft®, its award-winning massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), now exceeds 11 million players worldwide. This milestone was reached as the beta test for Wrath of the Lich King®, World of Warcraft's second expansion, nears completion. Wrath of the Lich King will launch in several regions around the world starting on November 13.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's been very rewarding to see gamers around the world continue to show such strong support for World of Warcraft,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment®. “We remain fully committed to responding to that enthusiasm with a high-quality, constantly evolving game experience.<br />
<br />
Since debuting in North America on November 23, 2004, World of Warcraft has become the most popular MMORPG around the world. It was the bestselling PC game of 2005 and 2006 worldwide, and finished behind only World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade®, the first expansion pack for the game, in 2007.* In addition to being the bestselling PC game of 2007 in both North America and Europe, The Burning Crusade holds the record for fastest-selling PC game of all time, with nearly 2.4 million copies sold in its first 24 hours of availability and approximately 3.5 million in its first month.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft was recently launched in Russia and Latin America, and is currently available in eight languages. In addition to North America and Europe, the game is played in mainland China, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile, Argentina, and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.<br />
<br />
To keep pace with the continued growth of World of Warcraft as well as development on other Blizzard Entertainment games, the company is currently hiring for numerous open positions. More information on available career opportunities at Blizzard Entertainment can be found at www.blizzard.com/jobs (http://www.blizzard.com/jobs).<br />

Blue posts<br />
Tabard of the Achiever and &quot;old&quot; tabards<br />
Yes you can delete them. While I do not recommend getting rid of the ones that are harder to pickup, you can even delete them before hitting the 25 tabard mark. I bought all of the easy to get tabards like Cenarion Expedition, Skyguard, Ogri'la, etc. and ended up at 24. So I sold these easy ones while I worked on the last one. Once I picked up the last one I got the achievement without re-purchasing the ones I sold.<br />
<br />
Once again though, I recommend not getting rid of any of the difficult ones to get in case this doesn't work out as planned. But grats to all those who are real achievers! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/11829579400-tabard-of-the-achiever-question.html))<br />

Retribution nerfs<br />
We could get a similar effect by changing Wisdom to base mana instead of total mana (because that is independent of the size of your mana pool with gear). As some players have pointed out, the risk would be that paladins feel that Wisdom is their only choice. <br />
<br />
[...] Just because you CAN be at the top of the damage meters doesn’t mean you WILL be at the top of the damage meters. That is a huge difference. But all many players hear is “I should be within 5% of the top rogue and hunter.”<br />
<br />
Overall, the design goal for Ret hasn’t changed. We want you to be brought for your dps if for example the raid already has all of your buffs. You were just too high before. Even less skilled Ret players were very high. Even ones with questionable gear.<br />
<br />
[...] We tested quite extensively with the JotW change, down to changing the number by single percentage points until we found a number we liked.<br />
<br />
As far as multiple nerfs, we did try a few small changes when we made Divine Storm physical. It didn’t help much and Rets were still steamrolling other players and mobs. We needed to be more severe with the next round of changes.<br />
<br />
Remember why we made these changes: it was to lower your dps and mana regen, so yes, those two things should be lower. We raised Blood / Martyr to make sure you had an option to running out of mana (by e.g. spamming Consecration) by using these Seals and Judgements for your dps.<br />
<br />
I know some of you are saying you are still running out of mana by using only the core abilities I mentioned. But not everyone is finding that, so we need to keep investigating.<br />
<br />
Mana drains are still something we are looking at. We could also change those to a percent of base mana. But the effects seem to vary wildly with the hunter version being fairly powerful and the warlock version much less so. Yet we aren’t exactly trying to nerf hunters in PvP either so it’s a complex problem to solve.<br />
<br />
Making sure you aren’t waiting too long for cooldowns is something else we’re looking at. For example, we could lower the cooldown and effect of Judgements just so you are hitting the button more often.

Lack of proper role for Shadowpriests in raid in WotLK<br />
VT does a lot of damage, but that's the juice we gave Shadow to be able to compete on the damage meters. We don't think it's a problem, at least for now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/11829509263-shadowpriests-have-no-role-in-raiding-proof.html))<br />

Change to shards not before WotLK<br />
I said down below somewhere that we have some ideas on shards. It's not going to be a fix you'll see before Lich King ships though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/11829378987-so-about-that-soulshard-rework.html))<br />

WoW TCG - Drums of War now available<br />
The new WoW TCG expansion &quot;Drums of War&quot; has been released in store yesterday, it's now a matter of hours before you start seeing the loot cards from this set in this game. As a reminder : <br />
<br />
The Red Bearon<br />
The Red Bearon is the latest in epic mounts, and one of the easiest ways in Azeroth to score a bear mount! “The Battle Bear” is the fourth exclusive mount from the World of Warcraft TCG, and continues the tradition of giving players access to unique and exciting mounts. Similar to previous Loot card mounts, The Red Bearon Loot card unlocks the ability for players to purchase either a normal or an epic version of this mind-blowing mount. <br />
<br />

<br />
Owned! <br />
This uncommon Loot card offers the newest in victory flaunting. Used in-game, this card gives you “The Flag of Ownership,” and will tell everyone that you just bested your opponent. In addition to a special emote, you will literally plant a flag in the corpse of your fallen enemy. As if that wasn’t enough, the flag flies a giant thumbs down, the ultimate in humiliation. <br />
<br />

<br />
Slashdance<br />
This super common Loot card gives players a stack of Party G.R.E.N.A.D.E.S., complete with targeting circle! Aim carefully at a glum group of characters and then throw your grenade. Everyone in the target circle will receive a one minute “buff” that causes them to dance ‘til there’s a smile on their face! Not only will all the targeted characters bust a move, they will also get to enjoy some streamers and confetti, making it a real party! <br />

Now I'm pretty sure they'll reach 12M or even 13M easily in the months after the launch of the expansion.<br />

So, where are all those people who said : &quot;WAR will be the WoW killer ?&quot; :-)<br />

<br />
<br />
Well WAR has 750.000 accounts (according to official numbers). It cannot be verified and it would be in their best interest to overestimate it so we cannot be sure.<br />
<br />
But even if this number is true then it is rather low. It's enough to make it a successful MMO but certainly not enough to be a WoW-killer. And they are talking about &quot;consolidating&quot; realms... so to be clear it means some people are leaving WAR and some servers are empty enough to justify their merging with a bigger one.</div></div><hr />

i played WAR for the first month... got bord, canceled my subscription. it got old way too fast. maybe once they fix it up it will be better but all it is for now is a grindfest / pvp game just like guildwars, fury &amp; a few others.</div></div><hr />

And you know what was the answer of the lead designer ?<br />
<br />
&quot;We won't nerf anybody, we'll just buff everyone instead !&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, it sure is an answer that will please the 13 year old children but it is not a good way to balance a game... Even if we all hate it when Blizz nerf our class, we all have to admit they are doing a good job. I mean, it's the only MMO I know where the class representation is so balanced. I mean every class is close to 11% representation (hunter at 15% and shaman at 8% but they are exceptions and not really too far from the average).</div></div><hr />

UO never came above 250K subscribers. (300K at most)<br />
And it's still alive, though bleeding a slow agonizing death at the hands of EA. <br />
70K and going down. Most of those are people with multiple accounts.</div></div><hr />

This is nothing more than a big &quot;FUCK YOU!&quot; to all the people who QQ then move on to say &quot;I QUIT!! BLIZZ I QUIT!&quot;. I wonder, are we going to get these press releases every 1,000,000 subscribers? I remember the 10,000,000 one still, fresh in my memory.<br />

<br />
Actually, its not misleading at all, they've always said that the number of subscribers they report is defined by the number of active accounts at whatever time they make the count. The fact that the accounts may belong to gold farmers and spammers is immaterial, it is still and active account. To be honest, its also the most accurate count you're going to be able to get of from any game as to who is playing. Any MMO company that doesn't report figures in that way I would take to be lying about their numbers, actually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most the WoW folks I know IRL don't pay $14.99 either. We all pay $13.99 for 3 month recuring and I have on two occasions now used a 6 month sub at $12.99. Then I'd imagine a large majority of folks pay with a credit card, and so you have the credit companies skimming a little off the top there aswell.</div></div><hr />

The announcement is filler to announce the game's release date, that way if it's picked up right by news outlets it's free advertising. That's why they announced at 10k too, wasn't that the announcement of the expansion? <br />
<br />
Simple, clever marketing.<br />

As stated earlier, that's in the region of $165,000,000 a month. Add the (roughly) $75 for initial purchase and expansion pack, and that's an additional $825,000,000 over the last 4 years.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now let's say they're half-BSing (like many of you have said) and the actual of paying customers is closer to 7 million.<br />
7,000,000*15/month = 105,000,000/month.<br />
<br />
Let's say it's not 15/month, but closer to 10/month<br />
7,000,000*10/month = 70,000,000/month<br />
Still before initial purchases<br />

[...] The result is a reliable stream of profits – a projected operating profit of $517 million this year on revenue of $1.1 billion, most of it from &quot;World of Warcraft.&quot; That's an operating profit of 47 percent, which compares to 21 percent last year for Vivendi overall, 5 percent for Activision and 2 percent for rival Electronic Arts, which will drop to No. 2 in game sales after the merger goes through.

So in 12/07 they were projecting to make a cool half billion.<br />

People will always move on to new games. The impressive thing about WoW is how they still manage to keep finding new subscribers. The really interesting thing about WoW isn't that it has eleven million players. The really interesting thing is that ten years ago, there were barely even one million players combined for all MMOs. Regardless of whether those new 'converts' stick to WoW, it's still a good thing for the genre. It's getting more attention and more players.

They won't. Blizz has been moving away from giving things only to a small portion of their userbase (e.g. welfare arena epics, badge gear, etc), the only way that a lot of people could get such items would be to go back in time and buy the game earlier.<br />

No surprise there.<br />
<br />
With all these money flowing in, perhaps they'll spend more to make the game more stable.. otherwise it's not going to be just 11M subscribers, but 11M &quot;ANGRY&quot; subscribers.<br />
<br />
Simple truth is.. WAR sucks.. I spent $50 just to try it and I played for about 2hours till I called it quits..<br />
It's no where near in the area of being called &quot;WoW killer&quot; Not even close.<br />
<br />
Aion, however, is something I'm really looking forward to. Perhaps that'll be the next &quot;WoW killer,&quot; but I have a feeling that by the time it gets released, either blizzard will already have moved on to something more interesting than WoW or close it up altogether due to angry subscribers due to instability of the game and lack of class balance.</div></div><hr />

The only thing that will kill WoW is Blizzard's next MMO (Diablo III may take some people away from WoW too)<br />

diablo 3 , wont kill or harm wow.. <br />
its not the same game..<br />

if you cant play 2-3 game simultaneously , you shouldnt play at all.. <br />

<br />
idk. but theres no way im gonna listen to blues talk about waiting til 80 to see how skill and gear works out. ret doesnt wear int. period. gear is irrelivent when it comes to the cost of spells. and yea they say we shouldnt heal or bless or cleanse or aoe... well if they want us to just judge, cs, auto attack... thats boring and the dps is gonna suck so nobody is gonna want to invite them over a raw dps class if they dont have mana to use their utilities... <br />
<br />
wake up blizzard... what they need to do is lower stun duration on hoj to fix pvp burst, and if we cant use our other spells in pve we better get another single target buton to smash or like they said, lower the cd on judge... but still im laughing at how they feel ret isnt gonna fall off the list of classes to invite, for pvp and pve. 1 per raid but only because holy sucks and the dps might be better than shadow priest but not hunter. ret doesnt bring kings either so thats one less reason to invite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It includes multiboxers, but realistically that number is fairly minimal. The random lowbies you run into in Orgrimmar or the welfare scrubs you meet in BGs don't bother with double accounts, and those make up the vast majority of the player base. Even most people in endgame raiding guilds don't bother with double accounts, so the number will be small. Shouldn't be even remotely close to a million.<br />

Inactive accounts aren't included, so unless you could log in right this very second, your account isn't included. Gold farmers and spammers are a disappearingly small number. How many people do you think actually buy gold in WoW? How many people do you know who have? Not even close to one percent. How many gold buyers do you think it takes to sustain a gold farmer, taking into account that they have to pay the monthly fee, rebuy the game when banned, pay for computers, Internet access, someone to actually farm (or watch over the bots), etc. Realistically, all their accounts combined won't exceed 10k, you just notice them a lot because their business is based on being noticed.<br />

That doesn't mean Blizzard actually ends up with all that much money. Most people don't pay for one month at a time. A lot of people get free months from recruiting friends and using scrolls of resurrection. The free days they hand out when servers are down or unstable will cut into profits, and I've gotten more than a month worth of one day exempts since I started playing. That's a disgusting amount of money worth of play time given away for free, and they still have to pay for the servers and service during that time. In addition to keeping realms up and going, they also have to pay the whole development team working on patches and bug fixes and such. They need to pay for PTR servers, forum servers, armory servers, etc along with people to code and maintain these.</div></div><hr />

And, even under &quot;conservative&quot; consideration, it seems quite realistic to me. Only taking into account the ammount of players I know, the places they live, their age, jobs, families etc., I can (not scientifically, but at least personally) see how WoW has become such a huge game - people playing it are practically everywhere. While it might still be rare to find a 50 year old housewive or an investment broker (might see some more of those trying to escape reality in the last few weeks, though ^^) playing, it HAS happened. Apart from the vast majority of students arround 16-25, I also happen to know younger kids playing the game (quite sucessfully so), mid-30s construction-workers, 40+year-old network-admins, independent gaming girls aged 16-25 and also girlfriends or wives of pretty much every male gaming group there is. A few people in the raid I lead actually have asked me to rezz them rather than walking after a wipe so they get a few minutes to look after the kids (angry wives can be more painful to gaming then angry raidleaders, I guess ^^).<br />
Every sort of gender, age, education or lifestyle is gathering. And even though the majority of players still belongs to the &quot;core&quot;-group of gaming, this core-group has expanded quite a lot since videogaming started to become interessting during the 1980s.<br />
<br />
The &quot;art&quot; of WoW is to make a product that does cater to ALL these people. That is something NO other product so far has managed. Its comparable in this respect only to the Sims, which, for different reasons, obviously, has managed to attract customers far beyond the definition of a classic player base. Achieving this task is much more impressive with a game that brought with it a whole new set of problems that were, at least in this dimension, unforseeable. The ammount of development Blizzard has put in making a (generally) stable, balanced, secure, hardly-ever-bugging game for many million people playing is not to be underestimated. As always, they didn't invent the wheel - they never did, neither with Warcraft, nor with Diablo, nor with WoW. They just took a lot of old wheels, looked at them, and made them so much BETTER then before, that only now one notices how bumpy wheels had been before, and how smooth WoW really is.<br />
<br />
People criticising this game generally fail to see how much they already have grown accustomed to this &quot;smootheness&quot;, and how they take it for granted now. They think that, since they are getting bored, Blizzard should take a 4 year old game and suddenly turn it from a wheel into a hovercraft. But thats not gonna happen. No one is forced to stay with the game, and people can be expected to leave; still, as long as it works, there are still lots of people having TONS of fun with it, and blizzard is bringing in a massive ammount of interessting features about every patch.<br />
<br />
WAR and Conan failed to make a game as smooth or as fun as WoW. They failed because they pushed out unfinished and buggy products into a market where they already stood up against the competition of the rather close-to-perfect WoW. They failed because they promised to be the next big thing, but in the end lacked the vision and novelty that WoW had, and still has. If there is to be a WoW-killer, it will have to be a game that is so well rounded, so perfect that about everything you do as a WoW-veteran will make you say: &quot;Geez, of course! Why didn't WoW have that?&quot; That was about the feeling I had when playing Diablo 2, where I wondered how much more one could get out of the fun but old concept of Diablo. It was the same with Warcraft 3. And it will be the same neither with WAR, nor Conan, and most likely not Aion. It will be the same with the next MMO Blizzard decides to push out. Because no matter how many greedy capitalist arses run that company: They STILL make fantastic games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The world's population is estimated at 7 billion. If the 11 million is true, then that means 1 in every 1571 people play world of warcraft.<br />
<br />
That's pretty hardcore. Thing I'm wondering is why blizzard hasn't already bought a country or something.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps there's hidden messages in the spells and every time you use them, your mind absorbs the messages without you realizing it. Maybe there's messages everywhere you go, who knows.<br />
<br />
And perhaps, WoW isn't the only game that has subliminal messages, maybe Wc3, SC, Diablo also have them.<br />
<br />
Let's be realistic people, there IS subliminal messages in these games, don't deny it, don't lie to yourself!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. I played Conan. The biggest problem was the bugs, the crashes, the 25 gigs of hard drive space, the 2 gigs of ram it needs, and the lack of content.<br />
<br />
Gear also didn't matter, and it sucked.<br />
<br />
You know what the WoW killer is going to be? Another Blizzard game.<br />
<br />
Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, this un-announced MMO. All these games will take massive chunks from WoW's population. Why? Because they will be quality, polished, finished games.<br />
<br />
And Diablo 3 is going to be fucking epic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah it will. At some point, it will be earning less than it costs and then Blizzard will kill it. You honestly think we'll still be playing THIS game in fifty years time?<br />
<br />
Blizzard won't die for a very, very, very long time I assume; and neither will the Warcraft IP - but WoW won't last anywhere near so long as either of those brands.</div></div><hr />
