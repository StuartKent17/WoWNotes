The Armor Showroom is finally updated ! It took a lot of time because the whole code had to be changed, it will be a lot easier to update it, and it shouldn't be a problem for the next patch. 
 
New Features 
Screenshots are now direct render from the game, showing a few things that wowmodelviewer can't show. (A few light effects on some sets like the tier 6 priest)  
The page won't &quot;reload&quot; on set change," />

The Armor Showroom is finally updated ! It took a lot of time because the whole code had to be changed, it will be a lot easier to update it, and it shouldn't be a problem for the next patch.<br />
<br />
New Features<br />
Screenshots are now direct render from the game, showing a few things that wowmodelviewer (http://www.wowmodelviewer.org) can't show. (A few light effects on some sets like the tier 6 priest) <br />
The page won't &quot;reload&quot; on set change, only if you decide to check another class. This should make the browsing a lot more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Todo list<br />
2.0.1 (Today, or tomorrow) : Re add the Dungeon Set 3, fix the name of the window. <br />
2.1.0 (A bit later) : Use more relevant classes for each set. (A human wearing Horde PvP is definitely weird)<br />
2.2.0 (Much later) : Support for all races. <br />
<br />
Website<br />
Yesterday downtime was like a night with me. Not enjoyable for both sides. <br />
I apologize for the multiple crashes, everything should now be fixed and the tooltips were fixed to change a few things. Icons and tooltip background should be shown properly, and you should have decent tooltip layout on every page now. Please report any bug you may find in comments, thanks<br />

Mage PvP Guide<br />
Tarde (mage from SK-Gaming) posted a Mage PvP Guide (http://www.sk-gaming.com/feature/839/) on their site. It's not going into intensive theorycrafting but it's definitely a good read if you're a mage willing to survive this cruel world.</div></div><hr />

Agree with previous comment, great site. Visit it daily since I 'discovered' it! :)<br />
But Im having trouble with the pictures not loading in the Armor showroon 2.0 aswell, don't know if it's on my end (surfing from a websense controlled network) or if it's on your end or if it's intended not to show :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for a great and interesting site anyways, keep it up! :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-07-04, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">which pictures ? <br />
<br />
Edit : Naburi, it will depends of the amount of space it takes on the page layout, but I'll think about it :p</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mantisen</div><div class="date">2007-07-04, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I meant (can't speak for Naburi) the pictures of the armor sets.<br />
I.e, when entering the Shaman section of the armor showroom the tier 4 picture is displayed.<br />
If I then click any other armorset, like tier 5, 6, pvp, etc, the picture disappears and the space is left empty so no cool picture for me to see :(. This is a minor thing, love the info etc so it's all good if it's not possible to display the looks of all the different tier sets. I just thought it might be a glitch since<br />
the picture names of the tier5 sets etc are present in the code and I can see the set looks by just copy pasting the link to the picture :).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naburi</div><div class="date">2007-07-04, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was talking about de whole picture of a set, tier 6,5,4, arena, etc...<br />
<br />
But its' also korrect, some times when i check 1 item in a set, the detail is flipping and i cannot read the detail, but iff i scroll a bit higher/lower it works</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tylerlee</div><div class="date">2007-07-04, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only tier 4 warrior pic shows for me, 5,6, pvp, areana gear dont bring up a pic.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-07-04, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll try to get this fixed asap, weird. ^^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Djaevlen</div><div class="date">2007-07-04, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also you might wanna know that the Priest Arena Season 2 gloves are not similar skin-wise, the +healing ones are abit &quot;fat&quot; where the +dmg ones are slim. Check AtlasLoot in-game if you dont understand</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ubermonkey</div><div class="date">2007-07-04, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Change the background color. With a black background it's very hard to see details. Also, please change the model. Why did you choose the GAYEST looking human face possible with a mustache? come on</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fastjack</div><div class="date">2007-07-04, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it a lot. Just needs the different races included. Wanna see a purple Paladwarf like my own. It would be perfect then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm french, this fact itself explains a lot of thing.<br />
<br />
About the black background, I'm working on something to switch it to gray or something, but it's not that easy. ^^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mantisen</div><div class="date">2007-07-05, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with the armors not showing sometimes in the armor showroom is not a problem on your (or the sites) end.<br />
Tested it from home and it worked fine, problem is probably at my works end - Im stuck with IE6 and the traffic is<br />
controlled by Websense. I'd bet that has something to do with it (probably IE as usual), suspected<br />
it wouldn't have anything to do with your awsome site ;)<br />
Keep it up :)<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Managed to install Firefox at my work computer, armor showroom working fine here aswell now! :) I don't know why companies persist<br />
in installing Internet Explorer when there's an alternative like Firefox out there :)</div></div><hr />
