I think it's too bad, I really liked it.</div></div><hr />

What no way! It was 10x better only thing I was looking forward to in 8.1 seriously the only reason I leveled my paladin</div></div><hr />

Not only it looked ugly and silly, but it made all the other projected textures (that often show something deadly) virtually invisible.<br />
<br />
The flames were fine, the weird picture not.</div></div><hr />

Visual changes never appeared in the patchnotes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eggroll</div><div class="date">2018-12-12, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Way too flashy and show offy.</div></div><hr />

So it's perfect for Paladins, right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zephire</div><div class="date">2018-12-12, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate the new wings. I admit an update was justified but this is just silly. It's not even close to what I've been playing with all these years. They've removed a core part of my joy for paladin. Now we have something making us more bulky, taking more space and doesn't flow well when fighting at all. They'll never add a glyph for the old look since it goes against how clearly you see the wings now.<br />
<br />
I don't usually care and most changes seem reasonable but this is an abomination. Give me back my up right wings but updated!</div></div><hr />
