Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles<br />
Blizzard's new arena opened this weekend for the Overwatch Contenders Season One Playoffs (https://www.overwatchcontenders.com/en-us?skiplanding=true)! <br />

Game Developer Tweets<br />
From your answer about mistakes new game designers make you mentioned “Not recognizing that they have reached a point of diminishing returns.” Can you explain what that means?<br />
As a developer, there are a limited number of hours in the work week (even if you willingly work extra hours, which a lot of Rioters do). If you are spending your time on problem X, then you aren’t spending your time on problem Y.<br />
<br />
If you get problem X to a solution that you would grade as an 85% in a day, and it takes you another day to get it to 90%, then you’re only improving it by 5% a day compared to your original output of 85% a day. That’s the diminishing returns part. Your efficiency drops to the floor, particularly compared to other projects you could be working on.<br />
<br />
Now I’m not advocating shipping crappy, half-baked, or phoned-in designs. But in this business hitting 100% is almost never realistic, and the cost of hitting 100% isn’t worth it when you consider the opportunity cost of what you’re not doing in the same window. You have probably heard the phrase “The enemy of good is perfect.”<br />
<br />
Junior designers mismanage this all the time. They get so excited about their project that they don’t want to live within any constraints. They are completely focused on how awesome their project is and lose sight of the cost of that project (in terms of their time).<br />
<br />
I once spent several days setting up a battle between two NPCs that was just background action for players to make it feel like a battle was raging all around them. It looked really cool, but it took a long time to set up. If this was the climax of a big moment, then maybe that expenditure was worth it. Or maybe I should have spent that time to set up two different battles that would have more impact on players in the long run.<br />
<br />
Another way this manifests is when a junior designer spends too much time trying to save a flawed concept rather than recognizing that it probably can’t be saved without weeks of work and that they would be better off to consider alternative concepts.

Ghostcrawler is like old women front of their house... when you leave your house and they accost you from the other side of the street: &quot;Do you go away, son?&quot; &quot;Yes, I do...&quot;<br />

Who cares? They are generic game development questions, hes a game developer. Most don't openly chat about stuff, so it's nice to hear from a game developer to see behind the curtain a bit. It's easy to scroll past it if you don't care.</div></div><hr />

It's probably easier to stop being butt hurt. Maybe if you and others didn't have such an irrational haterection for the guy you'd see that they're usually filled with interesting tidbits of information in regards to MMOs and gaming in general from someone who has authority to talk about such things.</div></div><hr />

Except..what he said is 100% correct and you’re just a hater hating on something because YOU are butthurt. Don’t get it twisted. There is absolutely nothing invalid about the points he made, and it’s true in many aspects of adult* life. <br />

<br />
Have you ever heard of a director? That's exactly what they do. Though I'm not really sure where you get the notion of them &quot;sitting back;&quot; they're in charge of directing everybody and wrangling the different aspects. Games aren't made without directors, because otherwise you have no way to tie the whole thing together. Show me an artistic project without a director and I'll show you a project that's never going to be done. <br />
<br />
<br />
The industry is plagued with this garbage slave-master mentality that ownership supersedes work effort. Owning property does not grant you wealth, and holding a position does not grant you a paycheck.<br />
<br />
Again, the position of &quot;director&quot; says otherwise.<br />
<br />
<br />
None of these hacks would even entertain the thought of voluntarily working unpaid overtime anyway. They'll just make some poor unpaid intern or underpayed employee do it for them, or worse pay off some chinese or koreans.<br />
<br />
Why the hell should they work unpaid overtime? They're BUSINESS PROFESSIONALS that do these jobs. They have made it their profession to work in this industry; expecting people to work unpaid overtime is a very UNPROFESSIONAL thing for a business to demand of its workers. &quot;DO IT FOR THE ART!&quot; is a pathetic excuse when these people do these jobs not only for love of doing it but also for a paycheck. <br />
<br />
As far as interns go, I can't say for riot, but all Blizzard internships are paid. In fact, most big name studios in the video game and animation fields have paid internships these days. <br />
<br />
Frankly, do you have any inkling of how creative projects (or really, any project in a professional environment) are developed? You think they do so without deadlines? OF COURSE they have deadlines. <br />
<br />
You think pixar or disney makes animated movies with a &quot;it'll be done when it's done&quot; mentality? Blizzard might publicly announce that they'll release something &quot;when it's finished&quot; but make no mistake that they have an internal deadline set. <br />
<br />
Do you work in any capacity in a creative field? Because you sound an awful lot like an armchair game designer right now. In which case you should find this sentiment particularly applicable:<br />
<br />
<br />
Junior designers mismanage this all the time. They get so excited about their project that they don’t want to live within any constraints. They are completely focused on how awesome their project is and lose sight of the cost of that project (in terms of their time).<br />
<br />
You seem very disillusioned with what it takes to make the creative industry run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My dude, the principles of diminishing returns are extremely relevant to any kind of project management, especially software development and your brain damage is most certainly not caused by reading ghostcrawler's text based on your objections.<br />
<br />
At some point, you are spending more time polishing a feature than it took to develop it in the first place. If people were happy with it at 80% and more happy with it at 95 or 100%, was that the most efficient use of your time when you could have switched gears and developed a whole entirely different feature that might make other people happy as well?<br />
<br />
The rest of your point about unpaid overtime is borderline incomprehensible and certainly irrelevant to the discussion of &quot;At what point are you better off stopping work on a feature to move onto something else?&quot;</div></div><hr />

I'm going to have to agree, Ghostcrapper clearly states the most bullshit I've ever read...in what industry is it ever ok to aim for 85%??? The fact his philosophy is fuck it close is good enough blows my mind, like dumb hicks play horse shoes no one else.</div></div><hr />

Fuck that shit. I don't wanna crap on Ghostcrawler, because I often enjoy reading what he has to say. But not this time.<br />
<br />
When I was a kid, my dream was getting a job in the gaming industry (in a place like Blizzard), or even having my own game company.<br />
<br />
My perspective has shifted completely. Between the extra hours, the deadlines, the money-grabbing business practices, and the extremely toxic environment perpetuated by so-called gamers, working on gaming sounds like a fucking nightmare.</div></div><hr />
