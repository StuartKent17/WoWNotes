Update - The next Blizzcon has been announced, it will be held in Anaheim, California on October 10 and 11, see the Press Release (http://www.blizzard.co.uk/press/080512.shtml)<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
As I write this post, nothing is confirmed by Blizzard yet. However, final patch files have been made available and there isn't any reason for Blizzard to postpone it one more week. We can assume that patch 2.4.2 will be deployed this week on live servers and we'll probably get a confirmation very soon.<br />

Patch mirrors<br />
The patch isn't big and I suggest that you wait for the official download instead of using alternative download links, but if you really can't use the Blizzard Downloader the patches are mirrored below.<br />
<br />
Do not install this patch until the server downtime, otherwise you won't be able to connect until Tuesday/Wednesday on live servers<br />

<br />
Undocumented changes<br />
Most of the undocumented changes reported on PTRs are now part of the official patch notes<br />
<br />
Item additions<br />
A new PvP Trinket as been added to Honor Rewards Medallion of the Alliance (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/epicpvptrinket.jpg). There is obviously a horde version of the item and both of them cost 40 000 Honor Points. We don't know yet if it will be added at the beginning of 2.4.2, or if we'll have to wait for the beginning of Season 4 to be able to buy them. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Item Changes<br />
Naturalist's Preserving Cinch (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/naturalistcinch.jpg) and Borderland Fortress Grips (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/borderlandgrips.jpg) have been upgraded.<br />
[item=19169] now has a chance to fail for targets above level 60<br />
[item=19955] now grants 70 (instead of 400) spell haste rating, and reduces the mana cost of Rejuvenation, Healing Touch, Regrowth, and Tranquility by -5% for 15 seconds. (Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/zgtrinkets.jpg))<br />
[item=19958] now grants 70 (instead of 400) spell haste rating and reduces the mana cost of your healing spells by -5% for 15 seconds. (Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/zgtrinkets.jpg))<br />
[item=19954] energy bonus is now reduced by 4 points by level after level 60, lowering the energy bonus to 20 at level 70 instead of 40. (Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/zgtrinkets.jpg))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests changes<br />
The Quest &quot;The Multiphase Survey (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/multispectral.jpg)&quot;, where you retrieve surveys from Nagrand, no longer gives a [item=35232].<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions changes<br />
Jewelcrafting<br />
A new recipe has been added - Purified Shadowsong Amethyst (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/purifiedshadowsong2.jpg) (Reward from the Shattered Sun Offensive, Exalted reputation required)<br />
<br />
Leatherworking<br />
[item=34207] now requires 4x[item=23793] and 3x[item=22452] (instead of 18 Leathers and 14 Primal)<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing<br />
Blacksmiths are probably going to be happy, all their BOP Weapons have been changed and aren't unique anymore ! That's a nice change alone, but if you took the time to read the 2.4.2 Patch Notes you probably remember seeing something mentioning Main Hand weapons changed to One-Hand .... Well that's the case here, you can now dual-wield them (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/bopblacksmith.jpg) !<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/bopblacksmith_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/bopblacksmith.jpg)<br />
<br />
New Mounts<br />
According to spells and models available in the game files, at least two new mounts have been added but none of them have been discovered on PTRs. We might see them much later on live servers ... or never. <br />
<br />
Swift Zebra<br />
49322 : Swift Zebra - Summons and dismisses a rideable Swift Zebra. This is a very fast mount.<br />
<br />
Headless Horseman's Mount<br />
48023 : Headless Horseman's Mount - Summons and dismisses a rideable Headless Horseman's Mount.<br />
48024 : Headless Horseman's Mount, Ground - Summons and dismisses a rideable Headless Horseman's Mount.<br />
48025 : Use Headless Horseman's Reins<br />
<br />
The headless horseman mount &quot;,Ground&quot; effect could be the sign of a flying mount, but obviously nothing is confirmed yet. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Mount enchantments<br />
Some changes have been made to replace trinkets boosting your mount's speed by &quot;mount enchantments&quot;, however we didn't see anything like that on PTRs and it will probably be added later in the game. You can still find some information about them in the PTR 2.4.2 Undocumented changes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=6699.0) post.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Arena Season 4<br />
The Season 4 starting date isn't known yet, however all the season 4 items were activated on PTRs during the 2.4.2 testing phase, we can assume it won't be too long before we see it on live servers after the deployment of the patch.<br />

<br />
<br />
Rating requirements<br />
While Season 3 is still going strong, we wanted to announce ahead of time the rating requirements that will be present for arena items once Season 4 begins. We also wanted to give everyone a heads up to some changes that will be in an upcoming patch, altering how points are gained and players are matched in the arena system. The patch with these changes is scheduled to release before the start of Season 4.<br />
<br />
First though, the rating requirement changes:<br />
<br />
When Season 4 begins, Season 3 items will be reduced in personal and team arena rating requirement to:<br />
Shoulders: 1950<br />
Weapon: 1800<br />
<br />
The new Season 4 items will have the below personal and team arena rating requirements:<br />
Shoulders: 2200<br />
Weapon: 2050<br />
Head: 1700<br />
Chest: 1600<br />
Legs: 1550<br />
Gloves: none<br />
Off-hand: none<br />
<br />
In addition, some of the Season 4 quality items that will be purchasable with honor will also carry a personal and team arena rating requirement:<br />
Boots: 1700<br />
Ring: 1650<br />
Bracers: 1575<br />
Belt: none<br />
Necklace: none<br />
Trinket: none<br />
<br />
The Season 2 items, which will move to the honor system when Season 4 begins, will continue to have no rating requirement.<br />
<br />
The changes to the rating requirements for these items reflect the nature of the items, their power, and the relative difficulty that should be had when attempting to obtain them. These items are comparable to those found in the newest 25 person raid zone, Sunwell Plateau, and should therefore also feel very challenging to obtain.<br />
<br />
To help ensure that the challenge in obtaining these items stays true to those achieving these ratings, we'll also be implementing new rules with an upcoming patch to curb practices that undermine the core concepts of the arena system. These rules are as follows:<br />
If a character’s personal rating is more than 150 points below the team rating, they will earn points based on their personal rating instead of the team rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This means that a player cannot join a highly rated team and begin earning points based purely on the pre-established rating of the team before they joined it. They'll need to compete, improve, and gain a personal rating worthy of the points they would receive.<br />
If the average personal rating of the players queuing for a game is more than 150 points below the team’s rating, the team will be queued against an opponent matching or similar to the average personal rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This means that players cannot join a highly rated team and immediately face highly rated opponents, easily and quickly bringing their personal rating up. Instead they'll need to again compete, improve, and earn their rating.<br />
<br />
We're excited to see these changes implemented, which will continue to emphasize the strong competitive nature of the arenas, and the challenge in obtaining the highest end rewards available for PvP. <br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/may/mlgbig.gif (http://www.mlgpro.com/2008pccircuit/generalrules)<br />
NEW YORK (May 12, 2008) – Major League Gaming (MLG), the professional videogame league, today announced the launch of the MLG PC Circuit played on HP Blackbird 002. The kick-off event will be held alongside MLG’s Pro Circuit event in San Diego June 13-15 and will feature Blizzard Entertainment®’s World of Warcraft®: The Burning Crusade® and over $20,000 in prizes. <br />
<br />
“We’ve just come off our Meadowlands season opener, which attracted a record-setting 12,000 players and fans. Working with industry leaders HP and Blizzard Entertainment will allow us to reach more of America’s 40 million competitive gamers,” said Matthew Bromberg, CEO of Major League Gaming. <br />
<br />
The 2008 MLG PC Pro Circuit competitions will be played entirely on HP Blackbird 002 gaming PC’s. Created with gamers in mind, the award-winning HP Blackbird 002 Gaming PC is highly configurable and features liquid cooling and innovative thermal chambers to keep critical components cool while running next-generation games or other demanding computing tasks. <br />
<br />
“HP is bullish on PC gaming across the globe and we’re honored to help MLG as it launches their new North American circuit,” said Rahul Sood, chief technology officer, Voodoo Business Unit, HP. “The HP Blackbird 002 was designed specifically for this level of intense competition. We can’t wait to see to see MLG contestants pwning their opponents with it.”<br />
<br />
The first MLG PC Circuit event features Blizzard Entertainment’s World of Warcraft, the world’s most popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game, with more than 10 million players worldwide. The MLG PC Circuit will continue throughout the 2008 MLG season with additional stops in Orlando and Dallas, and other PC titles may be added in the future. The expansion of MLG into PC gaming competition leverages two of its competitive gaming sites, GotFrag.com (http://www.gotfrag.com), the leading PC-gaming coverage site, and MMO-Champion.com (http://www.mmo-champion.com), a leading World of Warcraft competitive strategy site. San Diego tournament coverage will be broadcast live on GotFrag.com (http://www.gotfrag.com) all weekend long, with more than 20 hours of live programming and expert commentary. <br />
<br />
The live broadcast of the first 2008 MLG Pro Circuit competition in March generated more than 750,000 video streams, 130,000 hours of video and over 600,000 on-demand views on MLGPro.com (http://www.mlgpro.com/2008pccircuit/index). <br />

Because some don't like farming badges, and there is no healing cloak ;)<br />
<br />
- Edit: pvp healing cloak without spending badges<br />
Besides there is new stuff coming for every slot, save for the cloaks?</div></div><hr />

It is likely that his polymorph still heals. If not, it can make the encounter quite difficult for lowish DPS teams that lack interrupters.</div></div><hr />

I started downloading a 15mb patch this morning before work. Seems really small but I guess there weren't many changes in this patch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulstorm</div><div class="date">2008-05-13, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been on the test servers and tryed out the new stuff and such, but the idea about it was indeed to test out merciless stuff.<br />
<br />
My warrior is mostly vengeful, sword too. But on the test servers I bought Merciless Sword x2 just to check the dps. It seemed okey, but missing the Berserker Rage + Cleave + Sweeping Strikes + Whirlwind + alot of other talent buffs and trinkets..<br />
<br />
But what I'm trying to tell is: Should I save my honor points for WLK, or buy the swords for faster levling in WLK.<br />
<br />
Same goes for my hunter and shaman, should I save my points, or should I get the stuff now?<br />
<br />
(I'm most playing on my alts and doing Daily Quest, so don't give any &quot;Best for PvP&quot; answers plx :P )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulstorm</div><div class="date">2008-05-13, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Idd I just did, and I expected something like that.<br />
<br />
I have no idea of they will remove my current points with the release of WLK, but I don't really enjoy having green/blue gear on my alts, and then I get 1-2 epic that really won't change the damage.<br />
<br />
I like levling, and I want to level fast. So if you can see the difference between 60 dps and 97 dps, that's a lot imo.<br />
But it would be a big advantage to have some points now that I can spend at 80.<br />
As I like to level, I play on my alts = less time to my 70s.<br />
The weapons I will get by honor/arena points will ONLY be used for speed-up levling, so I myself think it would be better to save them, but still..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">overneathe</div><div class="date">2008-05-13, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man WotLK's not coming out for at least 5 months. I hope you understand that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there's a person out there, not indeed wanting WLK to come now, I wonder what that reason could be.. (okey okey you just got your full set/not killed all bosses yet :P)<br />
<br />
The only reason imo, for WLK not to come yet (exept it's not done yet..) is that Kil'jaeden hasn't been killed yet.<br />
Btw, just found out how overpowered a 50 rogue with 375 engi can be... 1shoting some ppl with the Goblin Rocket Launcher. Much more fun than twinking! Also got rocket boots on it so yeah, can avoid some hard targets! :)<br />
Well I made my decision, waste my Arena Points, and save my honor points. (Think I can get back that points before WLK^^)</div></div><hr />

When a message appears in your chat window, if it is considered long enough to be more than one line, it now has hanging indents, which means every line after the first line is indented in. The reasoning I think for this is because if you type something, then a bunch of lines, it will put whatever else you say on the next line, and its possible to make it look like another person is talking this way, and this change eliminates that exploit.</div></div><hr />

Is it realy instant or just saying it in the spell description? I heard it isnt instant and if Blizzard removed it form patch notes then it looks like they became reasonable. This instant fear just srews over ferals and is not half as usefull against resto druids; this change wouldn't stop all the qq's against resto druids.</div></div><hr />

do you have any idea what fun it is if every lvl 61-70 hunter in AV spams first scare beast if he sees a feral? and no, you wont have every hunters castbar on your screen to shift in time into human form. THATS WHY THEY DIDNT LET IT GO LIFE!!<br />

Lol, ppl you rly dont understand me. I have 75K honor and 5K arena points on my ALT now.

When S4 starts you will be able to buy S4/S3 Arena gear with Arena points, S2 Arena gear with honor/marks, and Guardian's and Vindicator's gear for honor/marks, with the latter being reduced in price, comparable to the Veteran's at present.</div></div><hr />

On the upside, I've nearly hit the honor cap for the second time after speed levelling my Druid to 70 in advance of the last &quot;best guess&quot; date for Season 4. Should be able to hit S4 with 4 items bought, capped honor and 2k Arena Points :)</div></div><hr />
