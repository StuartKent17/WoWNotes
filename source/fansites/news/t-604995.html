The armor set-models simply fail. Ok cloth shoulders and some of the plate gear is a good idea but hell, they don't even compare to ANY of the previous sets like S3 or T6(i didn't love T6 but it's at least very detailed etc.).<br />
<br />
Blizzard gave one T6 armor set more love than all of those new ones together. Just look at the textures etc. What the hell were they thinking? Did the designers take crack and use their eyeballs to color/create those textures?<br />
<br />
My main is a rogue and seriously,... i almost got a heart attack after seeing the leather set that most likely will be ours (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/12_2.jpg) Geez! I didn't rly like our T5 Dr. Doom / Darth Vader set but somehow it's ok. And this? What the heck is that? Gasmask? Or what? Does this remind anybody of Sunwell/Bloodelf-styled-stuff? <br />
<br />
It's a joke!<br />
<br />
I welcome almost all changes that are coming with patch 2.4 but those sets deserve a NO THANK YOU!<br />
And that's why i gonna keep my Season 3/continue collecting it even when S4 is released!</div></div><hr />

Sure we do. You could have guessed that just by the fact that Blizzard already confirmed S2 buyable for honor next season. Would be kinda pointless if they made themselves reconfigure those npc's so they sell S2 etc. while everybody is lvling to 80 and would never even think about still getting that gear?<br />
<br />
Another hint that proves that wotlk is not going to be released before July is that there will be a &quot;hands-on-Wotlk&quot; in Paris during their convention in June. Would be kinda pointless too make that their greatest attraction in-spite of the fact that everybody is already playing the game at home...<br />
<br />
S3 was already released like 3 months ago, and if wotlk comes July+ thats exactly enought time for another season :-)<br />

Yeah, maybe you should make sure you don't look like a complete dumbass before you try to insult someone?<br />

And I already have the season 3 shoulders. I wasn't sure if season 4 would be out at level 70 or be after the expansion at level 80.

No, you can still rotate your character but you will have to do it yourself. As it is now your character is rotating automatically if your target is moving around you so you are always facing it without even touching your mouse. <br />
<br />
After patch you have to follow your target yourself because it could happen that it would run out of the cone where it's considered to be &quot;in front of you&quot;.</div></div><hr />
