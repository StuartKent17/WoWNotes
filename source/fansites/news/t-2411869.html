<br />
Why is your two button class design so popular?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SmashNDash15</div><div class="date">2018-07-16, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another stream for Lore to tell us how much he plays his shaman, Ion to answer questions we already know the answers to, and Taliesin to grab some material for another video. Fantastic!</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
No, because they might actually answer something more constructive, and Ion wants to model the Q&amp;As after his design philosphy: &quot;Ignore players as long as you can, change things only when backed into a wall&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Exactly this</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danuel</div><div class="date">2018-07-16, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One question. So horde is bad guys now?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kralljin</div><div class="date">2018-07-16, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One question. So horde is bad guys now?<br />
<br />
Please for fucks sake no lore question to Ion.<br />
<br />
Whether you like him or not, he has no clue about lore, the fact that he talked about &quot;It's shades of grey&quot; when referring to the RTS games is bogus, up until Warcraft 3 the lines were clear, Orcs = Bad, Humans = Good, even in Warcraft 3 they still painted some Orcs in a bad light, it was until TFT with the Orc campaign to paint the humans in a darker light (At least when acting against the Horde).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onikaroshi</div><div class="date">2018-07-16, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly this<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can you loot mounts you already have and not give them to people&quot;<br />
<br />
We feel that if you loot the mount a second time, you deserve to have that mount, and no one else can.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you removing fullscreen?&quot;<br />
<br />
We feel that it is unfair to players that some players get better frame rates by using 2 or more video cards<br />
<br />
etc etc lol.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bennett</div><div class="date">2018-07-16, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why won't Blizzard even acknowledge that the GCD is universally disliked and objectively bad for the game, and more importantly why does it seem Blizzard are completely deaf to player feedback regarding it? The system is horrible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They pick the questions to answer from a very long list.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc6d2ecbae4c</div><div class="date">2018-07-16, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damnit!<br />
<br />
I play Dark Heresy RPG on Thursdays :-(<br />
<br />
Guess ill have to watch the stream re-play when I get home ;-)<br />
<br />
And Ion is awesome, he has this sort of strange voice, that reminds me of some cartoon char I cant remember the name of.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Easo</div><div class="date">2018-07-16, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not Ion that's the problem. Its the really bad questions that get asked<br />
<br />
Man/woman/alien, the question you see are picked by Blizzard. It is not really hard to guess as to why they do that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gasparde</div><div class="date">2018-07-16, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My question: How many beard options will there be for Zandalari Trolls? What's your though process behind creating different beard styles?<br />
