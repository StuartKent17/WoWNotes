<br />
Yeah, we did not know that at the time, neither did anyone else in the house's guild.<br />
Edit: actually when we were killing him, we had had Flame Pillars on Melee and on Ranged groups before, so this was drawn for back then, before I realized they'd changed that part about him.<br />
<br />
Halfus up next though, so many drakes to draw, and such depressed orphaned whelps.<br />
Will try to remember to link them here or something of the sort at least, npnp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Strikes me as unlikely that a major content patch 4.1 which by definition of the last two expansions will unlock new raid tier content will be available within a few weeks. I would not be at all surprised to see patch 4.0.4 or 4.0.5 etc. However I'd guess that 4.1 is unlikely to be live before easter. Not least of which because if it has new raid content then its likely to be on the ptr for 4-6 weeks. So I could see patch 4.1 being on ptr in early March and launched in mid/late April. <br />
<br />
It just seems that the vast majority of players are just about to start raiding the new content and many are still struggling to complete heroics. So releasing a new tier is unlikely within a few weeks.<br />
<br />
That said its entirely possible that 4.1 will NOT contain a new tier of gear but instead will include all the stuff they didn't complete prior to Cata Launch.</div></div><hr />

We tryed this and he still chose melee. We even tryed all ranged dps to stand out and melee was nuked twice in the fight. You must have gotten lucky or somthing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Magmaw has no bottom, so he'd have to just tunnel through the ground as you walk, then just pop out of the round and be all happy smiley at everyone, just his squeals of delight as he pops up and greets everyone, all a-wavin his little armses around.<br />
At least that is how I'd vote for it to be.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalassocnus</div><div class="date">2011-01-02, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must say, the truly unique, although limited in scope, Magmaw tutortial was probably my fave of those shown.<br />
<br />
I, however, have an issue with the guide to Cata Hero: At least several of these, the difficulty rating foir the achieve seems made up on the spot: What metric is employed, and how to I evaluate it? As a scientist, I am firmly in the camp that lampoons such values by saying &quot;90% of all statistics are made up.&quot; In this case, the relative ease of completing the achievement in the manner as proscribed would be that easy ... except I do not think it is intended for the player to have to die to achieve it. In point, &quot;It's Frost Damage&quot; seems particularly hard, not only because Ripsnarl is one of the more difficult bosses, but because the instance itself is often laboriously complex with a gimmick fight (Foe Reaper) and al mechanical fight (Glubtok) preceding them, challenging classic players who are used to spank-and-tank and aoe. I would personally have been more careful in describing these achievements, and made it less about achieving the Drake and more about testing the mettle of those who attempt them (not cheating them, like the old &quot;trick&quot; on the Lich King chase in HoR by standing behind him).<br />
<br />
Some of them are often quite shy on details (I would have easily explained that several of these achievements can be completed OVER TIME, on different lockouts, while others can be completed after the instance is over, such as Extra Credit Bonus Stage -- which for the record, I've found well over 8 orbs, some of which don't require you to launch off the platforms in any way, or engage Altairus, etc.). Extra detail and completeness would have benefited this guide immensely.</div></div><hr />
