We have corrected an issue with the two-piece set bonus for the Paladin set, Conqueror’s Aegis. Holy Mending no longer costs additional mana.<br />
We recently made a change to the sell value of Nerubian Legguards. The material costs used to create this item were unintentionally low, and we were prompted to make changes to minimize the impact on the game's economy.<br />

Blue posts<br />
Rating requirements changes on ilvl 239 PvP Weapons<br />
We had to think pretty long term on this and make the change rather quickly before the PvP 239 items started flowing. The weapons on Algalon were included in other hard mode encounters so it doesn't require an Algalon kill to get them. Over time more than zero people will kill Algalon though and we should see a decent chunk of players with the ilvl 239 weapons, hopefully it's not too much though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/16904263617-arena-rating-system--requirement-changes.html))<br />
<br />
The balancing between PvE and PvP is an estimate on our side but we figured it was better to make the change now instead of waiting until a good chunk into the season or just waiting for next season. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16903573988-2350-rating-and-algalon-access.html))<br />
<br />
Healing in Raids<br />
Mimiron phase 2 is pretty insane to heal. But phase 1 and phase 3 feel pretty different. Then phase 4 is crazy again. Even in phase 2 a lot of the damage is avoidable. I know some players on this forum have felt before that they are still unfairly blamed when dps die when standing in fires, but in my experience, it's pretty easy to tell when someone failed to move out of the rockets.<br />
<br />
Another way to think about it is that in Naxxramas if you brought a healer to the raid for the first time, there aren't too many things you'd have to explain. &quot;Heal the MT,&quot; or &quot;Heal the raid,&quot; are plenty of advice for most fights. There's nothing wrong with that for the first tier of raid content. But in Ulduar there is more ebb and flow to the battle. You need to know when and where the big damage moments are coming. You need to know when to give it all you've got. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16904293997-we-actually-want-healing-to-be-less-spammy.html))<br />
<br />
Mana regeneration still powerful in Raids<br />
To be honest, despite all of the nerfs, mana regeneration still doesn't seem to be an issue for healers in Ulduar. You can often still afford to cast your largest heals and not care about overhealing because the risk of people dying feels like a far greater risk than running out of mana.<br />
<br />
We're not sure that will lead to us making any additional nerfs at this time (and Replenishment would probably be the target if we needed to.) So far we're really happy with how the various fights in Ulduar feel. There are very intense moments (like Frozen Blows) but there are breaks as well (in between Mimiron phases for example). Many of the fights are dynamic -- you heal in one fashion at times (say MT healing) and then another fashion at other times (say raid healing during add moment or big AE spells). There aren't too many times where you're just spamming your spells every cooldown or GCD, and when it happens it's not necessarily for too long.<br />
<br />
That said, we think we can still make healing more interesting. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16904263407-a-question-about-healing-direction.html))<br />
<br />
Boosting classes instead of nerfing them?<br />
If we were to do this, there would be more problems than you may first imagine. The problem here is this: As an example, take an ability that is a little too strong and performs with an advantage we did not foresee. If we were to fix this through only buffing classes or abilities to restore a little more order, then we would have to buff every other class in a way that made the original problem less of an issue. Performing multiple buffs across all classes to counter one 'overpowered' element is something that may only lead to further unforeseen issues. We may also end up with people running around with 90,000 hitpoints to counter the 23,000 crits flying their way... and whilst big numbers are fun, they are not necessarily the best solution.<br />
<br />
We do know that receiving a nerf is not the nicest feeling in the world, and that receiving a buff often makes your day much brighter, but ultimately changes are made in the most efficient and logical way possible.

Exorcism in 3.1.2 and 3.2<br />
We are considering making Exorcism not work against players or pets for 3.1.2. It would be a PvE only ability. In 3.2 we still intend to make it work differently. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904204830-simple-questions-regarding-balance-direction.html))<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
This was a bit annoying so glad it changed. The dps/healers in the gauntlet had to stay too far behind the tank due to this and in hardmode, every second counts. Was really crappy when they got a bit too close to see them get oneshotted all of the sudden.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Hi I'm in range now! let me run up to you with all my abilites on GCD so you get a free hit!&quot;<br />
<br />
I think the change they're talking about is the crit chance for slam and overpower being 100% after a charge in the arms tree. I don't wanna see it nerfed, but it probably could be. I say... 99.8% instead. *halo*</div></div><hr />

Take a chill pill, geez. Is a 15sec cooldown ability hitting around 2-3k non crit so extremely huge against the pets? So what, after this change I won't be able to use Exorcism on demons or undead? What kind of sense does that make?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously guys:<br />
<br />
In order for GC and Blizzard to even CONSIDER to make exorcism not work on pets, or to even REALISE that Exorcism was broken, it took:<br />
<br />
1. Perhaps 10 or 20 Hunters and Hunter alts (and God knows how many Warlocks) getting banned at the US and EU forums and the same number of threads getting locked, because they dared to suggest that Ret damage was way beyond OP, and that Ret itself is the most broken DPS spec ever to have hit the World of Warcraft since the &quot;World of Roguecraft&quot; fan movie three years ago.<br />
<br />
2. Still, after all the commotion, they are &quot;considering&quot; it.<br />
<br />
3. What will happen after this change, is basically that Rets will no longer be able to two-shoot (literally) Beast Mastery Cunning and Tenacity pets with 16k hit points. They will just four-shoot them, i.e. instead of spending two seconds to kill a BM tenacity or cunning pet, they will now spend four.<br />
<br />
After the above, and similar incidents in the past, am I unjustified to propose that Blizzard does not play their own game? Am I now?</div></div><hr />

Imho, you are right. Warriors are nowhere nearly OP as Rets are. Honestly, it's a fair fight versus a warrior. I feel it's like 50-50%. Rets though kill me in 6 seconds (non-stunned), and I have got exactly 864 resilience in PvP gear, not to mention Darkmoon Card: Berserker (another 35x3 resilience, total 969 resilience).<br />

<br />
It is easy to tell when someone failed to move out of the rockets - THEY DIE. The other avoidable damage in phase 2 is the laser, and you can tell when someone fails to move out of that as well - THEY DIE. <br />
So although it's technically correct to say &quot;a lot&quot; of the damage is avoidable, when the only avoidable damage in phase 2 is set in the millions-per-second it is, in practice, completely wrong. <br />
All of the actual damage to be healed is raid-wide and unavoidable random splash.<br />
<br />
That said, it makes me realise why they nerfed Ulduar when the post this Blue responds to essentially reads &quot;I don't know how to heal and this encounter is really hard for me, defend yourself.&quot; For the love of god, put down the chain heal button and think about what and how you're healing. That's what we got in 3.0, use it now in the raid that Blizzard said would actually be a challenge (and appears to be for a disturbingly large portion of the forums).</div></div><hr />

That's right. I have been playing my Hunter (this toon) since the 21st January, 2006, I can kite any and all classes in game except Rets, and I clearly need to L2P and L2Kite. I also need to L2STACK MOAR REZILIANZ. 969 resilience versus a Ret isn't enough apparently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you are saying that the average Ret unloads 22k damage in 6 seconds against a 864 res target (10% less crit, 23% less crit damage)? Yeah right.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vazor</div><div class="date">2009-05-08, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my full (almost full Ulduar 25 man geared ret paladin in pve gear vs a non-resilience wearer) Ulduar Gear here is a breakdown of my damage:<br />
<br />
1. Judgement to begin with as a distance closer: noncrit 2000 damage; crit 3000 damage<br />
2. Simultaneously melee swing + crusader strike with a seal of martyr attached to both: noncrit 1800 melee + 900 seal; crit melee 2800 + crit (altho seals dont autocrit when melee does, just saying what the crit would be, either/and/or can crit different times) seal 2000; noncrit crusader strike 3000 + noncrit seal 900; crit crusader strike 5000 + crit seal 2000<br />
3. Divine Storm: noncrit divine storm 1800; crit divine storm 3300<br />
<br />
Just examples of how an opener of ALL cooldowns can look on someone with no resilience, with wings up add 20% damage to those average hits/crits I do in duels.<br />
<br />
If you crit on EVERY single of your opening hits (judgement, melee + seal, cs + seal, ds, then another melee + seal) that would be insane proc chance to crit, but meh it would be around 20,000 damage IF EVERYTHING CRIT and it never happens thanks to 60% chance to NOT CRIT people. On people with 800+ resilience I crit 70% less and have around 20% less damage from crits, so that would be like 15,000 damage from an entire crit string and most classes have like 24-28k hp buffed in arena with resilience. RET is broken, we have burst that doesn't work 90% of the time since we have no MS/interrupt/distance closer/slowdowns/long cooldown stun/and broken repentance.<br />
<br />
but exorcism on pets, OP AS HELL!<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, and for stat whores, my pally has self-buffed with just Imp Might/Seal of the Martyr/Ret Aura up:<br />
<br />
4574 Attack Power (I have 1380ish strength unbuffed)<br />
35% baseline crit + 18% for judgements + 3% debuff on target<br />
12% haste + 3% from talents<br />
11% armor pen<br />
20.7k hp</div></div><hr />

My 22.6k health (buffed) becomes 18,080. As for RA, it can alongwith consecration, get a Rogue down to 50% health. This is what people mean when they say:<br />
<br />
Ret itself is the most broken DPS spec ever to have hit the World of Warcraft since the &quot;World of Roguecraft&quot; fan movie three years ago.<br />
<br />
See, a Ret was originally a defensive hybrid. Read the class description. Blizzard took that defensive hybrid and gave it 2x a Rogue's Burst Damage, yet retaining all their former defensive abilities and CD's.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I would like to add a memorable quotation from the US DD forums which, unfortunately, most probably went wasted like most wise things that people write there. I will capitalise for added effect:<br />

See, a Ret was originally a defensive hybrid. Read the class description. Blizzard took that defensive hybrid and gave it 2x a Rogue's Burst Damage, yet retaining all their former defensive abilities and CD's.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hyperbole sure is awesome, huh? Stop sprouting crap, the burst damage has been toned down for retribution as low as it can be without hurting them in PvE. A rogue can still dish out fuckloads of damage in seconds, with having the ever-so-awesome element of surprise, and they have actual escape mechanisms, while ret pally can just bubble. After those 12 seconds, that's it.<br />
<br />
Bad comparison pal.</div></div><hr />

You're bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's right. I have been playing my Hunter (this toon) since the 21st January, 2006,<br />
<br />
So you've been bad for 3 years? Because Hunters who were bad at 60, still bad at 70, and still are bad at 80 don't exist? If anything, there are more bad Hunters then most classes put together.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Further proof that you're bad (and somewhat ignorant).<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not like Hunters have any way of stunning, slowing, gaining distance, or immunity to spells/melee attacks, especially against a spec that has no snare, no gap closer, and that relies on Hand of Freedom for unrestricted movement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I also need to L2STACK MOAR REZILIANZ. 969 resilience versus a Ret isn't enough apparently.<br />
<br />
Spoken like a bad player. May I suggest 'not getting hit' ? Enter &quot;Learn2Kite&quot;.<br />
<br />
I mean...mages can do it...why can't you?<br />
<br />
Bad players will always complain about Ret, no matter what Blizz does.</div></div><hr />

1. No. No class whatsoever can kill a Beast Mastery Tenacity or Cunning pet in 2 GCD's. Only Rets can. Will they still be able to do so after the Exorcism fix? No. It will take them 4 seconds instead of two.<br />

Oh, I see. BG and ganking experience. Good sir, by that coin I could claim rogues OP. I could claim mages OP. I could claim the very BM and Survival hunters OP. I can claim anything OP. Why? Because if I am caught with my pants down, ANYTHING will kill me. If I am in a disadvantage, I will get trashed. If I get the upper hand, I will annihilate. With any char. It is like that with any class. I mean, come on. I have been killed by hunters in few GCDs on my ret paladin. Does this say anything? It doesn't say anything more than your ridiculous whine about ret pallies twoshotting your pets (give me a break).</div></div><hr />

EDIT: I would like to add a memorable quotation from the US DD forums which, unfortunately, most probably went wasted like most wise things that people write there. I will capitalise for added effect:<br />
<br />
WITH RET IN WOTLK, BLIZZARD COMMITTED THE CARDINAL SIN OF MMORGS: THEY BASICALLY PRODUCED A TANK MAGE<br />
<br />
And yet, if you take a look at any arena ladder around, you won't see much retris there. Rogues - sure. Priests - no doubts. Some mages. DK/Shammy. Not so much of the MOST BROKEN DPS.<br />
Originally, ret were *absolutely and completely pvp unplayable*. Blizzard tried to made the good and, well, made them OP. And from now on, the whole damn WOTLK is nerf, after nerf, after nerf, after nerf. Could you guys stop QQ already? <br />
I pretty much see &quot;your healing spells cannot be cast on yourself&quot;, &quot;your hammer of wrath doesn't work on other players&quot; coming....<br />
<br />
TBH, the game where class is changed every other week in Blizzard's hopeless crusade to so called balance is very annoying... I mean, I can accept the class balance at some, stable stage - and, say, level resto druid for arena, as many did for TBC. What is annoying is that every other day you wake up playing something different from what you were playing yesterday. <br />
<br />
Don't know about you, guys, but I enjoyed this game much more in the stable TBC metagame than being a target for GC expiriments in WOTLK laboratory.</div></div><hr />

It's S6 around. Wake up. No more palas and DK dominance. That's rogue and priest now. Change your reason to &quot;ignore arena&quot; (while the real reason is that you just not good enough to compete there - as am I and 99% of people playing the game are).<br />
<br />
If you read, what you quote, you will see that that's not overpowered paladins which drives people out of arena, that's rating reqs which makes absolutely impossible for most people to get any gear from arena. <br />
<br />
And from BG expirience I wouldn't make any judgement. Blizzard are balancing (well, hopelessly trying to balance) the PVP metagame around arena. They don't care about BG much.</div></div><hr />

When pets contribute a large part of what should make Warlocks and Hunters viable--and doesn't--there needn't be new special ways of specifically killing those said pets. The fact that you can CC them is enough.<br />

Don't try to bash GC over this. I think that you won't find many -thinking- members of the community in favour. I have posted many times why I think that GC is doing a good job at the official forums and I am a little tired to repeat that ad nauseam. <br />
<br />
In short terms, the Crab is implementing a new design paradigm. This new design paradigm IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT over the Vanilla design paradigm and the TBC design paradigm. What the Crab needs to do -at present- is hold his horses, a bit. There are problems, sure, but Errae Humanum Est-&#932;&#959; &#963;&#966;&#940;&#955;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#945;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#974;&#960;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957;. Overall, WOTLK is a significantly better experience than both Vanilla and TBC. <br />
<br />
There are PvP balancing issues sure, but let's face it there have always been issues with classes in PvP in the this game. Briefly, in 1.8-1.12 there was the World Of Castercraft, prior 1.8 the World of Roguecraft, then in TBC there were the Cheat Death Rogues and the unkillable Resto Druids, and so on. What's more important, is that Bliz has demonstrated that they have learned from their previous mistakes. GC in particular has proved that he is keen to improve the game and a tad anxious to fix issues in game as soon as possible. Unavoidably, there are bound to be side-effects.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sprtsplyr3189</div><div class="date">2009-05-08, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to play a warrior back in vanilla and in bc so I know a bit about their mechanics. My hunter now has about 870 resilience. I also have a ret pally in some pvp gear so I think my judgement should be rather accurate.<br />
<br />
Hunters are rather gimp right now in arena. They are squishy, even with a healer. they are barely represented in 2s and I dont think anyone can say that they arent gimped atm. Alot of their mechanics are broken.<br />
<br />
However. As a hunter, its damn near im possible to kill a warrior. 3 charges in 24 seconds with bladestorm to stay out of CC (and a rediculous lag range). These charge stuns make it impossible enough as a hunter to win. Hunters disengage is 22 sec max...how does that equal the 3 charge stuns + hamstring from the warrior? Not to mention all the undispellable bleed effects. Not to mention and iceblock and bubble breaker which can only be done by priest.<br />
<br />
Ret pallys are killable on my hunter, even with hand of freedom. If you cant kill a ret pally (that doesnt use LoH) than you got some issues. *Tip* Open up with a a wyvern at range..his judgements have a short range..Serpent sting, black arrow, concussie shot, explosive shot, aimed shot...should take him to about half health by the time he judges u once probably. He will have to bubble and reset in msot cases after a shot or two. The main thing against ret pallys is you have to pay attention to their CD's and time ur deterrence when u know they are about to blow them. You can still stay away from rets just by running, which is the exact opposite of a warrior. Not to mention, good warriors will spell reflect most spells they see coming ( from mages and locks, etc). Followed by a disarm (even ranged from hunters)<br />
<br />
Also, from playing as ret in arena a bit. There are ALOT of things that own ret pallys. Like cyclone, rogue stuns (kidney shot and freedom dont work). The more i PvP the more i realize freedom has ALOT of limitations. While it is crazy that pallys can burst alot in three moves....THATS ALL THEY HAVE...so if you have dmg reduction moves (hunter deterrence,frost armor,shield, power word shield, anti magic bubble, etc) you can probably get the pally pretty far down until his cds are up.<br />
<br />
In short. Warriors need a nerf. Three charges in 24 seconds is rediculous. Bladestorm range is rediculous. Ret pallys just need to be changed...maybe add one more dps move and spread the dps of the moves out more. Hunters need an overall buff imo (and im not saying that bc its my favorite, it just happen to be my main)<br />
<br />
These three classes are just the prime example of what blizz does best. Overbuff underpowered classes, and nerf overpowered classes at the same time so they cant equal out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I agree that:<br />
(1) Discussion with community which GC has is good and he is great at that, thanks to him<br />
(2) *Overall* WOTLK is better expirience than Vanilla and TBC<br />
<br />
However, I don't like this &quot;agile&quot; stile of introducing changes with using the whole community as early adopters/beta testers. <br />
<br />
- Let's try to nerf judgement, but give them exorcism on all targets, guys, and see what happens? <br />
- Sure thing!<br />
- Oops, it seems there are some problems<br />
- Uh, um, well let's make it unworkable on players<br />
- Should we change a spell info? <br />
- No, wait, probably we will change our mind before they even notice<br />
- They noticed and dream this is bag<br />
- Ok, let me go to some US tanking forum and explain our position there and see how it works<br />
- They are unhappy<br />
- Well, before announcing this to the whole community let's say then we are going to rework palas anyway, so for now just wait<br />
<br />
And we are talking about class that was completely reworked in WOTLK *already*. <br />
<br />
The research part of R&amp;D is good, however it usually happens not on the whole customer base as testers. Imaging Microsoft starting to apply hotfix to windows every other day which completely changes the way how the system works. Don't think you would be happy. <br />
<br />
And all in all - look - all classes are unhappy now. There's no one which is happy, as far as i know. As it is &quot;one big buff many small nerfs&quot; game, and the first nerf comes very fast after the buff, so the most of the time it's just nerf-nerf-nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In order for GC and Blizzard to even CONSIDER to make exorcism not work on pets, or to even REALISE that Exorcism was broken, it took:<br />
<br />
1. Perhaps 10 or 20 Hunters and Hunter alts (and God knows how many Warlocks) getting banned at the US and EU forums and the same number of threads getting locked, because they dared to suggest that Ret damage was way beyond OP, and that Ret itself is the most broken DPS spec ever to have hit the World of Warcraft since the &quot;World of Roguecraft&quot; fan movie three years ago.<br />
<br />
2. Still, after all the commotion, they are &quot;considering&quot; it.<br />
<br />
3. What will happen after this change, is basically that Rets will no longer be able to two-shoot (literally) Beast Mastery Cunning and Tenacity pets with 16k hit points. They will just four-shoot them, i.e. instead of spending two seconds to kill a BM tenacity or cunning pet, they will now spend four.<br />
<br />
After the above, and similar incidents in the past, am I unjustified to propose that Blizzard does not play their own game? Am I now?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah... sure... let's try to believe that statement... poor pets... not only they won't die to 2-shot or 4-shot, but also the Ret noob is wasting precious GCDs and CDs on a pet instead of the hunter (while the hunters stay far away kiting, /loling, and killing the Ret noob).<br />
<br />
Guess what? Other classes/spec can just ignore your pet and tear you down without you even noticing (hi mages!). You know why you and other people complain only about Rets? Because you guys weren't used to still didn't get used to have retribution paladins as oponents worth of your atention in pvp. Some people still live in a world where you could just laugh at the Ret trying to tickle them while they just go their business and when they had time, one-shot the RetLOL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Basically, you just proved what I said... you still live in a world where RetLOLs existed.<br />
<br />
Really dude, L2P, you said that Rets can just eat your 22k (only?) HP... If they could do that AND with Seal of Crusader, you could have a point, but they can only get closer to that with:<br />
<br />
A) Better gear then you have;<br />
B) Seal of Martyr/Blood, wich means that they're non-stop &quot;vindicating&quot; themselves for you. Remember, if they just unload that much damage, they would be in a really bad position for a &quot;2-shot&quot;. And I'm talking against someone without a pet... dishing all that damage to themselves for just a pet is giving the hunter a huge advantage.<br />
C) Non-stop CS/Judge/DS/Exo unload on you, wich would mean, they would not have CDs on their skills and you just like to go melee as a ranged class with a lot of tools to keep distance against Ret paladins (old mentality against retlols). We know that with longer CDs on judgement, ds, cs, exo (and even the almighty consecration), that wont happen. Unless you somehow manage to keep stuned for 2 complete rotations of CS/Judge/DS/Cons/Exo + auto attacks (and all that would need to crit a lot).<br />

Common, ret aura is killing you? Consecration is a huge damage on you (and not only a huge mana waste)?!?! Common... Move out of fire...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really dude, L2P, you said that Rets can just eat your 22k (only?) HP... If they could do that AND with Seal of Crusader, you could have a point, but they can only get closer to that with:<br />
<br />
A) Better gear then you have;<br />
B) Seal of Martyr/Blood, wich means that they're non-stop &quot;vindicating&quot; themselves for you. Remember, if they just unload that much damage, they would be in a really bad position for a &quot;2-shot&quot;. And I'm talking against someone without a pet... dishing all that damage to themselves for just a pet is giving the hunter a huge advantage.<br />
C) Non-stop CS/Judge/DS/Exo unload on you, wich would mean, they would not have CDs on their skills and you just like to go melee as a ranged class with a lot of tools to keep distance against Ret paladins (old mentality against retlols). We know that with longer CDs on judgement, ds, cs, exo (and even the almighty consecration), that wont happen. Unless you somehow manage to keep stuned for 2 complete rotations of CS/Judge/DS/Cons/Exo + auto attacks (and all that would need to crit a lot).<br />

Wall of text hits you for some Ret-style-number.<br />
You die.<br />
<br />
Simple as that, could you please tell me what survival abilities do hunters have?<br />
List, plz</div></div><hr />

Seriously, how hard is it to understand, you can smack the debuff on the priest even if he casts mana-burn for example, and then you just skillstorm him down. Pummel on the other hand wouldnt have such and effect. <br />
<br />
Crying and whining in caps wont make it more balanced. So please stop beeing an idiot and actually admit its op and suck it up. Warriors didnt got awesomlly skilled overnight and hunters didnt went back to huntards. It was the changes to the game that caused the effect.</div></div><hr />
