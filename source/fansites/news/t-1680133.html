I can't even process what you said.<br />
<br />
You seriously think two weeks is such a long wait that you have to unsubscribe?<br />
<br />
You do realize that February comes right after January, and March comes right after February, right? You don't actually think there's months in between those, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Going through Mythic and I personally think it's a bit too fast. I was expecting late February would enough time for Highmaul, and then 2-3 months of Blackrock before the next full tier. I'm okay with it though, since that will give a majority (~500 or so guilds have even progressed enough through Mythic Highmaul to even matter) of raiders the chance to work on both at the same time.</div></div><hr />

I completely agree. Only 136 guilds have cleared mythic and about 9500 guilds have cleared heroic with 15000 guilds sitting at 6/7H. There is obviously still a lot of mythic and heroic guilds that haven't finished Highmaul.</div></div><hr />

Well they are being mis treated, it's not their fault they can only run lfr. Imagine the out cry if every other difficulty wasn't released till the end of march. I can imagine the whining would be a million times worse than the lfr players can do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know with Imperator in Highmaul even on LFR including the trash leading up to it it's still a 15-20 minute clear, which is about the same if a bit less than the other two wings.</div></div><hr />

They aren't being mistreated, they should be counted lucky that they get to experience the content, since before Dragon Soul people couldn't do that, and until this tier people had to agonize through a run that lasted way too long to see it. It also gives a bigger benefit to Normal/Heroic/Mythic raiders, who value the content higher in the first place, which is why they do it.<br />
<br />
If a person wants to, they can easily do Normal, as it is just as easily puggable, even for people who run LFR, and will provide even a slight amount of challenge.<br />
<br />
LFR is only a sight seeing tour, to make content that didn't used to be accessible, accessible to many people who don't or can't raid and want to feel a part of the story still.<br />
<br />
Adding in all of LFR first would be pointless and rude to the people who spend their time focusing on the raiding aspect of the game.</div></div><hr />

The pomposity of this statement is utterly amazing. They should &quot;be counted lucky&quot; that they get to experience the content? The your arrogance is astounding.<br />
<br />
You know what the benefit of doing the other difficulties over LFR is? THE GEAR. Did you forget about the gear?<br />
<br />
But I guess we need to coddle people from others who they don't interact with whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Because my precious feelings will be hurt if someone plays an easier difficulty than me with immensely inferior rewards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And a much better way to do it too, since it reduces pressure on raiders, gives more time to experience the first raid, adds a more progressive feel to the content, and helps properly bridge the gap between raids being released without resorting to fillers that mean nothing. (Don't tell me that 6 bosses and then 10 bosses is &quot;nothing&quot;. Just look at Cataclysm.)</div></div><hr />

I solely raided in LFR throughout the entirety of Mists of Pandaria, and even then I would be damned if all of LFR released at the same time as or even before the other difficulties, as it would be a disgrace and incredibly rude to the people who spend time and effort on the content.</div></div><hr />

I know, right? Heaven forfend that someone not have 3 hours a night to devote to a progression guild. Or that some people might only be quasi-serious about group content and just do LFR for shits and giggles. <br />

The gear is the reward.<br />
<br />
Get over yourself.<br />

Its exceptionally arrogant to pretend you deserve to see more content over anybody else because you play a harder difficulty. You get the achievements, the gear, and (often) the mounts/pets that come with harder difficulties.<br />

Are you so insecure in your own identity that you value your self-worth by what other people can do?</div></div><hr />

If you actually think getting 16 bosses within 3 months is lazy, I'm afraid you've never actually played this game and just resort to whining for the hell of it.<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm we had to wait 5-6 months just to get another 7 bosses, and then another 5-6 months to get another 8 bosses which we were stuck with for a year.<br />
<br />
Having 7 bosses and then 10 bosses 3 months later is a dream come true, and they already started working on the tier after that before Warlords even came out, so I expect we'll have the next tier of raiding somewhere in May-June.<br />

<br />
Yes, they do pay the same, you know something else? World of Warcraft is the first and only MMO to make the highest form of content available for everyone to see. In many Pay to Play monthly subscription MMO's a majority of players are stuck with not being able to do a massive amount of the content because they do not have the time or skill to do so.<br />
<br />
Blizzard makes content accessible to all, just at a slightly later time frame, and people have the audacity to complain about it? It's astounding and outright absurd, not to mention pathetic.</div></div><hr />

I'm not holding up Cataclysm as something good in the slightest. I'm comparing it to what World of Warcraft used to be like, and how much better content management has gotten since then.<br />

A &quot;free lunch,&quot; really? Are you getting the game for free?<br />

Is the better gear not good enough? Is the better fake epeen points not good enough? Because that's really all you want here. To stroke your epeen while telling the LFR plebeians that they're just lucky they get to see it.<br />

And since you seem to think what content you've raided before or are raiding now has any relevancy on your argument, I'm running Heroic as we speak. That doesn't change my opinion whatsoever. I don't care if somebody in LFR kills Blackhand before I do on other difficulties.<br />
<br />
Why? Because I'm not a child. I know I'll get the better gear. I know I'll get greater satisfaction from a harder difficulty kill. And I know, if I ever was inclined to do so, I'll have the proof to show that I actually worked hard to get it.<br />

People need to not think about something that was announced before the expansion comes out to be something that needs to be in launch.

One or two weeks until the first tier of LFR sure makes a majority of casual LFR raiders feel the need to get into a proper raiding guild, that's for sure.

No, its not that. They know the largest amount of players raid LFR. If you make it take until the end of March before you can even do the entire thing, then you keep them subscribed at least a month more.<br />

lfr raiders should be happy they are treated as second hand players? Imagine in any other game you pay a monthly subscription to you can't access the difficulty you want to play on until 2months after the game releases?

You sir need to remove the self-righteous finger out of your unmentionables. It wasn't even until an expansion and a bit ago, that people that need LFR, would even get to see the content. The raiding factor allows progression raiders to possibly see the lore behind the fights before people that sight see their way through it in LFR. Yes it does award more gear, but in LFR you are paying attention to about 5% of the mechanics if that compared to Heroic, let alone Mythic.</div></div><hr />

LFR is not raiding... at all. LFR is a preview of the current raid content. It is a bonus to those players who are interested in seeing what the current raid is about. They have added Normal, heroic and mythic so you can choose which level is right for you. If you are only doing LFR you are not raiding, you are collecting.</div></div><hr />

Insulting people is not a good way to bring your point across. Letting people kill Blackhand in LFR before normal/H/Mythic certainly devalue the raid as whole. You may not think so but a lot of people think like that including me and not because we are children.</div></div><hr />

them wanting the bosses killed on harder difficulties first is part of it but the main thing is they don't want LFR players to run through the whole instance in a week or two and then either unsub or complain that they have nothing to do. just because you don't like to raid harder difficulties that take more time to progress through doesn't mean you can complain that there is nothing to do but that doesn't stop people so instead blizzard staggers the wings so lfr raiders have something new to do for at least 6 weeks.</div></div><hr />

But, so what? People who do not raid or only run LFR out number those who run mythic by at least ten times. Why should the majority, who pay for the content to be created, care that a boss, which they probably have little to no interest in, is devalued for a small minority?

you need to remember that raid content wasn't made for you, the majority. raids were around long before lfr and were only made for and experienced by a small amount of people. just cause they opened up a lower difficulty for the majority doesn't mean that's who the content is meant for. and the reason why they don't want blackhand killed in LFR first is because of the reason you just said....you don't care and have little to no interest in it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raiding is all about progression in both story and content. Luckily LFR is made possible to view the story, but there's absolutely no progression in terms of content. You say that Blizzard should focus on the ones who only go for LFR to see the story and not the content are more valuable than the minority that spend time and effort to see both.<br />
<br />
Blizzard disagrees, as raiding has always been for the ones who put the time and effort into the content, they just decided to make a theater version for story available for everyone else.<br />
<br />
They have the option to see that story or not, Blizzard is not forcing them to. Others on the other hand spend time and effort on it, and even though they are the vast minority, Blizzard focuses on them far more than the majority that just blaze through it, see the story, and are done.</div></div><hr />

Since LFR is so easy it's best to give at least a weeks head start for the more hardcore raiders to get the chance to progress at least past the point where the first wing of LFR goes to, or else LFR people will see it within an hour of servers opening, when many guilds may not see it for days after that.</div></div><hr />

LFR didn't come out until 4.3, and they stated with the release of wrath that they were tired of only 1% of players seeing raids they make. That was why they made Naxx the first raid of Wrath, remember? Almost nobody saw it in Vanilla.</div></div><hr />

The Straw Man fallacy is committed when a person simply ignores a person's actual position and substitutes a distorted, exaggerated or misrepresented version of that position. This sort of &quot;reasoning&quot; has the following pattern: Person A has position X.<br />

<br />
Raids have been in the game since pretty much the beginning, however the so-called casual content has been squeezed over successive expansions in a futile effort to push the majority into raiding. When raiding makes up the majority of max level content, as it does now, those who have nothing to do but wait whilst Blizzard milk their subscription until they see fit to let them have 20 mins of new content every week or two, have every right to complain.<br />
<br />
This is nothing more than poor attempt to string, all of us, along for as long as possible with a minimal amount of content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it would be a lot easier on people's minds if they just removed gear from LFR and kept it solely as a story mode.</div></div><hr />

You apparently think you are the only one being responded to on this thread. Or that when I talk about &quot;people,&quot; I'm talking about you. You really do need to work on that arrogance problem of yours.<br />
<br />
Oh--and to head off the &quot;LFR babies&quot; thing, let me redirect them to this:<br />
<br />
<br />
And since you seem to think what content you've raided before or are raiding now has any relevancy on your argument, I'm running Heroic as we speak. That doesn't change my opinion whatsoever. I don't care if somebody in LFR kills Blackhand before I do on other difficulties</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? I would think it would be actually arrogant if I was saying I should be able to get Mythic gear from LFR.<br />
<br />
I don't think you really understand what the word &quot;cheating&quot; means because it inherently means using underhanded techniques to get something everyone else has. LFR is a feature of the game. Get over it. If you don't play it, that's fine. But you're the arrogant one if you think that you should be able to tell anybody else what and when they can see things because they don't play at your exact level.<br />
<br />
You are being rewarded 650 gear for basically doing nothing, when there is 640 gear that demands several days of dailies as well as absurd amount of gold to purchase. You are NOT entitled to that gear, and you are NOT entitled to see the content prior to people that put in more effort into doing so. That is the point of a progression game, you are suppose to be rewarded for putting in the hours. And don't say &quot;your reward is gear&quot;, that is bollocks that applies to people which do not care for lore. I, and certainly several others, liked the fact that the real ending of Highmaul was only available in Mythic. That was a well deserved reward for those that tried really hard to get it, ontop of the gear. Not everything is loot you know.<br />
A second point which I doubt you considered, just as well as LFR players shouldn't be forced into normals or heroics to see their precious content should normal or heroic raiders feel like they have to do LFR to progress in their own. The loot is to easily aquired and there are certainly many people out there right now that won't have 650+ in all item slots before the release of Blackrock Foundry. Blizzard has stated in multiple occassions (i'm not gonna reffer to it, if you missed it you are blind) that they don't want proper raiders to feel as if they are forced into doing LFR for the sake of their own progression, and this is how they decided to deal with it. The LFR players which don't have the time for proper raiding (I don't get why you pay for an MMO if you don't have time for it) still get to see their content and get their gear, just at a slower pace and lower level. Just like it should be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With that argument neither does the last boss, because you're just going to kill him and be done with it. They could name the boss something entirely different, like &quot;Blackfist&quot; and it would still be the same to many people.<br />
<br />
People who actually care about the lore and the content realize that there's lore and story attached to every boss, not just the last, and that they all matter, not just the last. There always has to be an end, and generally the most important is the end, that doesn't make the rest unimportant though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chances are most raiding guild will not have killed blackhand on mythic by the 24th. Normal and Heroic are irrelevant kills. Just gear on the loot path.</div></div><hr />

And if mythic raiders paid more then you'd have an actual argument.<br />
<br />
If Mythic raiders paid more then they would be the only ones allowed in Mythic, this is not the case. Everyone is allowed in Mythic, they just have to put time, effort, and skill into it. Things they are unwilling to do.<br />
<br />
It is for the sole reason that people pay the same amount that the best of raiders can do the hardest of content that others can't do.</div></div><hr />

that still doesn't mean the content was designed for the majority. when they make a raid they don't make lfr first and then create normal, heroic and mythic from that. they start with the higher difficulties then water it down for lfr.</div></div><hr />

then why are you running lfr to begin with? the mechanics are just reused and its boring cause you've done it for years. honestly you just said that there is no content outside of raids and you don't want to raid....that to me sounds like you don't really wanna play the game anymore.</div></div><hr />

It's a novel concept that people are allowed to not play games they don't enjoy. They can go outside and do something, god forbid. Or just play another game.<br />

It is getting harder and harder to take you seriously. WOD was released off of the back of 14 months without any form of new content and it contains the least amount of zones of any previous expansion, the least amount of dungeons, the least amount of new battle grounds, arenas, max level questing, raids and even new-ish features such as scenarios have fallen by the way side in favour of, well... nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus does it really matter? It's not like the gear you get from any raid level has any real use outside of that or higher difficulty raids since Blizzard has seen fit to provide us with bupkiss to do in the actual game world so I'm not losing anything by having it staggered other than a reason to spend time playing the game each week. I appreciate Blizzard's concern in helping us find the time to add more variety to our gaming diets by giving the bulk of the players the least possible to actually do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The zones are the biggest zones of any expansion, holding more content than any expansion.<br />
<br />
WoD has quite easily more content than any other expansion before it. Races aren't actually content, it's just an aesthetic that people soon get bored of. Classes are new content but just end up bloating and breaking the game temporarily.<br />
<br />
Each dungeon is built better than any other dungeon before it. BC had loads of them, but they were all terrible made and used similar layouts and designs, with boring tunnels and rubble everywhere. Some of the least aesthetically pleasing content in the game.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds generally come out mid expansion, not at the beginning of an expansion.<br />
<br />
There's more max level questing than ever before, especially with the garrison campaign missions, something entirely new to WoD.<br />
<br />
There's 7 and then 10 new bosses within 3-4 months of the release of the game, something that's definitely impressive and on par with other expansions.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of new features, I'm sorry you feel the need to not do them or bash them though and not call them features, but your opinion doesn't change the fact.</div></div><hr />

Many of this crying over not getting the content as fast shows a startling realization that they are unaware of how this is how things have always been done and always will be done, and entitlement doesn't solve anything except making the entitled person complain more and more when they don't get it and they don't get it now.</div></div><hr />

Currently LFR offers at the very most two hours worth of content assuming that there will be a similar amount of content in the next raid we are looking at four to five hours max level content over the course of four months. So, yes, if I am getting four to five hours worth of content I would prefer to run it all in the first month and be done until 6.2 instead of paying four months worth of sub fees.

lets see WoD has 6 zones + ashran, MoP had 6 zones. WoD has 7 new dungeons and 1 remake, MoP had 6 and 3 remakes. i'm not sure about BGs cause I don't PVP. Max level questing...WoD has garrison campaigns, invasions and a small amount of dailies, MoP had TONS of dailies that people complained about. Scenerios were used as solo quest progression instead of 3 person dungeons...that's about the only thing WoD is missing but scenarios were useless fairly quick anyway since the gear wasn't great.</div></div><hr />

I love the argument &quot;they should just release more content&quot;. Do you have even the slightest fragment of an idea how much time and effort it takes to program something like this? Just look at an indie dev group, it can take them months or years to program something as simple as the average indie game you see on Steam, yet you just tell a AAA MMO that uses loads of resources and time, with many of the devs staying late hours, to just &quot;make more content&quot;?<br />

That's high arrogance. If you feel there isn't enough content being produced fast enough, feel free to find a game that does, and if they perchance do then good on them and feel free to play it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's actually some of the fastest that content has been released in the history of raiding. I was expecting Blackrock to not come out until late Feb early March. A vast majority of guilds haven't even finished Highmaul on Heroic yet, let alone started Mythic.</div></div><hr />

they have been promising faster xpacs and no more year long waits. there's a big difference. they never once said they would be pushing raids out faster. that wouldn't make any sense when they've said that in the beginning of MoP they released the raids too fast.</div></div><hr />

Except they're even slower than Pandaria. 5.1 was released two months after MoP launched. We're not likely to see 6.1 until nearly four months after WoD launched. And so far it doesn't appear to have as much content as 5.1 did. Maybe they have something amazing hidden away that they haven't revealed yet, but so far it's not much more than a bunch of system updates and twitter integration.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pann</div><div class="date">2015-01-14, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The zones are the biggest zones of any expansion, holding more content than any expansion.<br />
<br />
WoD has quite easily more content than any other expansion before it. Races aren't actually content, it's just an aesthetic that people soon get bored of. Classes are new content but just end up bloating and breaking the game temporarily.<br />
<br />
Each dungeon is built better than any other dungeon before it. BC had loads of them, but they were all terrible made and used similar layouts and designs, with boring tunnels and rubble everywhere. Some of the least aesthetically pleasing content in the game.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds generally come out mid expansion, not at the beginning of an expansion.<br />
<br />
There's more max level questing than ever before, especially with the garrison campaign missions, something entirely new to WoD.<br />
<br />
There's 7 and then 10 new bosses within 3-4 months of the release of the game, something that's definitely impressive and on par with other expansions.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of new features, I'm sorry you feel the need to not do them or bash them though and not call them features, but your opinion doesn't change the fact.<br />
<br />
No they are not.<br />
<br />
No it does not.<br />
<br />
I would disagree with that. But still does not change the fact that there are less dungeons.<br />
<br />
Not true at all. Eye of the Storm launched with TBC, SOTA shipped with Wrath, Twin Peaks and Battle for Gilneas were both available from the beginning of Cata and MOP had Silvershard Mines and ToK.<br />
<br />
There isn't. Garrisons offer one daily plus a weekly quest.<br />
<br />
There is, at present, one raid with seven bosses. Oh and two world bosses with tiny loot tables.</div></div><hr />

Imagine the out cry if every other difficulty wasn't released till the end of march. I can imagine the whining would be a million times worse than the lfr players can do.<br />
<br />
When you look at the statistics that MMOCHAMP posts from time to time you would realize that the MAJORITY of the player base are NOT regular raiders and rely on LFR for their raid experience.<br />
<br />
IMO this schedule is a joke. I was keeping subbed to see the next raid. I can unsub for a month or two and come back when it is all open. It will likely be the joke the Highmaul LFR is too which means you don't need good dps/gear to actually do it.<br />
<br />
I'd love to do some regular raiding but my work schedule means I can only do it on the weekends and weekends family comes first so...and I can't be assed doing pugs cause of the fail they usually encounter. So for me to see the story and get my ring finished I need LFR...but waiting till the end of March....<br />
<br />
I was thinking last night how bored I am with WoW. Farming old raids is pretty much the only thing I do when I log in...*yawn* I've done all the quests in WoD and got all the treasures and maxed all my professions...not much else to do but farm rep and man that is more boring than doing old raids. Yeah I guess I'm canceling till March.</div></div><hr />

Have you tried.... not doing all the content in 16 hour days until it's done? That might help.<br />
<br />
Also, garrison missions will be continued to be released in batches every patch. More are coming in 6.1 next month.</div></div><hr />

You can have all the money in the world, and still have trouble building a game any faster. Money doesn't increase game development, at times it can even decrease it (hiring more people decreases the time it takes to make content, this has been proven through study, up to a certain amount), dev skill does, and dev skill can only go so far. It's even harder when senior level devs retire.<br />
<br />
Money doesn't make the world go round, despite popular theory, it's skill and intelligence that does. A basic economics course teaches this.</div></div><hr />

It's hard to understand that the content comes out in the 3rd for people that care to do it. Just because you don't want to do normal/heroic doesn't mean it isn't there for you to do. So yes, his math is correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really enjoyed the LFR in Panda. It was moderately challenging and interesting and very commonly groups would wipe and fall apart. Other times they rose to the occasion and did well. <br />
<br />
But, with WoD, Blizzard listened to the hardcore raid crowd who always hated LFR for some reason, and turned LFR into a totally neutered faceroll that's no fun or challenge at all. They are intent on pushing the message that you are a 2nd Class WoW player unless you do organized raiding. <br />
<br />
This is the primary reason I'm leaving WoW when my sub runs out in 2 days. I can write stuff like Garrisons off as a good try that wasn't well thought out. But the deliberate turning of LFR into complete garbage is what is driving me away. <br />
<br />
I'm sure people will respond with &quot;LFR was always faceroll&quot; or &quot;LFR is just Tourist Mode&quot;. That's because, if you choose to raid Heroic or above then LFR IS NOT DESIGNED FOR YOU. But it used to serve the desires of a lot of players very well. Now, it's been made miserable for everybody.</div></div><hr />

Highmaul's was 5 weeks. Blackrock's will be 7 weeks, just an extra two weeks from Highmauls. It will also have 3 more bosses. There really is very little difference between the two. Is it just because you decided to complain now?<br />

An easier difficulty has everything to do with the availability. You are just deliberately ignoring what he meant in order to pretend to have a point. You didn't like being called childish earlier, but you have been acting like a child throughout this thread.<br />
<br />
For years before LFR the raid release was when the content was released. That should NOT change just because an easier theater mode of it was introduced.</div></div><hr />

You can kill every boss in the raiding tier from the 3rd. So how does that make it not fully available? <br />
<br />
Blackhand is the end boss of this raiding tier and he is available to everybody on February 3rd. It so happens to be that its only Normal and Heroic difficulty, however this still makes it fully available for everybody to kill.</div></div><hr />

WoD has 7 new dungeons and 1 remake, MoP had 6 and 3 remakes. i'm not sure about BGs cause I don't PVP. Max level questing...WoD has garrison campaigns, invasions and a small amount of dailies, MoP had TONS of dailies that people complained about. Scenerios were used as solo quest progression instead of 3 person dungeons...that's about the only thing WoD is missing but scenarios were useless fairly quick anyway since the gear wasn't great.<br />
<br />
Yes, WOD has six zones but unlike previous expansions one of those six zones contains little more than a couple of dailies for the opposite faction. So in reality it may as well just be five zones. Seriously Ashran cannot be counted as a zone. Oh, and MOP had seven zones.<br />
<br />
So WOD 8 dungeons and MOP 9. You know that 8 is less than 9? Right?<br />
<br />
Garrison campaigns are weekly quests that take between 10 and 20 minutes to complete. Invasions again weekly, as long as you face the drudgery of the daily Apexis quest, that is ten minutes of content. There is not just a small amount of dailies there are pet battles, fishing and the Apexis and not much else.<br />
<br />
Players complained about the gating behind dailies not the actual dailies in MoP.</div></div><hr />

LFR does not change anything, as Blizzard devotes an incredibly small amount of time to it. Next to nothing compared to the other difficulties. The reason it was added in so late was it was an afterthought to give casual players a way to experience the end game content without having to struggle.<br />

None of the difficulties outside of Mythic require much thought so I'm not sure what your argument even means. They test it on the PTR/beta just like other difficulties. And calling it an afterthought requires a great deal more insight into Blizzard's development process than I bet you actually have.<br />

Feel free to ask the Blizzard devs, they'll probably be happy to answer and tell you the same thing I just said. They've stated many times that their target audience has and always will be the more hardcore raiders from Normal to Mythic, but Mythic takes the top priority always. LFR is just reducing the numbers multiple times over until barely anyone can die, and that's it.</div></div><hr />

No thats what you want the answer to be. The majority of players does indeed choose to raid on LFR difficulty. That is fine, I dont mind what everybody does. This however does not mean they can't do Normal, Heroic or even Mythic. The boss is there for you to kill it, so it is available to you.<br />
<br />
That you dont have the time to spend hours of time to kill it on Normal or higher has nothing to do with availability.</div></div><hr />

And I responded that despite the majority of players using LFR to raid, and LFR coming out later, Blizzard does not care about that, as their target audience for raids is the minority who do Normal-Mythic. Which means that LFR does not matter in when the raid is fully out, as it's an afterthought that Blizzard added to let people experience it. The full raid comes out on the 3rd, and whatever you say will not change that fact.</div></div><hr />

Again, the very existence of LFR proves that they do want the majority to be able to raid, even if it's on snoozefest difficulty. And Mythic may take the top priority, but that doesn't mean LFR is somehow not meant to appeal to the majority.</div></div><hr />

If they never added in LFR to the first place, I can guarantee not a single one of you would be complaining about it right now.<br />
<br />
Now that you actually get content to experience is when you feel the need to complain that it doesn't come fast enough. Ridiculous.<br />
<br />
LFR is made to appeal to the majority, because the majority don't raid on higher difficulties. That does not mean that Blizzard takes it into account for the release cycle of the raids. They prioritize people's experience in Normal-Mythic higher, so they stagger LFR so people in Normal-Mythic can attempt to complete it before it's out on LFR.<br />

So by &quot;...LFR coming out later...&quot; we are agreed that it will not be fully available to all players on the 3rd. Your assertions about the value Blizzard place on other players is of no value to this topic.<br />
<br />
The raid is available on the 3rd, but I notice that your are ignoring mythic not being available until 10th February, however no amount of linguistic gymnastics, which you really aren't very good at, or outright lying will change the fact that the raid will not be fully available until every wing, including LFR, is released.</div></div><hr />

Incorrect, the raid is fully available when normal comes out. As in, every boss is killable. Mythic and LFR have nothing to do with this fact, as they are just other difficulties.<br />

Yes they did, and they decided to wait to release it to not overwhelm players and to give a better feeling for progression. It's an incredibly smart move, a good business strategy, and something many people are happy they did.

Here's an idea for the LFR crybabies: Can't stomach waiting a few weeks for LFR? Make a group up and go into Normal mode. It's pretty similar to LFR, you just need to learn how to communicate with other human beings a little and be prepared to endure the psychological horror of watching your precious character die a couple of times. <br />
<br />
Here's the thing. If you are completely unprepared or unwilling to try normal mode like the rest of us, then that's completely on you, not Blizzard. Please dont come on here and litter the forums with your ridiculous sobbing that you have to wait a few weeks to snooze your way through tourist mode because you're simply (let's be honest here) too lazy to get gear the real way, k?</div></div><hr />

But it doesn't mean that they're releasing content faster when they had to delay the expansion to complete the designing and testing of BRF.

Just because you don't want to do the content doesn't make it all of a sudden disappear and make you right.<br />

Really the raid is not fully available when normal comes out, Blizzard have even provided a schedule which is helpfully posted in the first post as to when it will be fully available.<br />

I don't assume anything of anyone, I just go along with their side of the argument and counter it. Just because you decided I was talking about you in particular means little.

You literally said exactly what I responded to, in the fullest sense of the word. &quot;Majority of players&quot; I responded that the majority in this case doesn't matter as much.

The raid is fully available when normal comes out, as has been said time and time again. Just because you think killing the last boss on Normal doesn't mean it's fully out means nothing. Facts are facts.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't rely on you being an LFR raider, it relies on you adhering to your chosen argument.<br />
<br />
Also, generally in a debate, &quot;arrogant&quot; isn't thrown around like a toy.<br />
<br />
I haven't looked down on anyone. Believing that LFR should be released after isn't looking down on the people who do LFR, and I'm sorry you think so. Not once in my entire time in this thread have I looked down on a single person, and I've been the person that only does LFR for a long time.<br />
<br />
It's sad you think I'm looking down on people though. It may be because you think it strengthens your argument, or some other obscure reason, but I hold others in just as high if not a higher regard than myself, even people on the internet.<br />
<br />
I like to think people are people, and they're worth just as much as everyone else, no matter what they choose to think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a person who do more than LFR, I honestly don't care if Blizz gave LFR players more love. I mean they even stopped handing out Tier sets now. The sole reason why LFR is more gated than regular raids is because Blizz wants people spend more time on their game, not because they wanna show respects to regular raiders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I've raided in the past, I'm only doing LFR currently for various reasons and I pay $15 per month to get content that I want. Aside from the raid and dungeons I'm not that interested in the content they're talking about and for whatever reasons they've decided that the raid content will not be fully available to me until March. So...<br />
<br />
...I won't be paying them until March. <br />
<br />
Sometime in that month, I'll get another time card and run BRF. This is one advantage of the monthly time cards - every month I have a quick &quot;am I still having enough fun to spend $15 again?&quot; check. If so, i buy a timecard online. <br />
<br />
It doesn't matter to me WHY they're doing this - it's a pure product decision. The product I'd get in February isn't worth $15 to me so I'll save my money and spend time elsewhere. When they've made the product better for me, I'll buy another month. I know... shocking isn't it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This argument of yours:<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that you actually get content to experience is when you feel the need to complain that it doesn't come fast enough. Ridiculous.<br />
<br />
That relies entirely upon me being an LFR raider. The only reason I'm even arguing against you is because I don't think that the raid will be fully available until March 24th, which in my opinion is a bit too long for no good reason. <br />
<br />
Why does the first wing have to wait two weeks after normal/heroic become available? They've never done that before, the first wing has always unlocked one week after normal/heroic. And this extra two week wait for the final boss is just ridiculous as well.<br />
<br />
And why is wanting the content to not take a month and a half to finally be fully available so &quot;ridiculous&quot;? Why can't it just be a week between wings like they've done before? And having a final wing with just one boss makes the extra week feel even more arbitrary. ToT had four wings with 12 bosses and SoO had 4 wings with 14 bosses. BRF is unnecessarily stretched out across 4 wings with just 10 bosses. And neither of those had to wait an extra week between wing 3 and 4 coming out. And yes, people complained about a lack of content between SoO and WoD, but that was more on Blizzard for taking so long to finally release WoD than about delaying SoO LFR by any amount of time.<br />
<br />
So it's a combination of things that are irritating about BRF's release schedule that point to larger problems with Blizzard. They're doing more gating with less content than before, despite their promises about more content being produced faster. Unless 6.1 has a huge amount of content hidden away, it's going to have less than 5.1 while taking about twice as long to come out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ERm, not only. Actual gameplay is also a benefit. Having to apply both teamwork, coordination and individual skill.<br />
<br />
You might get to see the fights and the raid, but you don't really experience them in LFR.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not really the point though. I do agree they might have gone a bit too far with how much it takes for last boss to come out, but considering how easy LFR is at the moment, I don't see how it goes as far as &quot;harming&quot; LFR raiders. You can just not re-sub until the last boss releases in LFR if that's all you want to do.</div></div><hr />

LFR is not raiding, it is a chance for people to experience end game content if they can't do the harder difficulties or they don't have the time for it( which isn't an excuse IMO because you can just go find a group doing Individual bosses and spread it out over the week).<br />
<br />
Did you ever think that they did this because they don't want people who actually spend the time to progress and raid to just lol through LFR and learn all the fights before progressing. Or letting them get welfare gear to make it easier. If you are that upset about having to wait 2 weeks to raid why don't you suck it up and go find a pug for normal. I am not in my guilds main raiding group and I still managed to do pugs and get 6/7H so you have no excuse for bitching except that you are bad and don't want to take the time to get better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so lets break this down, you're currently not paying them, until march meaning you have no &quot;content&quot; now.<br />
<br />
so if they release it in feb you &quot;complete&quot; LFR you're done you don't buy any more time.<br />
<br />
they release it in march you &quot;complete&quot; LFR you're done and don't buy any more time.<br />
<br />
seems like whenever they release it you just buy 1 month or 2 months of game time, makes no difference to them when you pay.</div></div><hr />

When they first made LFR. They said it was because so few of their player base never saw the work that went into raid. At the time (still true now) so very few people did raids that it was becoming pointless to even make them. LFR saved raids because it gave them a reason to make them again since million will see it. Not a select few thousand. If it wasn't for LFR you would never get raids the size they are. You would be lucky to see 7/8 bosses a teir. <br />

Raid Finder players will jump into normal(no matter if it is too hard for them or not) and will likely be equipped(just need to find a raid that will pull you through for 1 or 2 bosses. Then you have the achievement and will be invited into the next ones and so on) before the Raid Finder gets unlocked. If normal Blackrock Foundry is tuned like Highmaul then this will cause a lot of frustration cause normal Highmaul is much harder than Flex SoO. <br />
<br />
Some in here complain that Raid Finder is basicly faceroll...but seriously: Who cares? It's anyway just there to see the bosses(and cutscenes) before trying normal. The dudes that do Raid Finder only are the same guys that did Icecrown etc. simply an expansion or 3 tiers later. They can wait...they did that before...but WHY should they have to wait 7(!!!) weeks? I see no reason for that.<br />

I definitely will miss Raid Finder cause I just don't want to prepare for normal mode by watching stupid videos. It just ain't the same...</div></div><hr />

Long past time for some new ideas in the MMO genre.<br />
<br />
It's what they like to do, and has always been the core of endgame since day 1 as far as content development goes (not saying it's the core of endgame for every player, I know it isn't). Personally Raiding it's what I like about WoW, if I wanted just roleplay or questing I'd probably be playing other games.<br />
<br />
While we agree it's about time for some new ideas to get in the MMO genre, it wouldn't be very clever of them to suddenly re-formulate a game that has been working just fine for 10 years now. Maybe when they decide to go forward with a new MMO (warcraft or not), but I doubt we'll ever see any big changes in WoW.<br />

You are absolutely right, and I for one defend it's ok for people who do not dedicate much time to the game still being able to see the raids.<br />

With that said, while the timelock for the last boss is a bit overextended, I don't think it's reason for so much complaints, especially now that you can easily PuG normal even 1 boss at a time.</div></div><hr />

The LFR dates seem ok to me. I think the soft gating encourages players (of all levels of experience) to venture forth into Normals -Blizzard's intention, I am sure -which I think we can all agree is a good thing for those that do. Otherwise, if people are not interested in pursuing Normal then the LFR gating is weekly which spans the content over a short period... so not too long to wait.<br />

This one line I have to say you are absolutely 100% correct. But only because I would have quit the game back in Cata like I was planning to before LFR was released. It gave me something to stay occupied with after I left behind the more normal forms of raiding. If it did not exist now I just would not play at all so of course I would not complain about the silly-ass snowflake-pleasing release dates ;)</div></div><hr />

Just release it all at the same time. I pug everything since I am in a family guild. At times I will sub for guilds join their weekly raids. But through pugging I came back at the end of Mist I barely finished the cloak in time. I took time off after clearing WotLK. My favorite genre of gaming is MMO's. I have played a ton of them and beta tested them. But, with what I see with the WoW community is a depressing fog of can't do attitude elitism.<br />
<br />
Add-ons caused way to much drama and Blizzard suck them on up and allowed the nonsense to continue. Add-ons for PvPers or Raiders telling them everything about the player or mobs they are going against. Most of the raiders in WoW even those who have cleared Mythic would not even come close to completing some of the simplest of raids in Everquest. There really was no voice chat because of our terrible computers back in the day. Top guilds would work on strategies that were not beta before hand. We meet with world first guilds in IRC.There was no Youtube, Gear Scores, DBM, and so on. I had no UI's for years or add on's telling me prepare 10 secs for a specific mechanic. <br />
<br />
People do not want to learn encounters. They want to be shown and act as if they are better then someone. I know the wasted hours on learning encounters I agree it was painfully long nights. Most of us are to old to do it anymore but hey no big deal. My issue is before you rag on someone wanting the LFR released. How about you actually learn the mechanics on your own with out the add-ons and gearscore requirements. HM was not even two weeks in and I was seeing raids wanting 640+ for normal. If you run one of those raids you are a fail player and have accomplished nothing but repeating someone's strategy while being trained by DBM on when to react. Anywho, flame on.</div></div><hr />

So those that do ONLY lfr will have had a 9 week spread to the next raid begins releasing.. Doesn't sound too slow at all imo.</div></div><hr />

That's excatly how it is with me too. I did not check the first 2 raids of Cata untill Pandaria. LFR was what got me back into raiding again. SoO was perfect for me(a casual)...you had LFR to test the encounters, Flex was a bit challenging and normal was fine once you had decent equipment level...and heroic was for those that really needed a challenge.<br />
If the tuning stays like it is in Highmaul then LFR comes too late for testing...flex does not exist...therfor you have another difficulty between the old normal and the old heroic, called &quot;new heroic&quot;. Not sure if that will really encourage casuals to do normal raiding.</div></div><hr />
