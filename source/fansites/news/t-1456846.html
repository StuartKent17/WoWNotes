The Scroll of Resurrection Retires<br />
The time has come to bid adieu to the Scroll of Resurrection. It’s served its divine purpose, but like most scrolls, it only has so many charges before it loses its magic and crumbles into ethereal dust. For those who’d still like a chance to use the scroll, you have until February 18 before players are no longer able to send invitations. For those who have an invitation outstanding, that’s still good for 30 days from the time it was sent, after which point the invitation will expire and the benefits can no longer be claimed.<br />
<br />
For additional information on the Scroll of Resurrection, please visit our FAQ. (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/scroll-of-resurrection-faq)<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle.Net Launcher Update<br />
The Battle.Net Launcher was recently updated to add support for Warlords of Draenor.<br />

I don't think they will bring it back. given that with WOD you get a free 90 then that would make the scroll give an 80 or a 2nd 90. That would possibly cut into people buying 90's when that goes live.</div></div><hr />

First of all, we haven't seen any models for the gear you'll get and you're jumping to conclusions on what it'll look like, and second of all if they DID use those models it would basically force anyone who wanted those models for transmog to buy a 90 even if they didn't want one...</div></div><hr />

Possibly the day of, possibly a week or so after. Depends when they start preorders/prepurchases. <br />
<br />
It will be in the files and ready for use. It's just a matter of when they flip the switch. Nobody knows when that might be yet.</div></div><hr />

You can still do that, as can hunters with eagle eye. It just requires the right macro string. /cast !Farsight</div></div><hr />

There's a limit to it. You can't go beyond certain point. I used to be able to go from Borean Tundra to Howling Fjord. Not anymore. I will try with &quot;!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Update. Doesn't work. 1000y range. Not unlimited like it used to be. Gotta wait for PTR to come live to get what we once had.<br />

<br />
I believe this is the stuff: http://ptr.wowhead.com/items?filter=qu=2;minle=483;maxle=483<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I did the filters right, but I think this covers it. &quot;Springrain&quot; is one boosted 90 set. &quot;Felsoul&quot; is another. You'd have to connect your own dots.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned in an earlier post that you get the 483 greens on the boosted 90, and you'll automatically get the quest to go out to Timeless, so you can certainly run out there and grab the free purps for the instant upgrade and go from there.</div></div><hr />

What does it have to do with capital letters?<br />
<br />
The typo is that &quot;an&quot; should be &quot;a&quot; because &quot;Dread Raven&quot; doesn't start with a vowel.</div></div><hr />

I believe because it's the name of something. You don't use &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot; (where appropriate) with names. &quot;A Derek Jeter announced his retirement today&quot; doesn't make sense grammatically, its just &quot;Derek Jeter announced his retirement today&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Because it is a name in this case. You don't do &quot;a Kathranis&quot; etc.</div></div><hr />

But the Dread Raven as mentioned here is an object as well as a regular noun. A similar sentence would be &quot;I am eating a pear.&quot; Whereas it makes sense to not use a/an for a proper noun, a regular noun would need that. Kathranis and Nexsa are both correct, it should be &quot;Summons and dismisses a Dread Raven.&quot;</div></div><hr />
