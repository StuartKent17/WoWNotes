Gnome and Tauren Mount Size Update<br />
With today’s PTR update, you might notice mount size changes for gnome and tauren player characters. For a very long time, we’ve had issues that stem from gnomes and tauren riding on mounts that appear larger than intended. We’re adjusting their sizing down on normal* mounts.<br />
This allows us to correct many art and animation bugs with these specific races when mounted, and they look better. Gnomes and tauren now look more like they should, gnomes can actually reach their reins, and tauren can fit through more doorways when mounted.<br />
<br />
Here’s an example of how a gnome character looks when mounted-<br />
<br />
Before the change-<br />

<br />
And after the change-<br />

<br />
This new tech also means that it’s now possible for us to address issues where some mounts are too small on some races. We’re looking to find examples along those lines, so please keep your feedback coming.<br />
Thank you!<br />
*There are a few mounts that are not considered &quot;normal&quot;-sized to begin with. For example, Hyena mounts are considered &quot;small&quot;, and we’re not sizing tauren differently on small mounts at this time.</div></div><hr />

What exactly is being removed, slugger? Nothing... Nothing is being &quot;removed&quot; nothing is being &quot;cut&quot; nothing is being &quot;Taken Away&quot;. Some people, I swear, just want to make mountains out of every little molehill.<br />

Is it silly? Yeah, its a silly change to finally be making after almost 15 years. Seems like a pretty darn late &quot;fix&quot;, which is exactly what it is.</div></div><hr />

I've always felt that some of our mounts, like the proto-drakes, firehawks, and clefthoofs, were scaled much too big even for tauren size.<br />

a pretty obvious reason could be that they were looking at the races for the sets and fixed the bugs while doing so. but it sounds like they changed something tech wise to let them resize individual mounts.<br />

This forum is poison to any joy in the game, comments like this that literally don’t effect the game annoys the hell out of me. wowhead is far better, far more organized and less cancer. MMO champ, Chang your name to mmotrollcamp. The mods don’t care to moderate the direct disrespect, the owner of the site is collecting a check. <br />
<br />
It’s a bug that got fixed and doesn’t change anything and will benefit bigger races and people who see a clip or a bug in mounts on races they play. <br />
<br />
On the opposite end people would say that if they didn’t correct this mess, then they wanted people to PAY to race change gnome then to see the mount armor isn’t working right to PAY for a race change back. <br />
<br />
Cancer cancer cancer , call me a white knight but I feel like this site is littered poison at this point.<br />
<br />
Edit, it’s very very clear this site collects a check from blizzard but let’s the ignorance spew in is what I was saying. They don’t defend or TArY to bring direction of discussion and holds a huge group of players. MMO champ gets lots exclusives and still throws salt in the wound. No control, no ACTUAL mediation period wasted site. Ps Mediators control the conversation and keep it on point so many threads have been spewed with hate and meh I’m part time or volunteer and don’t care mods run this site. Continue feeding to this shit.</div></div><hr />

I'm almost afraid to log into my tauren and see what fresh hell awaits us. I really liked how a moose's run cycle was slower looking on that toon, they looked grand and epic riding into battle in a bg lineup. <br />

They're not increasing the size of the gnome player when he mounts, silly! The second picture is more zoomed in. Also, what are people reading wrong? They say mount size changes, your quote says mount size changes. I see no confusion here?</div></div><hr />

Wrong. Mount sizes are different and zoom is different. Gnome size is the same. Take a look at grass textures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What? You have it wrong - this is the funny site. This is where you come if you want to see creative negative comments about any change. For example - if you want to know why having more than one mount type walk on water is a bad thing, you come here. If you want to know why small weapons on female blood elves is a bad thing, you come here. And if you want to know why big weapons on female blood elves is a bad thing, you also come here.<br />
You also come here to see people say &quot;no because there is a workaround&quot;, &quot;no because it doesn't bother me&quot;, &quot;no because nobody cares&quot;, &quot;no because other things are more important&quot;. <br />
Seriously though, it seems to be a trend on forums in general. People sometimes forget what the point is and start specifically looking for things to complain and things to combat / argue against. /shrug</div></div><hr />

I'm looking at the pictures and the second one looks better. On the first one, the gnome doesn't reach the reins.<br />
Personally, I'm bothered when reins don't align, when legs clip through saddles or even the mount itself and so on. <br />
<br />
It's like every single change in this game. There will always be people who absolutely love something as is and can't bear to see changes. For example, when Thlusand Needles changed, I saw a lot of people crying that their favorite zone is now drowned in water - and that's one of the zones I really really disliked, it was a flat desert with almost nothing. Goes to show that people are very different, and what one may love, another may hate.<br />
This change too - some will love, some will hate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, I think fixing things is better than not fixing them in the long run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's honestly difficult to tell without an exact camera zoom (im sure there is a script that can be used rather than relying on number of mousewheel turns) but it does seem that the mounts are slightly smaller. <br />
<br />
However, without someone to compare against on both live and ptr at the same time, it's not completely clear as to how much of a change is is.</div></div><hr />
