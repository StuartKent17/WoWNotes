Legion Zone Preview - Azsuna<br />
Azsuna is home to the remnants of the ancient night elves ravaged by the wrath of Queen Azshara. This accursed land is rife with many mysteries, and serves as refuge to what remains of the Blue Dragonflight. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/august/thumb/azZP01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/august/azZP01.jpg) <br />
<br />
We sat down with Senior Game Designer Eric Maloof to get some insights on the zone and learn a bit more about what you’ll find there.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/august/thumb/azZP02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/august/azZP02.jpg) <br />
<br />
Q. How would you describe the zone’s ambience? What’s it like?<br />
<br />
Eric Maloof: Azsuna is a broken land. It’s been cursed for a little over 10,000 years, before the Sundering. It’s also an invaded land, and probably has the heaviest concentration of demons in the Broken Isles aside from the Broken Shore. The Burning Legion decided to use Azsuna as a major warfront, taking over the sub-island of Faranaar and also staging a fairly heavy incursion onto the Isle of the Watchers. From the Suramar side of things, they invaded and created the Felblaze Ingress, basically.<br />
<br />
I like to call Azsuna the research park of magic for the elves. The Academy was the center of magical knowledge before Queen Azshara sundered the Tidestone of Golganneth, which caused the curse. Basically, it killed all of the elves and doomed them to an eternal existence—rather than turning into wisps and returning to the Great Tree, they’re stuck here as ghosts.<br />
<br />
Azurewing Repose is a beautiful quest hub, where players see a different side of Blue Dragonflight from the one they’ve seen up to this point. What we see here is really a final retreat for the oldest living blue dragon, and he’s just hanging on by a thread because of the magic that’s infused in the island. The pool of magic that he’s resting in keeps him alive now—and that, in turn, is attracting the nightfallen and others from Suramar.<br />
<br />
Azsuna is punchy and has a lot going on. It’s probably the one zone that isn’t necessarily dominated by any one given force, because realistically no one really comes here. You don’t imagine the elves from Suramar coming here, because it’s cursed. Why would you come here? Really the only reason is because Azshara is like, “Yep, I’m after the Pillar of Creation now,” and the demons have invaded we have to stop these guys from doing this. We normally wouldn’t come here. You don’t want to go here. It’s like a horror story waiting to happen—but you really don’t have any choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/august/thumb/azZP03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/august/azZP03.jpg) <br />
<br />
Q. Which locations in Azsuna would you say are some of your favorites, and why?<br />
<br />
Eric Maloof: Well certainly Faranaar, just because of what happens to a place that was night elven and then gets hit with the full force of the Burning Legion. In lower Faranaar, where you do your level-up questing, you still have remnants of the elf ruins. But upper Faranaar is almost 100 percent just demons. This is what they do. This is what happens. This is what the whole world is going to end up looking like. The closest analog would be the demon world Mardum. So it sets the stakes for what we’re really fighting against here. I think we see a little of that in the invasions as well that are happening right now, but we don’t see as complete a takeover. You see the buildings coming in, and you can extrapolate what would happen.<br />
<br />
Another favorite of mine is the city in the Academy, the ruins of Nar’thalas. The team did just such an outstanding job to really get that vibe of “long, long, long ago, here was a really important point of elf civilization and it got smashed because of Azshara’s wrath.” I think the evolution—or de-evolution, when you compare it against some of the places in Suramar, for instance—is really interesting. The art kit is similar but aged and desaturated and cracked. I think it’s such an iconic anchor point of the zone.<br />
<br />

<br />
Q. Why do you think a player would want to start in this zone first?<br />
<br />
I honestly think all of the four level-up zones are extremely compelling. Certainly if they want to get more exposure to the immediacy of the Burning Legion, they’re going to get that out of Azsuna. <br />
<br />
Q. What is it that will bring players back to this zone?<br />
<br />
I’d say that when we were plotting out Azsuna, we put in a lot of spaces for top-level content, but with the scaling tech, we had a lot of opportunity for other content that we could satisfy everyone with.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/august/thumb/azZP05.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/august/azZP05.jpg) <br />
<br />
We set aside the Timeworn Strand for a PvP skirmish, so there’s a naga invasion on the west coast encroaching into these elf ruins that have slid off into the ocean. Who knows, it might have been the Sundering, it might have been the Shattering.<br />
<br />
We have the Isle of the Watchers, which is all top-level. There, the Wardens faction has you deal with these monstrosities that have broken out of the Vault of the Wardens dungeon and set up camp in various places. In addition, the Burning Legion has taken one of the towers and is fighting the Wardens for the other tower with their felsworn—basically, the demon hunters and others who have sworn their allegiance to the Burning Legion.<br />
<br />
Then we have the two dungeons, The Vault of the Wardens and the Eye of Azshara, which is magically connected to Azsuna. It’s effectively the dungeon staging area for Azshara’s forces as they either magically transport into the middle of the zone or swim up through the ocean, as we show when you’re coming into the zone for the first time.<br />
<br />
So yeah, we’ve got a lot of reason to come back—plus we have profession content spread throughout the zone as well.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Q. Is there anything else that players should look forward to here? <br />
<br />
There are so many little anecdotal things that might be too spoilery. One of the most compelling storylines focuses on Prince Farondis and his redemption. Here’s this guy who, in trying to do the right thing, damned his people for all eternity. He attempted to use one of the Pillars of Creation to stop Queen Azshara and the events at the Shattering with the Well of Eternity when that occurred. But in attempting to use an artifact of such immense titan power, Azshara got the drop on him, and all of his people blame him. To see him go through just being spit upon by his own people—and then going on to work with the player to help recover the Pillar of Creation—it’s really a redemption story. It’s really cool to see.<br />
<br />
Another good story is in the north, there’s a nightfallen who’s really trying to resist his condition. You’re kind of rooting for him and you’re not sure how things are going to turn out for him.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Broken Shore<br />
Has there been any comment on world pvp during invasions yet?<br />
Some may be rather upset with the results of the Broken Shore. No plans to stand in the way of their vengeance. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/763786581249359872))<br />
<br />
Is Broken Shore scenario skippable after one run as in beta? <br />
Yep! You'll have this option after completing the short post-Broken Shore chain that opens after Legion launch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/763785500758978560))<br />
<br />
Can you guys speed up the legion invasions? 4 hours when we finish them in 10 minutes is too long imo, have a great day <br />
This is only the beginning of the Legion's invasion. We'll be seeing a lot more of them leading up to launch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/763786192097714177))<br />
<br />
is next week the start of that second set of quests? Confused when we'll get that call from Khadgar, Magni, Jaina.<br />
Correct! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763796513990389761))<br />
<br />
Not everyone has the time (or ability i.e. health issues) to level a character to 100 in a few weeks or money to buy a boost.<br />
The Broken Shore is not time-limited, it will be around past 8/30. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763813254183260160))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
i know you are refraining from WoW tweets but are rocket boots and glider capes permanently gone from BG's?<br />
Not permanently (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/764163849993854976))<br />

Build of the Month - August 2016<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
All of the parts on this page are Amazon affiliate links. When you purchase your parts through them it helps support the site!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/august/ssdgraph.gif) are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.<br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7UZMAK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00L7UZMAK). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 6700K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Because even on a PvP server, zones like Dun Morogh do not force Alliance to be flagged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone looking to buy a ~970 should go for the RX 470. The 470 is roughly the same price as a used 970 and is roughly just as fast but a whole lot newer, is currently supported (aka not abandoned like Nvidia's 900 series who will not be receiving new drivers) and will most likely see some more performance improvements, is full DX12 ready, and more importantly comes with a full warranty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those cards are always out of stock anywhere you look just like Nvidia 1000 series. I'm pretty sure there was a good reason for putting the older hardware in the builds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It depends of the zone the invasion is active, wesfall, for example is an Ally zone, so Alliance players are not flagged for pvp there unless they want to. Same for N. Barrens and so on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
RX 470 is a best buy for $200 or under.<br />
<br />
Also, nobody in their right mind should buy AM3, especially FX-6300, when the i3-6100 destroys it for only 10$ more - while also opening an upgrade path.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do they suggest AMD processors then in their 'cheaper' builds. If I were to put together a 700 dollar gaming rig, no way in hell there'd be an AMD CPU in there. If anything, AMD's new GPU's are solid choices if you can get your hands on them. Their CPU's are still a crapshoot compared to Intel though.</div></div><hr />

I managed to get an honorable kill and spread my flame shock onto a Horde player without being flagged for PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't the invasion on a PvP server is a pain for sure, either full of horde of alliance, I usually end up having nothing but alliance on my horde account and horde on my alliance account. So I end up just tagging bosses and flying away.</div></div><hr />

lmao, not everyone should be playing this game then. its not like we had almost 2 years to level up to 100, its not like you get a free 100 lev boost with legion purchase... some people will still find excuses and ask for anything to be handed to them on silver platter, gosh...</div></div><hr />

No one asked for a free boost. The question was about the Broken Shore event being timed.<br />

You'd be surprised how many players who never get to max level during an expansion due to time restraints and playing in very short bursts.</div></div><hr />

With a free boosted character? You have to be especially lazy to not ever create the free one.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they don't want to boost and level their character by themselves and experience the game?</div></div><hr />

You'd be surprised how many players buy games to play them.<br />
<br />
I bought WoD last year on black friday sales and I already got 10+ max lvl characters. It takes me one month top when I am being lazy to level a character from lvl 1 to 100.<br />
<br />
Also it is very funny complaining about leveling now when you can get free levels in invasions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a lot of mistakes in this and other build logs, i wouldn't trust anything posted on MMO champs front page ( no offense MMO champ but stop giving misinformation out )<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
Also depending on your set up and how much background stuff you having going, a i7 isn't a bad choice for gaming. I find my CPU(specs in sig) being utilized on all different cores and more than 4 cores/threads are being use for day to day stuff. So while you only have a i3/i5 (no HT) you can run into performance issues due to the 2/4 threads being 100% utilized. People seem to forget the bigger picture here, yes you can run most games fine on a i3/i5 as long as you don't have a game that is using more than 2 cores and a lot of background tasks running.<br />
<br />
Also for gaming i wouldn't touch a AMD CPU when Intel CPU are not much more and have a lot better performance / thermals. Also the new AMD GPUs and the GTX 1060(equal to a GTX980) are cheap and will run WoW really good and most modern games @ 1080p</div></div><hr />

The S2716DG is the same resolution (1440p) as the one listed here, but it has a 144hz refresh rate. If you are spending close to $500 on a monitor, might as well invest a few more dollars for the higher refresh one. Currently discounted from $799.99 to $499.99 on amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0149QBOF0/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br />
<br />
disclaimer : the 144hz one is an TN panel versus the standard refresh one which is an IPS panel. Some may see a big difference in color reproduction using IPS versus TN. Many reviewers claim IPS is &quot;better&quot; than TN, but it's important to note that the TN panel used in this monitor is newer generation. Nevertheless, I found 144hz to be a giant improvement not only in WoW, but in many other games too<br />
<br />
edit: you need to have a G-SYNC compatible Nvidia graphics card to use the variable refresh rate feature of the monitor.<br />

Anyone looking to buy a ~970 should go for the RX 470. The 470 is roughly the same price as a used 970 and is roughly just as fast but a whole lot newer, is currently supported (aka not abandoned like Nvidia's 900 series who will not be receiving new drivers) and will most likely see some more performance improvements, is full DX12 ready, and more importantly comes with a full warranty.<br />
<br />
The 900 series will still get driver updates... lol. Maybe not as frequent as the 1000 series, but they'll still get updates.</div></div><hr />

Then they shouldn't be worried about not experiencing Broken Shore until later. Really not sure what you're trying to argue here.</div></div><hr />

Yes, totally stupid to let only one-handed caster stuff drop, nothing for off-hand or even a shield. Sad :mad:</div></div><hr />

It did turn out eerie that people were killing themselves around someone foretelling the end.<br />

And the doomsayers are secretly dreadlords. <br />
<br />
Just what will they do with all those sacrifices....</div></div><hr />

The Cooler Master HAF 912 ATX Mid Tower Case supports video cards up to 390mm long, but video cards over 270mm may block drive bays. Since the MSI GeForce GTX 1070 8GB Video Card is 279mm long, some drive bays may not be usable.</div></div><hr />
