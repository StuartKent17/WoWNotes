Why are you so excited for 8.1? You know the raid isn't being released December 11th right? It's going to be garbage story content and more WQ's/Warfronts/Isle Expeditions lol.</div></div><hr />

Way too soon tbh. Raid tiers should be 4-5 months minimum.<br />
<br />
Because if they aren't, then you end up with 18 month raid tiers at the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And, based on PTR testing, they aren't actually fixing much if anything. Ele Shaman still horribly broken. Frost Mages nerfed because performance in PvP (supposedly, lol) and M+, but at the bottom of raids so going to have to abandon that spec now too.<br />
<br />
And most of the discussion so far has been graphical nonsense. Cute, but people aren't leaving the game in droves because of the lack of graphical improvements.<br />

Shouldn't it be 8.3? If that's the case we can safely assume that something will happen to/with Sylvanas in 8.2, and then Azshara will actually be the final exp boss in 8.3 (setting up Nzoth for the next one?).</div></div><hr />

Nope, Azshara is being faced off in 8.2 in her palace. They're even thinking of a possible underwater boss and baby Naga themed boss in a hatchery. Naga lay eggs confirmed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If by better you mean higher quality, then yes, but that's it. That's all these new models have going for them. Like, THIS is what they've been repeatedly saying is coming for years now? Like, I look at these models and I just think they're incredibly lazy.<br />
<br />
Actually, the entire lot, all of it, every with this expansion just looks tired, bored and lazy. Its just copying legion mechanics and reskinning them to look new (except Azerite Gear, but we all know how much of a shit show that is on it's own anyways....)<br />
<br />
I said I'd keep an eye on blizzcon to see if anything was coming up to be worth resubbing, but.... no. There's nothng!<br />
<br />
Even their great achievement of being able to stuff bots into pvp now.... like.... is that because they just don't want to bother trying to fix things, so instead they'll create a bandaid fix and declare it's all hunky dory?<br />
<br />
No idea what it is, but something has gone horrifically wrong behind the scenes when it comes to this expansion. It FEELS like it's on life support.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is unexpected? They don't want to give flying, period, this is a grudging compromise. Has been since WoD. And, notice they didn't detail what new reps will be needed to grind to get it. <br />
<br />
I've been skeptical that Classic will effect retail...but I'm changing my stance on that. And, since they get a sub for it, BfA can fail further, and they still get their MAUs and money. <br />
<br />
I really wonder how many more expansions they can squeeze out of this game.</div></div><hr />

To everyone worrying about Sethrak, they don't necessarily need to come out in the same patch as the Vulpera. It could still be part of an ongoing story where the latter join the Horde first, shenanigans happen, and sometime later the Faithless decide to join the Alliance (alongside an unrelated Horde race).</div></div><hr />

To everyone worrying about Sethrak, they don't necessarily need to come out in the same patch as the Vulpera. It could still be part of an ongoing story where the latter join the Horde first, shenanigans happen, and sometime later the Faithless decide to join the Alliance (alongside an unrelated Horde race).<br />
<br />
Quite honestly? If they don't announce it now i can't be arsed. They don't do anything here to hook me... Nothing at all. Im glad you like the reskin but i don't... And seeing most votes on the topic... they are the least popular thing too. <br />
<br />
Its something the smallest group of people asked for. Everything else. LITERALLY EVERYTHING ELSE... is more interesting and more popular. I can't wait forever for Blizzard to get their shit together, and as small as it may be and as someone who always defended Blizzard where its due? ...this is my time to quit.</div></div><hr />

8.1 - Incursions, new storylines and war campaign, Darkshore quests/zone/Warfront, system changes like vendors, new islands and other minor stuff.<br />
<br />
After new year Dazal'alor raid, Mythic+ and PVP season 2.<br />
<br />
8.1.5 will have Zandalari/Kul TIran Allied race, Darkmoon Faire/events/Brawler's Guild update, Draenor Timewalking, minor stuff like portal rooms and very likely Stormsong raid.</div></div><hr />

Hmm. We already know that the player frees Xal'atath from the blade, however, and she becomes a void elf in appearance. So, it would be weird to have her continue whispering through the dagger.

<br />
That's a very immature position to take... Quit the game if you don't like it, but to do it in protest because you didn't get a random thing you were pining for? C'mon :D<br />
<br />
Allied races are about giving us more options. They're certainly not about dumping the most popular options first and keeping the least played ones in reserve (are you telling me if you get Sethrak now and mechagnomes in the 8.3 content lull you won't quit?). And yes, even less popular races should get a chance, otherwise we'd get 50 versions of elves and humans.<br />
<br />
Mechagnomes, whether you personally like them or not, add something new to WoW. They are the first mech race! And they are an opportunity to create some assets (mounts, gear, buildings, props, etc.) that can be used for the regular Gnomes as well, just like Highmountain did for Tauren. Newsflash, they sorely need it.<br />
<br />
I'm as much a fan of Sethrak for Alliance as anyone, I was among the first to champion the idea, and I will be deeply disappointed with Blizzard if they don't do it. But I don't expect them to come right this second. Let them work on proper customization and female models (ye, ye, I know about the female loa) and introduce them when it makes sense within the story.</div></div><hr />

8.1 is basically whey they implement most of the feedback they have gotten during the open beta that we're playing now (as in they fix most of the major bugs / failing systems). Raid will likely be opened in 8.1.5 which will be somewhere Q1 2019.</div></div><hr />

<br />
why ppl make suck a big deal about things like this lol<br />
<br />
Because it just fucks over the lore that they wrote way the fuck back in wrath, and invalidates all of that. <br />
<br />
Shit at this point I'm just ready to unsub until next summer. Maybe with a do-over we can get some expansions or new classic content that doesn't fucking suck dick. After legion I was hoping we'd be back on point, but this is worse than if you took and added the amount of shit and vitriol in wod to the amount horse cock and deep dicking we got in did it for the lulz april fools joke expansion.</div></div><hr />

We should believe that thrall is scratching his balls ? WTF . So abysmal about the conservancy and logic of the story, and yay, Sylvanas with and OLD GOD; WHO KNOW ?<br />
<br />
How about that Gnomes basically haven't had anything for 14 fucking years?? We took the surface of Gnomeregan back in Cataclysm, nearly 8 years ago, and since then we have had nothing.<br />
<br />
But no, we can't have anything Gnome based, it is far too much. For fuck sake.</div></div><hr />

Those are usually just in the patch details, unless they're very profound. These presentations are about the EXCITING stuff - you know, mounts, pets, and a Darkmoon Faire rollercoaster. Not the things that actually MATTER, like being able to play Shaman and not get laughed at.<br />

Warfronts will have more of a daily occurrence.<br />
War Mode will reward a faction more based on how many people are participating.<br />
<br />
Warfronts suck so, don't really care about that. War Mode better reward more to the faction with Less players, not more. Otherwise, well, why bother with <br />
warmode if you already know you'll be on the lesser end to start out with? I had turned it off near the end since it didn't reward anything at max level that I wanted. Then you have More profession quests. Really? Those sucked in Legion. Hopefully they don't lock the good stuff behind them. <br />

Zandalari and Kul Tiran being 8.1.5 means they won't be out until 2019 and same with the Raid. We've cleared Uldir Heroic and don't have anywhere near enough people to go Mythic so we're stuck for at least two months now until the Raid comes out. Warlords Timewalking was expected (give me that wolf), but why Grimrail is not part of it is beyond me. Brawler's Guild was another expected feature really, but it's content so that's something.<br />
<br />
The updates to Arathi Basin and Warsong Gulch are nice. They've been in the game since Classic and a visual update is much needed for something like this, I'm hoping they look at Alterac Valley and Eye of the Storm next to give them both a bit more gloss. Also Worgen and Goblin models were finally announced, and Female Worgen looks less like a demented chihuahua so it couldn't get worse. I'm very surprised however they didn't get Heritage Armour sets. Gnome and Tauren were surprising and unexpected but as I don't play either race, I can't get overly excited.<br />
<br />
Not much yet on Nazjatar but I can assume essentially Argus 2.0. Raid with big questing area to explore so it's ticks the boxes. Flying was expected to come at some point. Can't really get hyped for Mechagon and Mechagnomes. Gnomes are just meh to me. I think it pretty much confirms they will be an Allied Race (QQ). The lack of Allied Race talk with a bummer. It's something that can really hype people up and I didn't really get hyped from the things I've seen so far. This expansion still has major flaws with Classes and Azerite which is sapping a lot of my interest to play.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it was confirmed long ago that during BfA we will get at least 4, 2 at launch and 2 later. And that's what we've got. I seriously doubt that we will get more allied races during BfA than that.</div></div><hr />

I wonder why they didn't show the Moonkin form within that Kul Tiran human announcement, but they did for the Zandalari. Are they planning to change it?<br />

I wonder as well, maybe they reconsider the horrendous nightmare chicken of eternal dying laughter.. I'm still not sure if I should be creeped out or laughing my ass off at that one tbh. They also broke the &quot;genetic refuse that supposedly is related to a majestic owl&quot; restriction with zandalari already, not sure why they insisted to force that rubbish on the datamined model in the first place.<br />
<br />
Still kinda sad that they waste the drust (and dino models for the 8 y.o. out there) on these allied races, would have been nice if they had given them as the &quot;expansion bonus&quot; to each faction's druids, because after legion druids are now back to &quot;one form 100% of time&quot; and no cosmetic upgrades ever again, the same rubbiosh we had for 12 years and that was finally broken in legion.

<br />
Well that's the problem though, we have to be in our forms whenever we're in combat and shifting in/out puts things on GDC so it's pretty impractical to swap out all the time. Hence why we want options. Legion was cool for all the bears and cats because they got to have a different form for a bit, but it'd be nice to have different forms to look like. Right now my options are blue-transparent and hard to see regular self or boomchicken. Resto druids are the only ones that get to see their own transmog all the time right now:P <br />
<br />
It's certainly not a priority for me personally (and since I think I'm finally setting WoW down for good) but it's been something the druid community has wanted forever.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chrisisvacant</div><div class="date">2018-11-03, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that's the problem though, we have to be in our forms whenever we're in combat and shifting in/out puts things on GDC so it's pretty impractical to swap out all the time. Hence why we want options. Legion was cool for all the bears and cats because they got to have a different form for a bit, but it'd be nice to have different forms to look like. Right now my options are blue-transparent and hard to see regular self or boomchicken. Resto druids are the only ones that get to see their own transmog all the time right now:P <br />
<br />
It's certainly not a priority for me personally (and since I think I'm finally setting WoW down for good) but it's been something the druid community has wanted forever. Legion was a taste but would have been a nice continued feature and a cool thing to unlock, similar to warlock's green flame. It'd be cool to learn other druids' forms :3<br />
<br />
But you can transmog your weapon into the artifact and it grants you the artifact form. Sure, additional options would be cool (and I don't doubt there are ideas about that being discussed at Blizz) but we are not forced into our default anymore.</div></div><hr />

Yes its issue is alliance don't want to pvp meaning horde outnumbers them by a lot...that's exactly what he said... What's playing alliance and turning on war mode gonna show him that we don't already know? O_o <br />
Personally im ok with more incentive for alliance to flag themselves. More pve nerds for horde to slaughter :D</div></div><hr />

Digging the Steampunk theme though, if nothing else, and I'm still trying to terms with the fact that we're actually having significant gnome-themed content. It doesn't feel real yet.<br />

Not even Malfurion is pacifist. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Malfurion was never a pacifist. He believed in peace and he wanted to protect his people. He was pushed way over the edge when Sylyvanas brutally murdered nearly an entire capital city of men, women and children to try and provoke them. Now she gets to reap the results of such actions.<br />
<br />
I've never seen Malfurion act so ruthless, and it's kind of exciting. I wonder how deep his hated is going here, if he hates all of the Horde, or specifically those that played a role in the Teldrissal genocide?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alkizon</div><div class="date">2018-11-03, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The female worgen seem to be a compromise between the angry pocket dog and what most people have been requesting for years, I guess that is good enough and will have to do as a middle of the road solution. I had hoped for less awfully misaligned teeth on the male model, but it's better than the perpendicular 2 polygone ones we currently have.Postures looks decent for all models (I'm not sure, but beforehand I would say, that same way). In general, they are very similar to originals, except for most facial expressions are very &quot;cheerful&quot; (I hope this is being only for sketchs). And yes, worgen female would have looked more adequately (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1098880-Worgen-Add-Alpha-Female-Worgen-Model-Features-as-Options!!!) even if at least they had real wolve's (https://i1077.photobucket.com/albums/w470/Kiana_Lacy/explanation.png), but not puppy's eyes (https://media.gqindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dog-puppy-gq.jpg).<br />
<br />
New worgens have too underlined (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2446176-Goblin-and-worgen-models?p=50418674&amp;viewfull=1#post50418674) skin pattern (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2432401-Patch-8-1-0-PTR-Build-27826?p=50172497#post50172497), it would be much better not to have so much excess dirt on the body. Fortunately, it can be easily hide under armor.<br />
<br />
Summarizing: everything is good enough for now, it's evident that they decided to stick to 2nd option (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2420021-Metzen-Interview-about-Fandom-and-Toxicity?p=49931795#post49931795) to a greater degree (it's a pity that this wasn't priority during &quot;first&quot; alterations (classic (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2342358-Human-Female?p=48129206&amp;viewfull=1#post48129206)/BC races' reconstructions)).</div></div><hr />

He is not wrong though. Really digging the Nazjatar stuff and that we are finally getting updates for worgen, but since class design is more boring than ever, it hardly matters.</div></div><hr />

Yes you got a bunch of them during legion and that will be the only visual upgrade you will get for the next decade. All my other characters get 1-6 each content patch cycle. Would have been nice if it was a least 1 per expansion for druids.</div></div><hr />

Expansion has only been out for less than 3 months. You get the first big patch 4 months into the expansion. It used to be the case that we had to wait 6-7 months before the first patch hit.</div></div><hr />
