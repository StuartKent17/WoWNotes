PvP Tuning - February 6<br />
We’re currently working on some hotfixes for PvP tuning, intended to go live with the next weekly restarts. We’re planning the following changes:<br />
<br />
https://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
<br />
Protection<br />
<br />
Light of the Protector and Hand of the Protector’s healing reduced by 40% when engaged in combat with enemy players.<br />
Mana regeneration reduced by 30% when engaged in combat with enemy players.<br />
Developers’ Note: With the launch of 8.1, the additional healing granted by Hand of the Protector was changed to be based off of the target’s missing health, rather than the Paladin’s missing health. While healing is a core element of Protection Paladin survivability, this has proven to be more effective in PvP than intended. Protection Paladins should feel like they can survive high amounts of damage, and heal their teammates in a pinch, but not provide consistent and sustained healing to their teammates throughout a match.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
The absorb provided by Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism is now cleared at the start of an Arena or Battleground, and considered a Magic effect for dispels.<br />
Bwonsamdi’s Bargain can no longer prevent death while participating in Arenas or Rated Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 8.1 Hotfixes - February 1, 2019<br />
Classes<br />
<br />

<br />
Demonic Gateway should no longer change your camera facing after being cast on a boat, and the visuals will now play correctly when being cast on a boat.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Darkshore<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that was preventing some players from Bonus Rolling on the Darkshore World Boss.<br />
Developers’ notes: This issue was quite challenging to solve, and we’d like to thank players who reported occurrences of it to Blizzard Customer Support.<br />
<br />
Battle of Dazar’alor<br />
<br />
Lady Jaina Proudmoore<br />
<br />
Adjusted Ice Shard and Grasp of Frost so that Jaina will cast while moving and be easier to maneuver around the field.<br />
Fixed a bug where the Ice Shard debuff on Heroic and Mythic difficulties was not increasing in damage as stated in the tooltip.<br />
Fixed a bug where players were unintentionally gaining additional stacks of Chilling Touch on Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Sinister Gladiator Azerite items upgraded by a Battleborn Sigil or Warlord's Trophy now have the correct amount of stamina.<br />
Resolved an issue that prevented the Insignia family of PvP trinkets (such as Sinister Gladiator's Insignia) from being activated by heals.</div></div><hr />

seriously, wowprogress could manually update that, at least during the world first race...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're certainly correct on the 9 guild part, but China shutdown their API in 2016. It's just raider.io manually inputting guilds rather than a flaw in the website's process. Probably just people letting them know directly in their discord.<br />
<br />
This is the page MMOC could use if they choose to screenshot/link to it in the future <br />

In F1 the leader can have a 50 second lead and still end up with a DNF.<br />
<br />
An advantage is no guarantee of success.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aside from Jaina and maybe the first boss being a little easy, seems pretty well tuned. There's a lot of drop off through the ranks like it should be and there's no reason to tune for the top .1%, tune for the normal mythic player so you don't have nerf a billion times.</div></div><hr />

Can we really compare Asia with everyone else? Is the game now like two different games?!?!/</div></div><hr />

<br />
The sub is different and some models are different. The mechanics, health, damage, and everything else about the raid is the same. The only reason China isn't included on wowprogress is due to API issues and the fact that wowprogress is lazy. Korea, Taiwan, and Russia are on there just fine, so using &quot;Asia&quot; as a descriptor is incorrect.<br />
<br />
There are 20 guilds on 8/9M as of this comment, 2 NA, 14 EU, 3 CN, 1 KR.</div></div><hr />
