&quot;Overpowered&quot; AE Spells in WotLK<br />
Maybe I'm misremembering something, but the goal going into LK was that warriors should be able to AE tank rather than every group using paladins for trash, and that casters should be able to use their AE spells, otherwise what are they there for? We succeeded in both of those, but a little too well on the latter to the extent that anything with more than 1 mob became a job for Blizzard / Hurricane / Mind Sear, etc.<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm, there will be more threat to the tank of dying if you try to just AE tank every pull. Likewise, AE damage won't be quite as awesome so that single targeting things will probably be a better strategy when there are say 3-5 adds. If it's a dozen twilight whelps, then sure, AE away. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401521630/twitter-chat-on-warrior-aoe-tanking/))<br />
<br />
Haste on channeled spells in Cataclysm<br />
It's probably more accurate to say that the haste will lower the duration until you earn a whole additional tick, at which point the duration will go back up again (but with more damage / healing because of that extra tick). Getting more haste will never be a bad thing, but there will be break points where haste is more valuable than others. You should also never want to cancel the spell early.<br />
<br />
This is definitely one of those cases where we'll have to see how it feels, but it is more intuitive when you're actually casting spells in the game than it might sound on paper. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401510851/cata-haste-and-channeled-spells/))<br />
<br />
[...] The answer we were trying to give was that &quot;channels won't just get shorter and shorter the more haste you get.&quot; But a more complete answer is that hasted channels will get shorter until you get a whole additional tick, at which point the duration will go back up again. We don't want to do partial ticks or things like that because they encourage you to just recast the spell. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401480391/clarification-haste-affecting-channel-spell/))<br />
<br />
Overused stats in WotLK<br />
Yeah, I agree with that. For a number of reasons (that I've gone into before), we allowed some stats to become much more valuable than competing stats that also occur on your gear. We're really trying to prevent this in Cataclysm. We're making changes including, but not limited to, letting hots and dots crit, asking healers to care about mana regen, getting rid of group buffs that improve hit, keeping combat rating from getting inflated, etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262371492/crit-healing-poor-design-choice-even-if-op/))<br />
<br />
Healing and mana regeneration / stats effect<br />
Yes, I agree that having high mana regeneration will allow you to use inefficient spells more often. I was reacting against some of the player saying they would just stack Spirit and nothing else because Spirit also allows you to cast big heals or fast heals more often. A hasted Flash of Light is still going to be pretty good in many situations, as is a Flash of Light that crits for a big amount. The numbers should be such that all stats are valuable, not that the guides say &quot;Stack Spirit and all other stats are garbage.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401480001/quot-it-matters-where-the-paladin-is-quot/))<br />
<br />
[...] We don't want that either, and in the absence of a five second rule, it won't help you that much anyway. Instead, we want you to choose whether you use your GCD on a moderate heal, a huge heal or a fast heal. Today almost every GCD is spent on the fast heal because someone will die if you don't do that and your mana regeneration supports that play style.<br />
<br />
Now, we might slow combat down a little to the point at which you have enough time to make a decision about which heal to cast, but that can probably be on the order of 0.5 to 1.0 sec and not 2-5 sec. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401901650/my-issue-with-mana-changes/))<br />
<br />
Heroic Leap and &quot;old&quot; abilities in Cataclysm<br />
We change our minds sometimes, like about letting Charge work in combat for example. :)<br />
<br />
In fact, one of the reasons we changed our minds about Heroic Leap (and Camo, and Trap Launcher) were so many players that were sad about seeing those abilities not make it in LK. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/15207814673/bogus-heroic-leap-removal-reason/))<br />
<br />
AE Tanking in Cataclysm<br />
Some of you seem to be confusing intensity with diversity. It's easy to imagine a world where a class has one AE tool that works phenomenally well and a different class that has several AE tools, none of which actually allow them to tank worth a hoot. There seems to be some kind of logic train (wreck?) here that because some classes got abilities that might be useful when AE tanking that we are wrong / changed our minds / lying about how often you will be AE tanking in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Our goals are that you won't be spending as much of your tanking time AE tanking in Cataclysm as you did in Lich King. A second goal is that when you are AE tanking, you should use different abilities than when you are single-target tanking. A third goal is that when you are AE tanking, you should use more than one (or maybe two) abilities. None of those seem contradictory.<br />
<br />
If you want to challenge our goals as being unrealistic or dumb, then feel free. But we're seeing a lot of this inductive (specific to general) logic where a player tries to poke a hole in one ability and use that to mean our goals can't possibly be met.<br />
<br />
Try one of these arguments instead:<br />
<br />
1) I disagree with Blizzard putting more emphasis on crowd control and single-target damage.<br />
2) I agree or am ambivalent about that goal, but I don't see how we'll get there because of X reason.<br />
3) I agree or am ambivalent about that goal, but I don't see how Y ability will help realize that goal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401521630/twitter-chat-on-warrior-aoe-tanking/))<br />

Tranquility / Healing in Cataclysm<br />
He meant this. Tranquility will always be raid wide, just because the concept of a &quot;group&quot; within the raid is kind of a strange one. What does that group refer to in the game? It's not distance for example. We'd like to do this with every spell.<br />
<br />
As far as druids being too powerful because hots are too powerful in a world where they don't overheal as much, that is definitely on our radar. Hots can be good and the &quot;druid thing&quot; without druids spamming nothing but Rejuv (&quot;Because if I cast anything but Rejuv, then I'm not a druid!&quot;).

Healing Hands<br />
Healing Hands is one of the ways we want to let paladins raid heal and it might even be the dominant way. We want to give them a group heal that isn't Circle of Healing or Chain Heal, because we've already done those spells and we want to do something new here.<br />
<br />
What we want to avoid: &quot;Well, we don't have our paladin tonight to heal the tank, so let's call the raid.&quot;<br />
<br />
What we also want to avoid: &quot;Well, we have too many paladins and they can't raid heal, so let's replace one with an undergeared alt.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are extremes of course. All things being equal, we'd rather you not stack too many of any one spec. We just don't want to make it impossible to heal a raid if your group of friends just happens to have a lot of Holy paladins. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401521191/hh-and-blizz-s-theory-someone-clarify/))<br />
<br />
Critical Healing (Mastery)<br />
I'm not sure I understand the logic here. Having larger crits makes crit chance attractive on gear, but I don't think the reverse is true. You won't be at a disadvantage if you have high crit and low mastery because you will just crit more often. You won't be at a disadvantage if you have low crit and high mastery because when you do crit, your heals will be larger. Crit and mastery do complement each other well and I can understand why it might be a problem if haste and Spirit weren't attractive stats so you were pigeon-holed into just crit + mastery gear, but those should both be very good stats.<br />
<br />
(I'm ignoring the effects of Illumination, overhealing and the (specious) argument that &quot;crit is inherently bad because it's RNG&quot; to keep things simple, so let me know if any of those is key to understanding this.) <br />
<br />
If at any point in the expansion crit is a poor stat for paladins, they have no third stat to retreat to.<br />
I agree with this, but that's like saying that if at any point in the expansion Holy damage is a poor damage source for Retribution, they would have no other spell damage source to focus on. If paladins don't care about crit, then we have a problem. It doesn't matter at that point that they care more about crit than other healers. Disc priests care less about crit than they might because of Power Word: Shield, but that doesn't mean crit won't improve their healing.<br />
<br />
So if you're arguing the flaw is that there is a risk to the paladin if crit isn't valuable, then I guess I see that. If you're arguing there is just an inherent flaw no matter what, then I'm not following you. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262371492/crit-healing-poor-design-choice-even-if-op/))<br />
<br />
Group Healing<br />
I think there is a problem now because more throughput (in terms of bigger heals because of crits) is wasted on overhealing. Paladins rarely have trouble healing a single target to full. Their problem is not having enough GCDs to bring up everyone before the next round of damage happens again. That won't be the case in Cataclysm hopefully. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262371492/crit-healing-poor-design-choice-even-if-op/))<br />

Prayer of Healing<br />
We'd like to change PoH too. The challenge there is making it not feel like CoH. <br />
<br />
[...] Right. I mentioned this in another thread today, but you have a few broad options: either PoH heals the 5 most injured folks (in which case it's a lot like Circle) or it heals the whole raid (in which case it's likely overpowered or not useful enough) or it has a longer cooldown to compensate for the previous (in which case it's a lot like Divine Hymn) or it heals the target and the 4 closest targets (in which case it's like old CoH).<br />
<br />
It's a goal to get it to not be group only. It's just a tricky goal. At the very least it's not as bad as Tranquility since you don't have to decide what group the priest is in ahead of time. There are spells that still suffer that restriction, and we'd like to change them too if possible. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401510495/uhh-tree-druids-does-no-one-see-the-op/))<br />

Improving Warrior AE Tanking<br />
We could increase the damage of Thunder Clap and Shockwave if we needed to. I'm not convinced we'll need to, particularly in a world with the Vengeance concept. Warrior AE threat was generally fine in Naxxramas. It only started to slip in later tiers, and in comparison to (some) other tanks. <br />
<br />
[...] Not every new spell is there to help realize those goals. If we wanted to give warriors a new AE ability, we'd give them something either spammable or persistent. We're just not sure they need a new tool in that space. Any balance issue can be solved with number tweaking of existing tools.<br />
<br />
[...] I don't think warriors have any AE issues now, except for two: some classes have to do less work to AE tank, and the threat generation doesn't scale with gear as well as it needs to. Again, we don't want to make tanking just hitting one button or a macro. It's not a matter of giving you an ability for any conceivable situation you might find yourself in. It's only a problem if you're horribly broken in those situations and I don't really think warriors are there. As I've said before, we like how warriors AE tank. It generally works. It didn't work when Tclap had a 4 target limit.<br />
<br />
Do you really struggle for example in 5-player heroics? Did you struggle in Naxx? Did you wipe a lot on Ony whelps when a warrior tanked them? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401521630/twitter-chat-on-warrior-aoe-tanking/))<br />
<br />
AE Tanking in Cataclysm<br />
There will almost certainly be staggered adds sometimes. It won't be every encounter. In those situations you'll need to use your full tool box to handle them. Maybe you need to save Thunder Clap for a few seconds. Maybe the rogue and hunter help pull the adds to you. Maybe you Devastate and tab. Maybe you blow Challenging Shout. Maybe you blow Intimidating Shout until Thunder Clap has finished its cooldown. If we wanted you to always have an answer for every single add situation, then Thunder Clap would have no cooldown. That would make tanking easier for sure. Is making tanking easier really more fun? At what point is it so easy that you're just standing there getting beat on?

Except that Heroic Leap as portraited atm is nothing like it was in WOTLK beta, so it isn't bringing back what the players were sad about.<br />
Actually it pissed me off when I first saw it, as it used to be a tool for fury warriors and now is only aimed towards Battle stance and possibly talented def stance.</div></div><hr />

I really hope they remove all the AoE, its very boring. It has dumbed down dps ALOT. Seems like most dps classes are just doing 1-2 attacks in most heroics. Everyone forgot LOS, CC, silence pulls. Could be a problem with two must scaling also, when lich came out 3000 dps was pretty good in raids. Now you do 10 000 or more (well not me, but those in the latest tier). Why such huge scaling?</div></div><hr />

Last time around they reversed all AOE healing and instead created a bunch of crappy buff spells to use with the 2 main healing spells. That created endless issues cause palas had zero choise. WIth the current changes- palas will still be lacking choise - specially if they are pretty much removing BOL in current form - and sacred shield has become pointless tool in most cases anyway. <br />
<br />
What I do not understand - is how blizzard thinks that having expensive fast heals is gonna help the game. But ofc - thats done because of PVP so yet again Arena goes a long way to destroy the PVE content of the game. <br />
<br />
And how on earth can they be so naive that ppl will not just stack spirit? IF the fast heal is becoming more expensive - then why on earth use haste to be OOM even faster ? And for palas... Crit has very little advantage since it doesnt save mana as much as before- and you should NEVER count on a crit to save a person from death. Crit healing will ONLY cause Overheals - thats why palas have been plauged with endless overheals. If they are gonna try to force ppl to take 2-5% extra crit and thinking that will make any diffrence.. then OMG are they naive. <br />
<br />
Maybe by giving each crit a hot effect - that would tick faster with increased haste. But I doubt they will be so smart.</div></div><hr />

You need to think about what healing will be like in the future, not what it is like now.<br />
The pace of healing will be slowing down so most of the time you won't need your fast expensive heal, but there will be moments when all hell breaks loose you will need a fast heal to snipe heal people before they die.<br />

Just a wild guess, since mana regen is getting nerfed across the board for everybody, spirit will probably be a weak-ish stat; that is, we would have to stack so much of it at the detriment of other stats to get half-decent regen that it won't be worth it.<br />

<br />
Hense I can see that after a point people will return to stacking Haste and Spellpower.<br />
<br />
As for heroics, I'd be all for having an 'Elite' setting that scales with the tier. Much tougher mobs and bosses, almost like a mini-raid in difficulty, but with improved rewards and a high gear requirement to even enter them in a PUG.<br />
<br />
i.e If it was during Wrath then during Ulduar the Elite setting would drop Conquest badges, during TOC it would drop Truimpth, etc. But each new tier the scaling ramps up to continue the challenge. Something facerollers would complain about, but all the serious players would rejoice at.<br />
<br />
Edit: And you'd use the fast expensive heals when a tank is about to drop dead and you need half a second for another healer to drop a big heal on them. Its about teamwork, not solo-healing everything. Which is totally doable in some situations right now...</div></div><hr />

They've said they're giving DPS casters other ways to regen their mana without having to stack spirit. How exactly they're going to accomplish that we don't know, but I believe they've said on several occasions that the intent is for DPS casters to not have to stack spirit.<br />

I don't follow your flawed logic : /<br />
<br />
When tankhealing as a shammy I just placed my earthshield on him and spammed lesser healing wave all day long, and a occationall Healing wave after a riptide (for the haste). LHW is less hpm (healing per mana) then Healing wave. Thus they are more expensive. ONLY holy paladins have EVER had the fastest heal be the cheapest one, and I'm guessing you are one since you seem pretty spoiled in that department.<br />
<br />
About the bolded part: I don't follow your train of thought here. It seems you don't get what's goinf to change in cata. have fun whining mr.paladin :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe they have said &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;small&quot; in the same description before. In any case, I would expect it to be something like 1/2 the cast time of the default heal but at 2/3 or 3/4 the mana cost, similar to the way it is now.<br />
<br />
What I'm not sure about is how they're going to handle the big heal, since they've described it as being completely different than you're imagining it. According to them, the big heal is also supposed to be inefficient (or at least not as efficient), but will deliver a greater healing amount per second cast. For example, imagine the default heal takes 3.0 seconds to cast, costs 30 mana, and delivers 300 healing. The large heal would take 4.0 seconds to cast, cost 60 mana, and deliver 500 healing. Less total cast time, more total healing per second, but at a greater total cost.<br />
<br />
The way I believe they're intending it is that the middle heal is the one you cast when you're just restoring health as a matter of course. The small heal is the one you use to &quot;snipe&quot; and save people when they would die before the time it would take for the default heal to cast, and the large heal is the one you cast on the tank while he takes huge hits from a boss because the middle heal won't be able to keep up with the incoming damage forever.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind all of this could be completely wrong, but that's the way I understand it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I agree with that. For a number of reasons (that I've gone into before), we allowed some stats to become much more valuable than competing stats that also occur on your gear. We're really trying to prevent this in Cataclysm. We're making changes including, but not limited to, letting hots and dots crit, asking healers to care about mana regen, getting rid of group buffs that improve hit, keeping combat rating from getting inflated, etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262371492/crit-healing-poor-design-choice-even-if-op/))<br />

I though the same as well, I think we just automatically read it that way as that is the model we are used to at the moment. I've had a search through US and EU blue quotes and can't find any that use the word small in conjunction with the fast heal. Perhaps they are leaving it vague on purpose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Hots gaining extra ticks with haste. <br />
2) Hots now being critable.<br />
3) Hots doing more healing when target is at low hp.<br />
3) ToF making regrowth instant and making lifebloom give 2 stacks.<br />
4) Tranquility being raid-wide.<br />
<br />
Too many buffs compared to other classes. This will make Resto Druids much more valuable then Priest and Shamans when it comes to raid healing, especially in 10 mans. In 10 man, it will be bring a Resto Druid and random healer for tank healing (maybe a 3rd healer for 10man hc). In 25 man they will dominate by far as well, now that the raid will never be full health, so they will always be 100% efficient and providing excellent &quot;Oh Shit!&quot; healing. <br />
<br />
Guilds will go with 3 resto druids, 1 paladin, 1 priest (disc) and priest (holy)/resto shaman.<br />
<br />
Even though Resto Shamans got some awesome spells, they look excellent on paper, but won't be that good in actual play.<br />
<br />
1) Healing rain. Has a long cd, diminishing returns, applied to an area rather then directly on players, meaning if players move from that area, the healing is lost. Whereas Wild Growth does not have are restriction and much lower cd.<br />
<br />
2) Spirit Walker's Grace. Spells can now be casted while moving, 2 mins cd. Whereas ToF now makes Regrowth instant and LB provide 2 stacks. Not to mention the hots. <br />
<br />
3) Spirit Link. No info on this, but by looking at things, it is a damage reduction spell, one which takes some damage from the target and applies it to another. Nothing special really.<br />
<br />
Disc Priest are the only healers which look decent besides Resto Druids. Because they bring damage reduction. Disc Priest + Resto Druid = win for any 10man raid. I am not really familiar with all the Holy Priest and Holy Paladin changes (as I don't play either of them) but they don't look so awesome.<br />
<br />
I know these are not the final changes and we have beta and haven't seen the encounters. But these are some legit concerns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Here's a bit more clarification on some of these changes. Also, please keep in mind that this is merely a preview and we'll still have more to go in testing up to and including any other changes that aren't listed here in the preview.<br />
<br />
We've updated the Flash of Light reference to make it a bit more clear in the original post as follows.<br />
<br />
Flash of Light remains a fast heal, but will be more expensive to justify the cast speed. Holy Light will be the go-to heal that has average efficiency and throughput. Beacon of Light needs to be changed so that its benefit is letting the paladin heal two targets at once, not letting the paladin get two heals for the mana cost of one. It’s intended to save GCDs and targeting time, not mana.<br />
<br />
In addition we’re changing the paladin heal design to match that of the other healers. Holy Light is the middle heal. It’s very efficient, but not particularly fast and doesn’t have a lot of throughput. Flash of Light will be the faster heal that costs more mana. (Currently paladins sort of flip the model around by having a fast, efficient heal.) Holy paladins can talent into an additional heal that is like a giant Holy Light. It might take three of these big heals (or two crits) to get a tank from death’s door back to 100% health.<br />
<br />
Currently on live, Beacon of Light is a tool that allows paladins to target more than just the main tank. In Cataclysm if it just doubles their healing, it is going to be overpowered. We have two ways we might handle this and we’ll experiment to see which feels better. The first is that Beacon only works on some heals, such as Flash of Light or Holy Light (but not the big one). An alternative idea is that Beacon increases the mana cost of a heal cast on a beaconed target, since you’re essentially getting a double heal. Under this model, Beacon itself would cost no mana.<br />
<br />
Also on the live realms currently, paladins have huge mana pools and massive throughput. The trade-off is that they are excellent single target healers and much weaker in other roles. We want paladins to be slightly more interchangeable with other healers. In Cataclysm, you should be able to have a Holy priest on the tank and a Holy paladin on the raid. We’re not sure we’ll back off of the current healing roles completely, but we definitely want to add more breadth to those whose roles are currently too narrow.<br />
<br />
As for the Guardian of Ancient Kings. First, it's important to understand that this is not a pet nor does it have a pet bar associated with it. Second, it's also not meant to last for very long. So, it's not a pet in the traditional sense. It's a friend in need when you need it, but not a permanent companion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin Healing model<br />
We talked a lot about keeping the paladin model inverted, where the small heal is super efficient. There is probably a way it could still work. In the end we were just concerned that it would end up biting us in the rear. Somewhere along the way we'd have to make special rules to handle the paladin, who would risk being too mana efficient or too incapable of healing when forced to heal outside of their mana-efficient comfort zone. Could we have designed it? Probably. But frankly I'd rather spend our time on more interesting mechanics and spells. I'd rather the new AE heal really make paladins feel like they can AE heal rather than really making sure FoL felt small, cheap and fast. I agree it erodes a little bit of distinction among the classes, but only a little bit. There are far more interesting ways to make healers feel unique than in the relative mana efficiency of their small spell.

<br />
I really hope they remove all the AoE, its very boring. It has dumbed down dps ALOT. Seems like most dps classes are just doing 1-2 attacks in most heroics. Everyone forgot LOS, CC, silence pulls. Could be a problem with two must scaling also, when lich came out 3000 dps was pretty good in raids. Now you do 10 000 or more (well not me, but those in the latest tier). Why such huge scaling?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
200 ilvl (epic) 2h weapon = 186,6 dps (http://www.wowhead.com/item=39393)<br />
<br />
245 ilvl - 2h weapon = 255,7 dps (http://www.wowhead.com/item=47069)<br />
<br />
264 ilvl - 2h weapon = 294,7 dps (http://www.wowhead.com/item=50415)<br />
<br />
277 ilvl - 2h weapon = 325,7 dps (http://www.wowhead.com/item=50603)<br />
<br />
284 ilvl - 2h weapon = 344,2 dps (http://www.wowhead.com/item=50730)<br />
<br />
Look at the difference in dps! Almost double. Sure, most people have weapon at 245 - 251 range, still weapon dps scaling is ... mind boggling.<br />
<br />
Look at the difference between 245 and 284 weapon. more than 30% better dps from weapon alone, yet ilevel difference is only 15,9%</div></div><hr />

Healing Hands<br />
Healing Hands is one of the ways we want to let paladins raid heal and it might even be the dominant way. We want to give them a group heal that isn't Circle of Healing or Chain Heal or HEALING STREAM TOTEM, because we've already done those spells and we want to do something new here (OH WAIT HEALING STREAM TOTEM).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Except that the proposed ability is completely unlike Healing stream Totem. First, there's mobility. If HST is like Death and Decay, the new Paladin heal is like Swipe. D&amp;D is great (in some ways better) if you know where the MoBs will be, and won't need to move them. Swipe is much better if the MoBs spawn randomly or you have to move them around. The Paladin will become the mobile source of group healing, as opposed to a totem which is a statically placed item that you have to avoid getting out of range for. <br />
<br />
Perhaps more importantly, I assume, the new Paladin ability will be a real heal, ticking for a reasonable amount of health. HST just ticks for a little bit to kind of offer supplemental heals. You can't &quot;raid heal&quot; with HST except in the most trivial of circumstances.<br />
<br />
Edit: As I think about it, the Totem is even more limited than D&amp;D, because it only appears near the Shaman's current location. It's more like Consecrate. Great if you happen to be standing where you need the threat, but not so much if you need to move.</div></div><hr />

Too many buffs compared to other classes. This will make Resto Druids much more valuable then Priest and Shamans when it comes to raid healing, especially in 10 mans. In 10 man, it will be bring a Resto Druid and random healer for tank healing (maybe a 3rd healer for 10man hc). In 25 man they will dominate by far as well, now that the raid will never be full health, so they will always be 100% efficient and providing excellent &quot;Oh Shit!&quot; healing. <br />
<br />
<br />
You're overreacting. You are viewing these changes against the current environment and context. It's as if you think these changes are coming in just another patch. I don't think you realise how much things will change in Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
All health pools will be huge relative to where they are now. In addition, the mana costs of all spells will greatly increase. This will have a huge impact on overhealing. With the additional changes to the paladin healing model, for example, I'm guessing overhealing will be rare. In such an environment, stats like haste, if they were kept as they are now, would actually be a significant disadvantage. You would eat through mana while gaining next to nothing. That's why haste, and to a lesser extent crit, is being re-worked. If druids attempted to spam Rejuv as they do now, by raid-wide pre-hotting against incoming damage (effectively acting like super-efficient PWS shielders), they would be OOM in next to no time. Most of the time all healers will simply not be able to afford keeping everyone topped up nor will they need to (due to incoming damage changes).<br />
<br />
In other words, if anything druids are going to be the most affected by all the changes because due to lots of HoT spells, many of them instant, and now with much higher mana costs, they will not be able to chain HoTs per target or spam group wide heals. Even when they do, if their spells remained exactly as they are now, their HoT spells alone would be by far the most inefficient healing from the the lowest health. This is why HoT Scale Healing was introduced - it improves throughput for &quot;boot-strap&quot; heals in particular.<br />
<br />
With regards to Tree of Life, no one knows how long and how often the cooldown can be used. And in fact, they haven't set in stone (certainly not published) what it will actually do. If they make it too powerful and general, it becomes a huge crutch for druids. Their healing will be luckluster or even gimped whenever they are not able to use ToL. It would also make a mockery of Blizzard's class balancing system since healers are balanced in caster form without taking into account active cooldowns. If they make it too powerful but situational, it could end up becoming like the current Tranquility. People will start to realise its simply not needed most of the time, its tricky to organise in a raid and eventually (especially due to passive bonuses that require respeccing into), they could just ignore it all together. So, making a ToL that is useful but not a crutch and not situational to the point of being useless, will be very tricky indeed. This is one of the reasons why some PvE healing druids did not want ToL to be switched from passive to active - they would rather it had been removed entirely if they could no longer have a mainly passive healing ability for sustained healing throughput.<br />
<br />
As for tranquility becoming raid-wide, well every other healer has more oh-shit buttons - especially paladins. Priests also have a viable raid-wide oh-shit button (Divine Hymn + Divine Aegis). How come druids are the only ones without oh-shit buttons? Nature's Swiftness barely counts since all other healers have at least that button. So, finally they make Tranquility useful.<br />
<br />
TL;DR. The druid changes cannot be considered in isolation, especially not against the current healing environment, type of incoming damage and stat system. They could be fair changes or even underpowered and situational come Cataclysm. In addition, Cataclysm will be the expansion of reactive healing not pro-active healing. This is a big blow to the current druid healing model - certainly druids are the most affected due to the ease of pre-hotting - and, in my opinion, a power shift towards preventative healing (priests and to a lesser extent paladins).</div></div><hr />

People really need to get out of thinking that the next expansion means were playing wow version 4.0 and instead think of it as become WoW2, i.e. how things are and interact now all stops and a whole new system is coming in.<br />
<br />
Maybe even with extra hot ticks the the total healing provided is less than now<br />
Maybe the new hot crits only bring it up to the current levels<br />
etc<br />
<br />
We don't know (possibly Blizzard isn't certain either) and won't until people start getting into the Beta.<br />

What they [Blizz] are doing is putting in tools (namely Mastery) to make their life easier with regards to balancing the various specs, though that's just one of the possibilities.</div></div><hr />

I dunno what Pallys have that really counts as a good &quot;oh shit&quot; button, but I'm not familiar with them. Shaman on the other hand I'm very familiar with and I don't really have an &quot;oh shit&quot; button. I mean sure I'll hit nature's swiftness to get off an instant CH but that only affects up to 4 targets. The tranquility change is less to make it such a button but more to make it make sense. Make it hit the whole raid rather than just these 5 people that are spread out at unlimited distances. At least that's what I'm getting out of it anyway.</div></div><hr />

Single target tanking is a fail concept. They tried it in classic and it was a fail. You needed to offtank in UBRS, in MC. For Luci you needed 3 tanks, after Luci for the core hound packs you needed like 5 tanks. For Garr you needed 4 warlock tanks and 4 warrior offtanks plus a main tank. For Sulfuron you needed 4 offtank + 1 mt. For Majordomo you needed 4 offtanks + 4 mages and 1 mt. It sucked balls back then.<br />
<br />
In BWL they shifted to AOE tanking it was refreshing. In AQ too. Naxx40 was out for a very short time as lvl60 instance to be any concern.<br />
<br />
From Karazan, through BT, SWP, Ulduar, TOC till ICC you need to AOE tank. In BC HCs they still stubborlny insisted to CCs. I played a shaman back then who had no CC, I couldn't run HCs because everyone was looking for 3 mages. It was a major PITA. Anyway, I have 4 tank alts and I enjoy AOE tanking much more. As DPS I love it.<br />
<br />
I predict this &quot;emphasis on CC&quot; will be a fail concpet again and they will shift back to AOE tanking after the first tier of dungeons. To make this shift smoother warrior AOE threat must be looked at like: thunderclap should be a presistent AOE spell like D&amp;D or Concecration OR WW or Cleave in def stance should work like druid's swipe ability. AOE threat thru mobility (like warbringer, intervane) is not really a desired thing when mages casting Blizzard, warlocks ROF, or cats positioning frontal swipes, etc, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes he did, and he's right. The cases where you would use IS when tanking are rare, but they're most certainly called for in the situation he's talking about (more adds show up while other AE abilities are on cooldown). This allows you to establish a baseline on all of the mobs while giving your TC time to come back online. When they return, you clap. Of course, it's highly situational. You never do this when there's the chance that the feared mobs will just bring in more adds or when someone in your party has already established a large amount of agro on the new mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So...in the extremely rare event where using it WON'T pull more mobs, you're saying that fearing the mobs (thus losing rage from not being hit, also damage shield not putting threat on them) is beneficial? <br />
<br />

We'd like to change PoH too. The challenge there is making it not feel like CoH.<br />
<br />
[...] Right. I mentioned this in another thread today, but you have a few broad options: either PoH heals the 5 most injured folks (in which case it's a lot like Circle) or it heals the whole raid (in which case it's likely overpowered or not useful enough) or it has a longer cooldown to compensate for the previous (in which case it's a lot like Divine Hymn) or it heals the target and the 4 closest targets (in which case it's like old CoH).<br />
<br />
It's a goal to get it to not be group only. It's just a tricky goal. At the very least it's not as bad as Tranquility since you don't have to decide what group the priest is in ahead of time. There are spells that still suffer that restriction, and we'd like to change them too if possible. (Source)<br />
<br />

TL;DR. The druid changes cannot be considered in isolation, especially not against the current healing environment, type of incoming damage and stat system. They could be fair changes or even underpowered and situational come Cataclysm. In addition, Cataclysm will be the expansion of reactive healing not pro-active healing. This is a big blow to the current druid healing model - certainly druids are the most affected due to the ease of pre-hotting - and, in my opinion, a power shift towards preventative healing (priests and to a lesser extent paladins).<br />
<br />
<br />
Shamans have no &quot;Oh Shit&quot; buttons. All their healing spells are very handicapped compared to Druids. By looking at things, Druids &gt; Shamans in raid healing. Even with all the Cataclysm changes taken into consideration. Even if hots cost more mana, the cost be so much they become completely occasional.<br />
<br />
So the conclusion is:<br />
<br />
Druids can tank.<br />
Cat dps &gt; Enha dps.<br />
Boomkin dps &gt; Ele dps<br />
Resto Druids &gt; Resto Shaman.<br />
<br />
Why bring Shaman? Mages have bloodlust now. Until and unless Blizzard ultra buffs every Shaman specc to match every other hybrid's dps/healing. <br />
<br />
My point is, Shamans don't bring anything special to the raid anymore. <br />
<br />
ToW, bought by Lock<br />
Melee haste, bought by DK<br />
Str/Agi buff, bought by DK<br />
Spell hit, bought by S-Priest<br />
<br />
Not sure who brings spell haste (pretty sure someone brings it). <br />
<br />
The only thing bought by Shaman (Resto) is Mana Tide Totem, which is group wide. <br />
<br />
But then every Druid have Innervate, which gives much more mana. <br />
<br />
Plus they have battle ress. <br />
<br />
Not to mention that every Druid also have Tranq. <br />
<br />
All of the above are better baseline raid utility then ANY Shaman specc (even with points spend in a tree) can provide.<br />
<br />
Self Ress? Ye right.<br />
<br />
Shaman raiding comes to an end in Cataclysm??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Single-target tanking was never a failure as a concept. The failure lay in the fact that in the instances when you did need to multi-target tank, you couldn't do it. Remember when Warriors were the only viable tanks and Thunderclap caused no additional threat while having a target limit? That was the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
From Karazan, through BT, SWP, Ulduar, TOC till ICC you need to AOE tank. In BC HCs they still stubborlny insisted to CCs.

As DPS I love it.<br />
<br />
I played a Shaman in TBC as well, and I vividly recall being shunned in heroics. I had to gear up for Kara through PvP. But, again, the problem here lies mostly in how they approached the model. They built heroics around a tool that not every DPS spec had access to. They also went a little overboard. It's fine to require CC of a party at large, but you can't expect it of all three DPS classes or of one specific type (like Priests in Crypts).<br />
<br />
<br />
I predict this &quot;emphasis on CC&quot; will be a fail concpet again and they will shift back to AOE tanking after the first tier of dungeons. To make this shift smoother warrior AOE threat must be looked at like: thunderclap should be a presistent AOE spell like D&amp;D or Concecration OR WW or Cleave in def stance should work like druid's swipe ability.

Most of the people I know that have been around since classic/TBC abhor the WotLK model. It's too easy, requires very little thought, and leaves no room for judgement on the part of either the tank or the DPS. Survivability and longevity are a non-issue on everything except raid bosses and AoE is the answer to everything else.<br />
<br />
AoE tanking and DPS still needs to be an option. It just shouldn't be the only option all the time. CC and single-target DPS make the game more challenging and dynamic, and I know a lot of WoW vets that are craving that, myself included. As a Shaman, I was so happy to get Hex, and now I don't even get to use it outside of PvP.</div></div><hr />

Shaman raiding comes to an end in Cataclysm??<br />
<br />
<br />
So, what you're actually QQ'ing about is the lack of shaman healing/utility versus everyone else come Cataclysm when you won't be the only one bringing an uber-buff to a raid? I doubt Blizzard will go backwards away from &quot;bring the player not the class&quot;. As it stands now it's &quot;bring the player not the class, except shaman 'cos don't be stupid you'll always need one of those&quot;. Well, as you may or may not have noticed, Cataclysm changes are nowhere near being finished, let alone beta'd and PTR-tested. The changes you've seen published are those the devs may be most confident about going into the beta phase but it says nothing about other ideas they may be considering or implementing.<br />
<br />
The shaman previews have stirred up a lot of new interest in the class - you only need to look at the MMO forums, for example. Also, shamans are the class with the most potential changes and new abilities based on the preview notes so far. In short, its a little bit early to be QQing and you should have a bit more confidence in your class or more specific ideas about how the class could be improved - something I'm sure many would be interested in. Simply making shamans==druids is a non-starter, for example.<br />
<br />
Certainly for me, nothing in the preview notes has turned me off my goal of making a mage and shaman alt first thing when Cataclysm hits. Quite the opposite actually.<br />
<br />

It is impossible to make 5m challenging if you or entire party over gear the dungeon by 2+ tiers, unless mobs and bosses hp and damage are scaled with party gear in mind. Especially if stats inflate by so much like in LK. <br />
<br />
On the other hand most frp players despise mob scaling like in Oblivion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's true. But you didn't need to over-gear instances or raids in WotLK in order to AoE pulls. You could do it from square one. People were doing it in heroics with 75-80 quest and instance blues, and they were doing it in Naxx in heroic blues.<br />
<br />
Comparatively, TBC heroics were challenging even in early raid gear. It wasn't until your party started to move beyond T4 that you could start to relax a little.<br />
<br />
Additionally, not everyone was running heroics in T5 during TBC since second-to-last-tier raiding gear wasn't free like it is now. If you wanted to raid in TBC you had to progress. You started at the bottom and worked your way to the top instead of just skipping to the front of the line.</div></div><hr />

Lol what? QQing? Are you even reading what I am writing? How about for once you open your eyes and read properly instead of calling everyone a QQer whenever someone posts something concerning about their class.<br />
<br />
You didn't find anything turning you off regarding Shamans, when you yourself what one AS AN ALT, NOT A MAIN. I play Shaman AS A MAIN. And I am talking about Shaman with AN END GAME prospective, cause that's what I do, play END GAME content, not as an alt that you enjoy from time to time. <br />
<br />
Just by looking at all the changes, any sane person can figure out that Shamans are lacking behind. Just look where Shamans are in WotLK. When it comes to dps, Shamans are the WEAKEST. Both Ele and Enha are the WEAKEST. Blizzard needs to buffs both Ele and Enha greatly. But even after Blizzard buff their dmg, both Ele and Enha are terrible in fights with even a little movement, TERRIBLE. Yes, Sprit Walker's Grace is here to save the day. But how much will it succeed? 10sec duration with 2 mins cooldown. How many casts is that for Ele? 6? <br />
<br />
Look at all the raid utility a Druid can bring. BASELINE UTILITY. Somethings that NO CLASS can bring. I completely agree with Blizzards 'bring the player, not the class' approach. It's the best thing that happened to this game. Every utility is bought by some other class. But what about the utility Druids bring? Why are they not bought by someone else? Shamans bought heroism, and everyone and their entire family QQed about it, Blizzard listened, and took away the uniqueness of the class. And when I say that Druids have the most unique utility, suddenly I am attacked? Lol what? <br />
<br />
Look at the things Druids can bring:<br />
<br />
1)Innervate. Shared by NO other class.<br />
2)Tranquility. Shared by NO other class.<br />
3)Rebirth. Shared by NO other class.<br />
<br />
The MOST important thing. They can play all FOUR SPECCS. The class that has the most unique utility ingame can also play all the speccs ingame. Why isn't Druid utility shared by any other class when every class share their utility? And all the Druid speccs are far better then that of the Shamans. FAR BETTER.<br />
<br />
All the above Druid spells are baseline. NOT EVEN TALENTED. Lets not even talk about Druids talented raid utility. All the Shaman's TALENT UTILITY IS BOUGHT BY OTHER CLASSES. Fair? For every Druid it is, what about other classes? ::) <br />
<br />
Riddle me this. <br />
<br />
Why would someone bring an enha Shaman over Frost DK, who can bring all the enha buffs with a lot more single target and aoe dmg + some CC, or over a cat who can bring innervate, rebirth, tranquility? <br />
<br />
Why would some bring an Ele Shaman over Boomkin, when Boomkin can provide the same utility, not get as much handicapped as Ele in moving fights, bring innervate/CR/Tranquility and do more dps?<br />
<br />
Why would someone bring Resto shaman when Resto Druid can pawn the Resto Shaman healing wise and utility wise? When Druids can do so much more &quot;Oh Shit&quot; healing then Shamans with their tranquility and ToF switch, no matter what the cooldown on it is. Even if it's as high as 3 mins, it's very cool. For 10 man, it will be get a 'Resto Druid and random healer.' Sounds fair to me ::)<br />
<br />
It will be the same way it was at start of WotLK which continued almost half the expansion, where Shamans where the most ridiculous class ingame and need buffs whenever a new patch is coming. It's not fun. Every time your class is lacking behind and you are crying for buffs all the time. <br />
<br />
Do you remember Resto Shamans in Ulduar? I guess not. Shamans where the most ridiculous healers in Ulduar. They were dropped by every end game raiding guild because of their lack of healing and raid utility. It was in 3.2 (TotC) where Blizzard had to massively buff them in order for them to raid properly. Even after those buffs, Resto Shamans lacked behind Druids and Paladins.<br />
<br />
I don't want my class to be uber special with awesome buffs that no one can provide. I never liked the idea, not even in TBC, when everyone was going nuts to reroll/recruit classes because they provided curtain buff. I HATE THE IDEA OF SPECIAL BUFFS GIVEN TO A CLASS. That is why I am asking why Druids STILL have them when no other class does (besides Paladins kings, which is also available as a scroll, weaker, but still there)?<br />
<br />
And how about you talk about to in terms of class utility not some random stuff that you say to some troll who whines about nothing. <br />
<br />
Whatever I am saying are very legit concerns. Concerns about my class from end game prospective. After all the info atm, we are looking at the death of Shaman raiding. <br />
<br />
Yes I KNOW we are not in the PTR yet. But PTR does NOT solve every problem. If it did, Resto Shamans wouldn't have been lacking behind till 3.2 came, BM Hunters wouldn't have been doing 6k dps in naxx, cats wouldn't have been the best single target dps in Ulduar and Ret Paladins wouldn't have been 2 shotting people after the game went live.<br />
<br />
I am not on the US forums. So I can't get a blue answer any of my concerns.<br />
<br />
The problem here (on MMO-C) is that no one really replies on things regarding arenas and stuff :P So I am not getting some solid answers or any proper feedback. I hope I do get some proper feedback rather then some person who DOESN'T even play the class as his/her main.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The class is stirring a lot of interest. But, Stuff on paper =/= Stuff in game. Freezing trap looks awesome on paper, but in game it sucks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Eh, no he said &quot;Maybe you blow Intimidating Shout until Thunder Clap has finished its cooldown.&quot;, keywords being &quot;maybe&quot; and &quot;you&quot;. He didn't say &quot;you should use Intimidating Shout until Thunder Clap has finished its cooldown.&quot;<br />
<br />
Btw, the entire part of the source reads this<br />
<br />
There will almost certainly be staggered adds sometimes. It won't be every encounter. In those situations you'll need to use your full tool box to handle them. Maybe you need to save Thunder Clap for a few seconds. Maybe the rogue and hunter help pull the adds to you. Maybe you Devastate and tab. Maybe you blow Challenging Shout. Maybe you blow Intimidating Shout until Thunder Clap has finished its cooldown. If we wanted you to always have an answer for every single add situation, then Thunder Clap would have no cooldown. That would make tanking easier for sure. Is making tanking easier really more fun? At what point is it so easy that you're just standing there getting beat on?</div></div><hr />

Especially if stats inflate by so much like in LK. <br />
<br />
On the other hand most frp players despise mob scaling like in Oblivion. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think there's a happy medium here. Yeah, base level heroic dungeons will always be an AOE fest late the in expansion. That happened at the end of BC too. I can vividly remember both the careful marking and individual burning of targets in the beginning, and the &quot;oops, I broke CC! LOL!&quot; attitude of the later attempts. Granted it never got as bad as it is now, but gear didn't inflate so much either. <br />
<br />
I think they are looking toward something more like HoR or PoS. In both of these instances we used CC a lot in the first weeks after release, but the need has toned down as people got ICC geared (and it was never entirely necessary for people in mostly ToC gear). The early WotLK dungeons were AOE fests from the beginning. <br />
<br />
I suspect that we will see something in between BC's almost pathological need to organize every pull perfectly, and WotLK's near complete lack of need for organization. CC will be useful, but not always necessary on some pulls.. On other pulls it might be necessary, but not to the degree of a BC pull. Maybe on one pull you all but have to CC, but only one MoB. On another pull there are several MoBs that it would be helpful to CC, but it's not a guaranteed failure if you can't get *all* of them. On a third pull you can just do a WotLK style AOE fest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is where you argue with your guild to bring the player, not the class. ;)<br />
<br />
In regards to the druid questions (I play a feral druid main), yes, they bring innervate, rebirth, and tranquility to the raid. <br />
<br />
What you're forgetting is that ferals, in particular, take a substantial DPS hit for that utility. Want to cast innervate, rebirth or tranquility? Have to pop out of cat form. Not to mention that feral heals are joke - if a raid came down to the point where a cat has to pop tranquility, it's really not looking good anyway. :-\ Good druids know when to use that utility, but it does come at an expense. Not to mention when you're tanking a boss, it's not really a good practice to pop out of bear form often. :P<br />
<br />
Boomkin heals are better in comparison, but they also take a big dps hit in fights with movement. Eclipse procs, fire lands on you, there goes your DPS. :(<br />
<br />
I agree that shaman may need to catch up, but I don't think you should write off your class completely yet. At least in my guild, we'd much rather have a reliable, good player than bring some pug just because they play a druid.</div></div><hr />

Okay your comparing apples and oranges here kid. Druids and shamans are different for a reason. Can a druid come back to life on their own(granted there is a CD but still)? Can druids drop a totem that gives everyone(in their group) roughly 6k to 8k mana? You are just crying cause you cant bring other ppl back from the dead while in combat and cant pop a oh shit healing button. Um healing rain sounds like a cool fucking spell to me.<br />
<br />
Um lets see shamans are necessary in every raid currently. While a feral tank and a boomkin are all that was used for 25 man H LK while resto shamans have been used in every group that killed it so far(havent seen a resto druid in one of those yet cause of the nature of our heals).<br />
<br />
You are failing to put your strengths in here too. If you want to limit this to just utility then hey maybe shamans need something or not considering no other class brings Wrath of air totem.(5% haste is nothing to laugh about) <br />
No other class can give 5 healers 6k+ mana every 5(iirc) minutes. No other class can bring as many buffs as you can in one class. Now every class has its weaknesses. But the death of shaman raiding. pfft ill bring a resto shaman to my raids any day over a holy priest. now thats where you could start talking about some lack of utility. Lets see with 2 resto shamans i get mana tide twices as much.(Which they can still heal while it gives mana back) versus 2 divine hymns and 2 hymn of hopes. Both are channeled and ones takes the priest out of healing for the time. <br />
<br />
The tl;dr version: You have your strengths and weaknesses but thats why there are other classes in the game bud. Cause if shamans were one man healing armies why bring anything else. Cry cause you cant play you toon to its peak ability. It will be okay our resto shamans will continue to wreck shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats not correct, i assure you enhancer can atm keep up with other melees on encounters which require 0 movement.AE dmg is also not that bad,but it requires AP-build.The real reason for low dps is that most of encounters in icc require a lot of movement+ae dmg,and without powerful dots it becomes impossible for enh. to keep up on this; they had already same problems in ToC.Probably Blizz cant fix it just now,because it would overpower enhancer-shamans,but its okay so far, most people got used to it, or just toggled off their recount.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for making valid points rather then coming in writing random stuff. <br />
<br />
I agree with you, Kealdit and Kaynot, to some extent.<br />
<br />
But by looking at both your points, you have to agree that both Enha and Ele need some massive dps buffs to make them compete at end game level. Both the speccs are very poor at movement fights, and I hope Blizzard have some improvements for Cataclysm. Also when it comes to 'phase transition,' Druids mostly use their utility at that time (atleast my guild does), so they don't loose dps/etc.<br />

<br />
Having mana tide totem in Resto specc doesn't over come ALL the raid utility that Druids can bring. 24% mana (group wide) or rebirth/innervate/tranquility (raid wide)/specc buffs. The answer is very obvious when it comes to pure end game raiding. Blizzard said they are trying to make every buff raid wide, so here to hope Mana Tide will be as well. But what about Enha and Ele? You completely forgot to give me a good explanation about that, bud.<br />
<br />
Resto Shaman trumps Resto Druid on LK only. Resto Druid are better healers on almost every other fight. Yogg+1/2/3/4/0 second melee phase, where Resto Druids are mostly used because their heals. Movement fights like PP/FF/FC is where Resto Druids beat Resto Shaman. Fights with constant AOE dmg like Sind, Twins, IC HM is where Resto Druids are better. Anub, where Resto Druids are better again. The entire expac where Resto Druids are better healers does not make up for 1 fight (LK), bud.<br />
<br />
Also my argument was about Druid baseline raid utility vs Shaman baseline raid utility as a whole, not Resto Druid vs Resto Shaman vs Holy Priest. I guess you missed my point, bud.<br />
<br />
As far as the potential of my class goes. I can play all the speccs on my Shaman near perfection. I am currently going for LK25hc with my guild not on one but two characters (different raid groups), Shaman and Hunter. I was promoted to Officer within a month after joining the guild. So, ye, I know how to play my class to it's peak ability, bud. But I guess you again missed my point that I wasn't talking about the current situation but more about Cataclysm, bud.</div></div><hr />

Well, I find it pricey for sure (I can't enter anyway since Blizzard hasn't bothered or hasn't been allowed to organize this for people of my country), but this is something very different from a few pixels. They are seperatedly hosted servers, on top of it being an organized event Blizzard has to take its time for in both preparation, execution as well as well finishing and presenting the result. It's time consuming and this is why tournaments of all kinds require an entry fee.<br />
<br />
Creating a new model for a pet or mount is something entirely different, not only is it creating content players cannot access without paying more than the already steep fee for WoW, but it is also something that requires what, maybe a few afternoons work - less, I'd say, in the case of pets at least - and at the same time blues on Druid forums claim they have no time to update moonkin forms, for example, and that if, as some druid suggested, Blizzard would then just re-use a model for a new boss like they do a lot so they DO have time for the new druid models, the boss models would become overused (like that isn't the case already). At the same time they are releasing a pletora of new models in the shape of paid-for vanity pets and mounts. Now that is taking the piss out of players, if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

I really hope they remove all the AoE, its very boring. It has dumbed down dps ALOT. Seems like most dps classes are just doing 1-2 attacks in most heroics. Everyone forgot LOS, CC, silence pulls. Could be a problem with two must scaling also, when lich came out 3000 dps was pretty good in raids. Now you do 10 000 or more (well not me, but those in the latest tier). Why such huge scaling?<br />

It isn't lack of cc its gear inflation and btw wotlk did have it share of cc in heroics you just dont notice them anymore (like OK and HoL for example)</div></div><hr />

People were doing it in heroics with 75-80 quest and instance blues, and they were doing it in Naxx in heroic blues.<br />
<br />
Comparatively, TBC heroics were challenging even in early raid gear. It wasn't until your party started to move beyond T4 that you could start to relax a little.<br />
<br />
Additionally, not everyone was running heroics in T5 during TBC since second-to-last-tier raiding gear wasn't free like it is now. If you wanted to raid in TBC you had to progress. You started at the bottom and worked your way to the top instead of just skipping to the front of the line.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you must of just done the easy ones. Remember these: 1.Oculus 2.OK 3.HoL 4.UP 5.HoS 6.Gundrak. all those were pretty much avoided especially oculus cuz that instanced traumatized alot of people lol<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned people are blind and keep blaming lack of cc and not notice the real problem</div></div><hr />

It will still not change anything. Going back to the rotation healing ? Be my guest... I thought the goal was to take the game forward. NOT back.<br />
<br />
Here is the thing. Small and fast heals should ALWAYS be the cheap way. But those spells should not be enough to keep ppl ALIVE. This method BLizzard is &quot;inventing&quot; is so naive that its not even funny. Lets remind everyone what the problem is now.... PPL are using their BIG spells cause MANA does not matter ! Why on EARTH should they EVER use the fast expensive small heals AFTER these changes then ? <br />
<br />
It baffles me how naive these guys can be. But hey ... these are the same ppl that designed DeathKnight and Rets in WOTLK. So... We know whats coming.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yep, and they also designed the game you're addicted to. They must be good in some way if you're still here, don't complain that hard.<br />
<br />
Also, it's an expansion that will change the game a lot. Don't assume things are done, a lot of changes are yet to come, and I will be happily awaiting for them! :)</div></div><hr />

Who said I was playing right now ? I said I played from start. I have not much intrest in coming back to the game considering these changes. BLizzard has made some big designing mistakes in WOTLK. Most players could have told them that a 3 tree all in one Death knight would never work. Everyone could have told them that a class with massive burst + healing abilites will dominate PVP.... With the 3 way death knight ofc...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daedalon</div><div class="date">2010-04-20, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that shamans need to get here. They will probably always be the weakest tank healer - and paladin will always be the weakest raid healer. Thats the niche of these classes. But this ofc means that the hot system is pretty much dominating the game atm and Shamans will get their share of it with rain. <br />
<br />
What I think we all agree on - and hopefuly BLizzard does to... Is that the goal is now finally to bring the healer not the class. This ofc is hard cause some of the healing classes have ALL the abilites to heal - while others dont. This is what Blizzard needs to focus on. I think its going to be very hard to balance this so that Druids and Priests will not be dominating - just like they are now. What we can hope for is that it doesn't get any worse. Guilds that use Druid tanks and priests pew pew should also have the resources to cope when it comes to healing.</div></div><hr />

I agree to having some overlapping, but what made classes unique was just that. If you need a druid (because it was a better raid healer) then get one or good luck. They only change spell names, effect and sound and that’s it. <br />
<br />
Why not give tanking abilities to any class, dps to any class and healing to any class… <br />

<br />
Which works great if you're a Druid looking to raid. If you want to raid as any of the other three healing classes, or if 9-24 other people need that one Restoration-specced Druid to show up before their raid can get off the ground... Not so much.</div></div><hr />

I have to say, I really just don't agree with this viewpoint, &quot;you can't complain now! everything's going to be different in Cataclysm and it'll all be fine!&quot;<br />
<br />
I just see it as blind, baseless optimism that blizzard won't screw things up with changes they're making when those changes just don't make sense. This is the same design crew that's done all kinds of dumb things before and then had to spend patch after patch dealing with all the fallout of fixing something that was just a bad idea to begin with. <br />
<br />
If the initial concept of shit just doesn't make sense, it won't magically start making sense after everything else has been designed. That's why people should bitch if something doesn't make sense. Granted, it doesn't have much effect here, but how many times has blizzard said &quot;working as intended&quot; then after pages and pages of QQ on the official forums decided to hotfix it because they realized they did something retarded.</div></div><hr />

It is pretty baseless to assume something won't work when we can't see most of the mechanism yet, although it is equally baseless to assume it will. Ultimately, it's the waiting game. And patience is really one of the many virtues of the human race. :)</div></div><hr />

Personally, I don't believe it will turn out the way I want it to be. I just don't like how people seem to know how a class will be in Cataclysm based on how they are being played currently in Wrath. Granted, they aren't changing so dramatically that they're a husk of their former selves. And about a concept not making sense, it's simply because it hasn't been thoroughly tested or even used by the vast majority.</div></div><hr />

In Cataclysm, there will be more threat to the tank of dying if you try to just AE tank every pull. Likewise, AE damage won't be quite as awesome so that single targeting things will probably be a better strategy when there are say 3-5 adds. If it's a dozen twilight whelps, then sure, AE away.

<br />
The idea is to replicate the fun and challenge of the model without all of the problems that accompanied it. Namely:<br />
<br />
1. Requiring too much CC. Needing one or two party members to CC is fine. Requiring all three DPS to CC, or one specific type of CC starts to strain the party.<br />
<br />
2. Excluding specs that can't CC. This should be much less of a problem now than it used to be. Current forms of CC are less restricted than they used to be (Sap affecting all targets, Entangling Roots being cast indoors), and most classes, including hybrids, have some form of CC now (Hex, Repentence). Fixing Problem 1 will also help to alleviate this problem, as those specs without CC will have an easier time getting into groups if it's not required of one or two of the DPS.</div></div><hr />

I enjoyed CC ten times more then brainless AoE every singel herioc. Had to use more then 1 button is fun you know, maybe not for you though. And hybrids wasnt shit it was the player and group that was shit if they didnt made it, or they just wanted fast gear. Gear addiction will bring this game down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, it was extremely annoying when you ran it with shit players, but that isnt a instance design problem. Shit players are shit players and they shouldn't be facerolling heroics.<br />
<br />
Take shadow labyrinth, shattered halls, etc, reduce trash amount and instance size by 50%, remove instant-deaths and you have a winner.</div></div><hr />
