WoW Turns 7! Anniversary Tabard now available in-game<br />
World of Warcraft turns 7 this year (see World of Warcraft’s Seventh Anniversary! (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2558-World-of-Warcraft%E2%80%99s-Seventh-Anniversary-New-WoW-TV-Spot) and to celebrate, players will be awarded a tabard and the WoW's 7th Anniversary (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5863/wows-7th-anniversary/) Feat of Strength. The celebration lasts from November 20 to December 3, this is a visual tabard and it will not unequip your current tabard. <br />
<br />
Update - I just realized that the &quot;Celebration Package&quot; item summoning the tabard requires the 7th anniversary event to be active, it most likely means that this item will expire. Might want to wait for a blue confirmation on that before you go through all your alts to get it.<br />

<br />
The item WoW's 7th Anniversary 10 sec cooldown Increases Experience and Reputation gains from kills by 7% for 1 hour. <br />
<br />
The buff can be reapplied and the item that gives the buff will last until the 3rd December. The item only has a 10 sec cooldown and also shoots a firework every time you use it :) <br />

It might not just be you but your interpretation is wrong. They are talking about Deathwing and the Cataclysm that happened to the WORLD of azeroth. There is nothing about the sentences that implies subscription drops or &quot;WoW is dying&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I think its mostly that it feels they just don't care anymore. Baby blizzard bear. Ony Whelp. Then nothing. Now a tabard that might be temporary (and reuses a graphic (really ugly one, no less) so theres a bit of half-assedness there). Mostly I laughed when I saw it, because I was going to resub and get my wife to resub too. Now I won't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
... Are you kidding me? Seriously? The fact that you chose to blatantly take it out of context and leave out the first part of the sentence doesn't make it go away; &quot;With the return of a certain very large dragon, this has been a rough year for the world of Azeroth&quot;. It specifically refers to in-game lore events and has nothing to do with subscription numbers whatsoever. Holy WoW-bashing conspiracy nuts, Batman! Only on mmo-champ -.-<br />
<br />
On topic though, the reward seems rather lackluster. I mean, not only is it limited duration, it's also a reused model? It won't even leave us with a permanent memory or souvenir for being around at this time? Then what's the point of it? :S Well sure, I suppose it's a step up from last year's &quot;no anniversary pet this time, but let's shamelessly release not one but two store pets simultaneously with the anniversary, DERP&quot;, but only by a neglegible margin.</div></div><hr />

No, you pay the subscription for the game at 15 bucks a month, genius. Worst argument ever.</div></div><hr />

It was, but have you looked at the amount of people that actually managed to get the original tabard? A VERY small amount of people, hell I wonder if any of them still even play.<br />

I hardly think it's going to be a huge problem.<br />

<br />
Hmmm, let me see if I can break this down so you can understand it a little better. <br />
1 I am posting on a gaming forum, not writing for the local news. I really don't care about the grammar being perfect. <br />
<br />
2 I am a warrior, so I run on rage. Therefor less is not better. ;p<br />
<br />
3 I am a bit overgrown, or so my wife tells me atleast. But hey it is the holiday season and this time of year my ft pants just become my pants.<br />
<br />
4 If someone who has been playing since vanilla wow,( but also understand that the game will not last forever) so I enjoy the content that they put out for me and my family to play is what you consider a FANBOY, (whew, I almost had a grammar lapse there.) Then yes I guess you could say I am one.<br />
<br />
and Number 5. I'm not real sure of your intent for the word manchild, so I just broke it down again. Yes I am a man, and yes I do have children and grandchildren even. So I guess you got me right on that one too. <br />
<br />

<br />
And by that standard, they did well. As they actually released an item for free, for all players.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
It's a broken mentality held by many: the feeling that there is an obligation to give out gifts. That, however, is contrary to the spirit of gift-giving. No one is obligated to give anything to anyone, when a gift is given, it needs to be done as an act of thoughtfulness which can be expressed in many other ways other than the giving of physical or digital goods. There've been years where I didn't get anything for Christmas -- no one I knew was obligated to give me anything, and they didn't... which was fine by me. I don't need to be constantly placated by commercial junk to be reminded that my family and friends care for me, as I got to spend that Holliday sharing food, music and having a great time actually talking and laughing with people instead of fretting over some new complicated gizmo.<br />
<br />
And on that note, you know how I know Blizzard cares about its players?<br />
<br />
I reported someone who had named themselves &quot;Jewpwner&quot; the other day. Two hours later, I got a ticket response with a GM talking to me directly, apologizing that the person even was allowed to even make that name. For three days, I didn't see that person (with his new name) at all in Stormwind. <br />
<br />
I then proceeded to see him cry and cry and cry in Trade chat about how WoW was dying and hates its customers and never gives us free stuff anymore, ect, and that he was going to go play SWTOR instead.<br />
<br />
So, you know, I tend to not really have much pity for those who act like they've been tremendously betrayed each time their whims are not anticipated and catered to PRECISELY by ANY game company. Blizzard is too busy making a game to play nursemaid to entitled brats.... and if you take off to a different game? Fine. Bioware, EA, Arenanet, Sony, or any other company does not actively hire mind-readers either. Have fun realizing that no game is ever going to give you a digital blowjob to reward you for being subscribed for 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not a tabard. <br />
It's a buff that makes you look like you are wearing one. <br />
It will last 14 days and then you cannot use it anymore. ever. <br />
Leave it to Blizzard tho to leave the item in our bags to clutter up space. <br />
<br />
2) <br />
<br />
7% ? That's not even decent. <br />
We have a stack of items already in game that gives you the ability to get 10% here and 5% there. <br />
For an item that will only last a measly 14 days and is to celebrate wow's 7th, it's just not good enough. Make it 50% and people would rejoice. <br />
But no, it has to be 7, because it's their 7th Anniversary ? Play less on words and numbers Blizzard and give us a &quot;real&quot; gift. <br />
<br />
<br />
3) Yes we got &quot;something&quot; for &quot;free&quot;, But this something is more a slap in the face than a gift. it would have been better if they just gave us nothing, or a pack of fireworks imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard should celebrate US THE LOYAL PAYING PLAYER!!!<br />
<br />
But as someone else said, why give away something when you can sell it for 10 bucks, id love to know what Blizzard made off those $10 dollar pets. So once again the paying player signs their annual pass, and buys their $10 pet prolly netting them ungodly amounts of cash, and we get a pointless illusion item...<br />

How many times do we gota say, blizzard is NOT alive, it is not a living creature that has lived 7 years, its a BUSINESS that WE THE PLAYERS have given god like status through the MILLIONS AND MILLIONS of dollars PROFIT we GIVE THEM EVERY MONTH!<br />
<br />
Blizzard should celebrate US THE LOYAL PAYING PLAYER!!!<br />
<br />
But as someone else said, why give away something when you can sell it for 10 bucks, id love to know what Blizzard made off those $10 dollar pets. So once again the paying player signs their annual pass, and buys their $10 pet prolly netting them ungodly amounts of cash, and we get a pointless illusion item...<br />
<br />
I got 8 85's Blizzard, thanks!!!<br />
<br />
You know, you wouldn't have given Blizzard all that money if they haven't invested the time and energy into making a game that's worth paying for month after month. So why exactly are they obliged to owe you anything when they are the ones who are doing all the actual work? You know, like server maintnence and upkeep, development for new content, additional features, new games etc.</div></div><hr />

Wheres my pet?!?! =( <br />
I want mah pet &gt;.&gt; <br />
Otherwise a kinda lame item. Would have been nicer with another pet :P <br />

What I'm not happy about is that it is becoming apparant that SWTOR is going to be swamped with a load of whiney little kids, judging by a lot of the comments on this thread. A shame they can't go somewhere else. Ah well, no avoiding them in any game these days, I guess.</div></div><hr />

I have to give credit to Blizzard for having completely turned the customer/service provider relationship on its head.<br />
<br />
In most businesses, you strive to find new ways to attract customers and keep them happy with your product. You try and make your customers feel warm and valued by your business. You try and offer value and new exciting things. Why? Because then they will continue to buy your product, and won't leave to go to your competitors. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has achieved the feat of having part of its customer base argue, on its behalf, that it doesn't actually owe anything to its customers. Whilst this is of course true, the subscription agreement doesn't &quot;entitle&quot; us to anything, I find it baffling that paying customers argue so strongly in favor of not being entitled to anything. &quot;Just be happy you're getting anything&quot; is a bizarre attitude to take in my opinion, are you so enthralled to Blizzard that you gratefully accept whatever rubbish they serve up? I really can't think of any other company where the customers would defend the right to receive so little.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am slightly surprised that they didn't make more of an effort, you would think 800k subscribers in 3 months would get them in gear. Again, it just doesn't make good business sense to me, all they had to do was reskin an existing pet and it would have earned them some fairly easy goodwill from the players.</div></div><hr />

Valid point, yes. But what you seem to forget is that there are A LOT of people that are actually happy with this gift. Some of them will ofcourse react to the screaming hordes bashing Blizz at ALL TIMES. And you don't really have to be a brainwashed follower of the evil cult of Blizzard just because you get tired of the endless whinetrain.<br />

Heirlooms already give like what, 40% bonus xp including the ring? How much more you want, people are already bored with too many 85s cause lvling is such a joke.</div></div><hr />

I did some calculations on it. Lets say you are revered to Tol barad and want to get exalted now on anniversary.You get about 6050 rep per day as a human from dailies according to wowhead. 6050 x 1.07 = 6473,5 -&gt;about 6474 rep per day. It only gives measly 420 or so more rep and still takes the same 3 days to do it 21000 / 6474 = 3,47 days when without buff its 3,24 days. Conclusion : for rep grinding anniversary buff is useless but might have some merit if used for leveling alts coupled with rested bonus in full power. One could get some annoying lvling phase over faster, if you are tight on schedule and every saved hour of playing counts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In most businesses, you strive to find new ways to attract customers and keep them happy with your product. You try and make your customers feel warm and valued by your business. You try and offer value and new exciting things. Why? Because then they will continue to buy your product, and won't leave to go to your competitors. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has achieved the feat of having part of its customer base argue, on its behalf, that it doesn't actually owe anything to its customers. Whilst this is of course true, the subscription agreement doesn't &quot;entitle&quot; us to anything, I find it baffling that paying customers argue so strongly in favor of not being entitled to anything. &quot;Just be happy you're getting anything&quot; is a bizarre attitude to take in my opinion, are you so enthralled to Blizzard that you gratefully accept whatever rubbish they serve up? I really can't think of any other company where the customers would defend the right to receive so little.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am slightly surprised that they didn't make more of an effort, you would think 800k subscribers in 3 months would get them in gear. Again, it just doesn't make good business sense to me, all they had to do was reskin an existing pet and it would have earned them some fairly easy goodwill from the players.<br />
<br />

<br />
What I'm not happy about is that it is becoming apparant that SWTOR is going to be swamped with a load of whiney little kids, judging by a lot of the comments on this thread. A shame they can't go somewhere else. Ah well, no avoiding them in any game these days, I guess.<br />
<br />
Yeah,<br />
<br />
A bunch of them went to Rift, and now a bunch of them are going to SWTOR... and we still seem to have a bunch of them staying with WoW. Or at least, staying on MMO Champ to complain about WoW. :)<br />
<br />
So I agree: there seems to be no avoiding them these days.<br />
<br />
I don't have a pre-order, but got a Beta key from Curse, and am looking forward to seeing for myself what SWTOR is like.<br />
<br />
But I also signed-up for the 1-year subscription to WoW, so people can still feel free to call me a fanboi... cause that just cuts me to the quick. [not!]</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kinda agree its lame to give it away, but what they haven't gave away so far? Even the Scarab Lord mount can be earned now just by grinding. Thats part of the problem with the game atm, back in Classic and BC dedicated people were allowed to have rare and epic rewards to stand out, now they just give everything away in a way or the other. And its not like i have anything like Scarab Lord or whatever, its just lame for the people that do.</div></div><hr />

Strongly disagree.<br />
<br />
Nothing would say &quot;We're just phoning it in...&quot; more than a re-skin of an existing pet.<br />
<br />
Giving an annual pet was one of the biggest mistakes Blizz made, because it caused two problems:<br />
<br />
1. A sense of entitlement, in which players expect a new, &quot;better&quot; pet each year.<br />
2. Since everyone gets the pet, no one uses it because it isn't &quot;special&quot; or &quot;unique&quot;.<br />
<br />
How many Baby Blizzard Bears or Mr Chilly pets do you see?<br />
<br />
How many other dime-a-dozen pets do you see people using?<br />
<br />
Other than the Onyxia whelpling - which blows a smoke-ring - I can't think of any Blizz-gave-one-to-everybody pets that I've seen people using after the event has passed.<br />
<br />
Granted, some people do use the &quot;collector's edition&quot; and/or Blizzcon pets, but those aren't something everyone has, are they? And they are having the same problem of coming-up with a &quot;killer&quot; pet each year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really shows the state of the game when people are worried about pets more than that because they've given up hope of seeing a quality patch ever again.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard is just a victim of it's own success. They put out some really fucking sweet Patches/Content over the years and that same quality hasn't gone down at all. We've just become USED to it that it feels lackluster, so Blizzard NOW has to work 2-3x as hard to put out Content/Patches that have the same &quot;WOW(non acronym) effect!&quot; that their predecessors have given. <br />
<br />

Thats $15.00 in their pockets and even if those people stay for only one month, its more then what people would pay for a pet at the blizzard store. But instead they give a temp rep/xp ugly tabard that only increases your rep/xp gain marginally I used to get 12-13 rep from a mob now I get 17-18 rep.. not a huge increase, something that may have been a reason why its only temporary, but 7% is pretty much useless. They will happily put a guardian cub for people to pay $10.00 for a one time use, not a BoA, even if people can sell it. But instead of thinking that they could give a free mini pet for people that may give them an icrease in subscribers and please the customers they give this. Call it greedy, call it whatever but if you think how much money they make from subscribers, tcg, and the blizzard store I am sure they could afford to keep the customers happy even if it is just one month.</div></div><hr />

I rechecked as I had assumed it was only a week. The start and end times seem to depend on server. On Azjol-Nerub it says 2AM but on Undermine it has 3AM start and end times.

Funny that though, when you go to a Birthday party, you usually haven't been paying for that party for the last year.<br />
<br />
We are paying customers, and in this tough economic climate when people are trying to justify expenditure, especially on something such as a game, then Blizzard should be pulling out ALL the stops to keep its client base. Even more so with 2 major IPs coming shortly to contend with. We have a RIGHT to expect great service, and a great product. This isn't like grocery shopping whereby you need it to survive, we are paying for this because we *want* to, and thus they should be kissing our proverbial asses and thankful we have chosen to spend our money on the game for this long, allowing it to get to its 7th birthday. Something all the defenders of this pile of crap seem to be forgetting. <br />
<br />
But instead, they give..this..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hardly think this was one of their &quot;biggest mistakes&quot;. That's over exaggerating slightly. No one feels entitled. And I don't think they ever felt pressured to make &quot;better&quot; pets. There are no &quot;better&quot; pets, only different ones. No one likes re-skins.<br />
<br />
I don't know why they stopped giving pets for the anniversary events but if I were to take a completely unfounded guess it would be because there is no profit in it.<br />
<br />
P.S. I use Baby Blizzard Bear ALL the time, and the penguin on my gnome characters even though I have many more less used/rare ones. They're no more or less used than any other pets as far as I've seen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EVERY year, there is something about the anniversary, its pretty obvious the majority of the player-base likes it. Last year, they had a lot of moaning about no gift or pet, and said they took it on board etc. This year, they have done far less than people would have expected.<br />
Now, there is only 3 possible reasons for this-<br />
<br />
1) They are so busy working on new product, they simply didn't have time.<br />
2) They have massively misjudged the community in terms of what they want (this is VERY bad when your in service industry)<br />
3) They are so wrapped up in their own hubris, or just don't give a toss anymore. (VERY bad as well.)<br />
<br />
Now, I am hoping it is one, but I am sadly beginning to think it is either 2, or 3. There is no point saying this doesn't matter, and its only a game etc. This is a prime example of how badly Blizzard misjudges things and get's it wrong so fundamentally from my perspective.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather Blizzard have not bothered. Oh well, it couldn't have taken 1 programmer more than a few minutes to cobble together, so it's not like Blizz wasted much time on it. You'd think Blizzard would have been more fired up about WoW's 7th Anniversary, but I guess working on an MMO for 7 years has just burned them out.</div></div><hr />

Wrong. They are not mutually exclusive. <br />
<br />
When will you hard-headed and stubborn children get the clue that they have *teams*? Teams! Some teams work on things, some work on others. No TEAM is required to make the stupid tabard this year. One single programmer may have done it. It is the mark of a child with little scope in the world to not understand when things are not mutually exclusive.</div></div><hr />

A screenshot I've taken a year ago, at 30.11.2010, of the letter they sent when the 6th anniversary came to the game.<br />
<br />
If to go line by line, they've added a word &quot;yet&quot;, removed &quot;(spoiler alert!)&quot; and changed &quot;this is going to be a rough year&quot; to &quot;this has been a rough year&quot;. Well.. basically, a copy/past, added an item that applies a minor buff and a visible, not even a physical, rehashed tabard which was used in their contest back in 2005.<br />
<br />
A thought comes to mind.. a developer(s) who get the job to do this year's anniversary for players scratches his head, clueless and indifferent to the emotional part of the whole matter, looks at the 6-year old tabard that wasn't used for a long time, and decides to rehash it. Least possible effort in work done - same money.<br />
<br />
And then we're talking about care and dedication to the true fans of this universe, of their passion, to their players who were with them, supporting them and their ideas for a very long time... indifference, cold, grey and bitter.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, not too overwhelmed by the gift itself. It's nice for my rep grind, but that's about it. Don't want a new pet either, since it will be a cheap made one anyway. And it's a hell of a lot better than last years &quot;gift&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also I can see why they didn't give a pet or anything, cuz they're trying to make stuff disappear less often from the game. Joining a game for the first time only to find out half the cool stuff isn't available anymore always sucks for new players. No need to be like Cartman who expects to get big gifts at someone ELSE's birthday party.<br />
<br />
I also laugh at people saying &quot;oh they gave us crap instead of new models or balanced pvp&quot;, what did you expect they'd release a huge secret patch just for the 7th anniversary? <br />
<br />
And if they WOULD have made something like a new tabard or pet, wouldn't people have cried just as much that they were wasting time on new tabards instead of new models and content and balance?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kihlerabz</div><div class="date">2011-11-21, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest issue I can see is just how badly Blizzard misjudge this stuff.<br />
<br />
EVERY year, there is something about the anniversary, its pretty obvious the majority of the player-base likes it. Last year, they had a lot of moaning about no gift or pet, and said they took it on board etc. This year, they have done far less than people would have expected.<br />
Now, there is only 3 possible reasons for this-<br />
<br />
1) They are so busy working on new product, they simply didn't have time.<br />
2) They have massively misjudged the community in terms of what they want (this is VERY bad when your in service industry)<br />
3) They are so wrapped up in their own hubris, or just don't give a toss anymore. (VERY bad as well.)<br />
<br />
Now, I am hoping it is one, but I am sadly beginning to think it is either 2, or 3. There is no point saying this doesn't matter, and its only a game etc. This is a prime example of how badly Blizzard misjudges things and get's it wrong so fundamentally from my perspective.<br />
<br />
I'm in agreement with the spirit of Howlrunner's post. I find it more interesting to muse about Blizz's motive, thinking or rationale for chosing this (gift/reward, what-have-you) than passing judgement as to whether it's lame or not.<br />
<br />
As far as the &quot;entitlement&quot; attitude some have expressed . . . I guess if it was only fireworks each year there'd be a corresponding ho-hum response each year as well, but they went a little extra in some years so naturally by doing so have set themselves up for dissappointing responses when they don't &quot;outdo&quot; (or roughly equal) previous years. But where does it end in trying to &quot;outdo&quot; themselves? Maybe the analogy is not perfect but does every Christmas, Birthday or Anniversary have to be bigger and better than the one before it? Of course it depends on the milestone achieved: a persons 100thbirthday is pretty special and there are Silver, Golden and Diamond Anniversaries. So for Blizz's WoW it's year seven. To some the 'thank-you-for-you-loyalty-and-support' celebratory token of appreciation is underwhelming. But the anology is not perfect in that this is a not a real-life person to person gift-giving situation, it's a company to consumer situation. The company has to continually strive to please the customer with their product or service. <br />
<br />
Which brings me to the 3 possible reasons Howlrunner mentioned. I don't think it's reason number 1 -- it's hard to believe a company as big and well funded as Blizz is (i.e. monthly raking in fees from subscriber's numbering into the multi-millions) could not afford to hire for or allocate a tiny portion of their resources to come up with something more unique for the occasion or even simply to create a new pet model. And I don't think it's reason number 3 -- that they blatently don't care since I don't get the impression that they aren't making at least a good-faith effort in tyring to improve the gamel. But that's of course subjective. From what I've read some seem to feel they haven't done anything right for a long time (yet they are still investing time enough in the game to be able to express a negative opinion about changes over time). I would put my money on number 2 -- massive misjudgement of the what the WoW community wants or put another way, misjudging what would delight more veteran players. I think the newer players will probably wonder what the fuss is all about and accept the gift simply for what it is. Whereas I can certainly see how this is pretty underwhelming a token off appreciation for loyal, long-playing (and therefore long-paying) customers.<br />
<br />
If the game lasts that long, it will be interesting to see what they do for the 10th anniversary. Perhaps they will try to really impress their customers with fireworks, a pet and a exp/rep buff dissappearing tabard?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even though I agree with the technicality and obviousness (and therefore sillyness) of the observation that &quot;it's not in the TOS that we get anything from Blizz for their anniversaries&quot; I find this McDonald burger analogy incredibly amusing and illuminating to the subject at hand.<br />

Blizzard is in fact obliged to give us things. We bought their game and we're paying for it monthly, not mentioning other services that bring them money. And we are the ones keeping WoW alive so yeah, it's Blizzard who should be grateful that there are people playing their game. Now don't tell me that Blizzard couldn't take some little more time and design something more interesting that a tabard, I'm not complaining that it's bad because honestly I don't care but I can imagine that it would make quite a few people surprised and/or happy if they would give out some little vanity item with some interesting cool on use effect or whatever, they have all the means to do it and it's not hard for company like Blizzard. By the way people will always find something to complain about, no matter what.<br />
<br />
So people that realise the value of gifts and actually are grateful when they receive one are called fanboys, just because you think your own opinion will look more important and cool then… wow, just wow.<br />
What has fanboyism got anything to do with being grateful when you get something?<br />
<br />
So you say you are not complaining, and don’t care, but at the same time you think blizzard is obliged to give us something and that you expected something more. You just contradict yourself there, you know.<br />
<br />
As for people not resubbing, or pre-ordering SWTOR just because this tabard I have one word: pathetic. <br />
Please go away, play other games and come to the realisation that these other games don’t give you anything for free either. And maybe you can then grow up and realise some of the values of life: be grateful for what you get, how small it may be.<br />
<br />
It is a game and you are not forced to play it. <br />
<br />
OT: as a pet collector, I would have loved it if they had added a anniversary pet, but now that is not the case, I am not ungrateful. <br />
Will I make much use of the anniversary gift? I don’t think I will, I rarely level alts, don’t do battle grounds much, and most factions are on exalted already. <br />
I might make some use of it to rep grind the steamwheedle cartel factions (which are not on exalted yet) but I don’t think it will be of huge importance. <br />
Will I wear a tabard if it would stay in game? I don’t think so, I normally don’t wear a tabard. <br />
But do I whine about its color, about the fact that is ‘a meager 7%’, or that ‘its effect only lasts for 2 weeks’ or that it doesn’t have my name on it? No, I take it and say thank you, just like any normal person with some knowledge in life would do, just like someone which is not a spoiled brat would do.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the wall of text, but this whining is just annoying.<br />

<br />
Strongly disagree.<br />
<br />
Nothing would say &quot;We're just phoning it in...&quot; more than a re-skin of an existing pet.<br />
<br />
Giving an annual pet was one of the biggest mistakes Blizz made, because it caused two problems:<br />
<br />
1. A sense of entitlement, in which players expect a new, &quot;better&quot; pet each year.<br />
2. Since everyone gets the pet, no one uses it because it isn't &quot;special&quot; or &quot;unique&quot;.<br />
<br />
How many Baby Blizzard Bears or Mr Chilly pets do you see?<br />
<br />
How many other dime-a-dozen pets do you see people using?<br />
<br />
Other than the Onyxia whelpling - which blows a smoke-ring - I can't think of any Blizz-gave-one-to-everybody pets that I've seen people using after the event has passed.<br />
<br />
Granted, some people do use the &quot;collector's edition&quot; and/or Blizzcon pets, but those aren't something everyone has, are they? And they are having the same problem of coming-up with a &quot;killer&quot; pet each year.<br />
<br />
While I agree on the things you pointed out, there are some things I’d like to add:<br />
<br />
You don’t see that many vanity pets being used because most of the people that use them a lot are pet collectors, which often run around with the more rare pets they have, or, like me, with any other random pet.<br />
On the other hand you can say that 90% (give or take, just to say it is the majority) of the vanity pets are basically ‘give-to-everybody’ pets, since you can buy them for very little money, and everybody has got access to them. There are actually only a handful of pets you have to do some effort for. (and for most of those, even then, the effort is still small)<br />
<br />
I have a macro that brings up a random one of my pets, so the chance that it is the baby blizzard bear (4th anniversary)or the penguin (battle.net) is not too high, but it doesn’t mean they are ugly.<br />
(and if they are, just don’t use them, simple as that)<br />
I do have the corehound pup(authenticator) and the onyxian whelpling (5th anniversary) on my bars separately though, just because they are very cute, and these 2 are more likely to be seen around my side, as these pets are more likely to be summoned.<br />

McDonalds serves you a dry, old cheeseburger that's been laying around for a week. McDonalds fan boy says &quot;You're lucky they served you anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
Can you give an even worse example? <br />
See it more like this: <br />
You are going to macdonalds for a meal, and they give your kid a toy to play with. What do you Say? <br />
<br />
1. <br />
Hey I expected a playstation, because I come here to this restaurant for the last 7 years. This toy is useless, as it will last for only a few weeks… (which is true btw, those toys are mostly not that good of quality, but whatever)<br />
<br />
Or 2.<br />
Here boy (or girl, whatever you child’s sex is), these nice people give you something to play with, what do you say to the nice mister? And then the toddler says ‘thank you,sir’.<br />
<br />
I can assure you, since I have kids, I will definitely try to teach them the second answer.<br />
And so should every grown up do.</div></div><hr />

If i want to read trolls, i want them to be adult and intelligent and thought provoking (4chan/reddit/digg/fark).<br />
<br />
So maybe in a couple of years most of the trolls will have graduated to more mature forums where they will meet real opponents, then this forum will be worth reading again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Howlrunner</div><div class="date">2011-11-21, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in agreement with the spirit of Howlrunner's post. I find it more interesting to muse about Blizz's motive, thinking or rationale for chosing this (gift/reward, what-have-you) than passing judgement as to whether it's lame or not.<br />
<br />
As far as the &quot;entitlement&quot; attitude some have expressed . . . I guess if it was only fireworks each year there'd be a corresponding ho-hum response each year as well, but they went a little extra in some years so naturally by doing so have set themselves up for dissappointing responses when they don't &quot;outdo&quot; (or roughly equal) previous years. But where does it end in trying to &quot;outdo&quot; themselves? Maybe the analogy is not perfect but does every Christmas, Birthday or Anniversary have to be bigger and better than the one before it? Of course it depends on the milestone achieved: a persons 100thbirthday is pretty special and there are Silver, Golden and Diamond Anniversaries. So for Blizz's WoW it's year seven. To some the 'thank-you-for-you-loyalty-and-support' celebratory token of appreciation is underwhelming. But the anology is not perfect in that this is a not a real-life person to person gift-giving situation, it's a company to consumer situation. The company has to continually strive to please the customer with their product or service. <br />
<br />
Which brings me to the 3 possible reasons Howlrunner mentioned. I don't think it's reason number 1 -- it's hard to believe a company as big and well funded as Blizz is (i.e. monthly raking in fees from subscriber's numbering into the multi-millions) could not afford to hire for or allocate a tiny portion of their resources to come up with something more unique for the occasion or even simply to create a new pet model. And I don't think it's reason number 3 -- that they blatently don't care since I don't get the impression that they aren't making at least a good-faith effort in tyring to improve the gamel. But that's of course subjective. From what I've read some seem to feel they haven't done anything right for a long time (yet they are still investing time enough in the game to be able to express a negative opinion about changes over time). I would put my money on number 2 -- massive misjudgement of the what the WoW community wants or put another way, misjudging what would delight more veteran players. I think the newer players will probably wonder what the fuss is all about and accept the gift simply for what it is. Whereas I can certainly see how this is pretty underwhelming a token off appreciation for loyal, long-playing (and therefore long-paying) customers.<br />
<br />
If the game lasts that long, it will be interesting to see what they do for the 10th anniversary. Perhaps they will try to really impress their customers with fireworks, a pet and a exp/rep buff dissappearing tabard?<br />
<br />
This is what I mean. I personally don't really give two hoots about the event, but its shocking to see a company like Blizzard that used to get so many things right, suddenly start to get it wrong.<br />
Over the past couple of years, they have misjudged the community immensely, and I don't mean just whiners and haters so to speak. Look at the Real ID forum debacle, and the massive outcry it caused. Now, lets look at the gamut of micro transactions that are now creeping in, along with a feeling of &quot;Pay to Win&quot; from some players. Years ago, we would have scoffed at them had anyone even suggested Blizzard would make a pet tradeable in game for money, yet it is now here. Whilst these things again don't bother me par se, they *DO* bother a lot of people, and Blizzard has seemed to not grasp the scale of the mess they have caused, and how deeply it is affecting the customer base they have.<br />
As someone else said, this is only a small thing, but it is just one of many MANY things that are slowly occurring that are angering players, and this for many, may just be the proverbial straw t hat makes them go &quot;Know what? I have had enough, I quit&quot;.<br />
<br />
I will be honest, I used to think the people saying Activision will ruin Blizzard were just tin foil hat wearing monkeys, but I am starting to get a small doubt they may actually be right...:S</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find it laughable that anyone would get so worked up over this that it would be the tipping point to make them quit but maybe I'm just being insensitive. I guess I haven't played the game long enough (started about 3/4 of way into BC) or play for different reasons and therefore not percieving the other gross miss-steps they have made. I really appreciated things like the introduction of heirlooms, dual-talenting, lowering riding skill levels (questing in STV on foot was grueling lol), dungeon finder, to name a few. <br />
<br />
But I definitely agree about the Pet Store thing. They prohibit gold buying and gold selling and stress such activities are against the TOS and those caught doing so may be suspended or banned. The message to me behind that policy is they don't want the game economy distorted by real-life money influence. Fair enough . . . I like to feel that I'm competing on a level playing field economically with other players. Real world money should have no bearing on the game economy. Then they instroduce tradeable/saleable pets not achieved in-game but bought with real life money. Quoting from the Blizz Pet Store FAQ: &quot; . . . we're ok with it if some players choose to use the Guardian Cub as a safe and secure way to try to acquire a little extra in-game gold . . . &quot; On the one had it's against TOS to buy game gold with real money, then they turn around and sell for real money an in-game item a player can sell for game gold. Can they really expect to continue a zero-tolerance policy against gold selling without being accused of hypocrisy?</div></div><hr />

Make me you moron... Just because people don't agree with your opinion doesn't mean we have to leave. <br />
<br />
WoW will be nearly dead in 2012 and in 2013 half the players will be moved to Guild Wars 2 or Star Wars TOR. So suck it up, your game is dying and you can't do shit about it.<br />
<br />
And no I am no hater. I did love this game since it was released, but some people must learn to &quot;let go&quot;.</div></div><hr />
