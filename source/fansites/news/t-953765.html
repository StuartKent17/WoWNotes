Tier 11 Shoulders and Head for Justice Points<br />
As of this moment, there aren't any plans to make those items available for Justice Points.<br />
<br />
That doesn't necessarily mean that those items are still out of reach, though. We re-tuned the tier 11 raid instances in the hopes that players who haven't seen that content might be willing to give them a shot. If you don't have a group of friends or guild mates that are interested in trying out those raids, the Raid Browser is an under-used tool that can be convenient for getting a raid group started, or for filling the gaps in your raid composition.<br />
<br />
(For those who are unaware, the Raid Browser is available as a menu button at the bottom of your interface titled 'Raid') (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/189785/t11-helms-and-shoulders-for-jp) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2973389003?page=7#127))<br />

Why does Blizzcon exist? Can't Blizzard just attend E3?<br />
E3 is an expo primarily geared toward employees and press in the gaming industry. BlizzCon is a convention we host ourselves for our Blizzard gaming communities. In order to make sure it's packed full of cool stuff, we need to make sure it roughly pays for itself.<br />
<br />
The size, scope, and purpose of BlizzCon is so different from E3 that there's no meaningful way to compare the two. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/189803/blizzcon) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2973009445?page=1#8))<br />
<br />
Hiring Game Masters<br />
Hiring Game Masters is a lengthy and expensive process, and one that we are constantly going through. Speaking as a former Game Master myself, it's not an easy job. There's a lot of demands that need to be made, both from the employer and the players that you interact with. Much training is required, and even then, some tasks are limited to more experienced Game Masters.<br />
<br />
This is a topic that comes up frequently, and it seems to stem from the general lack of knowledge about how we do the things that we do in Customer Support. Some of that will have to remain a well-protected secret - we provide the best customer support that we can, and we feel that's something extremely valuable that no other company offers at the same level. We know it's important to you guys, and we agree.<br />
<br />
However, we're also working on ways to bring to light our policies, procedures, and our day to day lives here so that our players can better understand what's necessary to get these difficult tasks done in the best and most efficient way possible.

Tab Targeting and 4.2 Bugfix Patch<br />
To be clear, we know it's an annoying issue and it's unfortunate that it went live. But as I spoke in another thread a while back (a portion of which someone quoted earlier in this thread), this is a relatively complicated issue. We haven't just been sitting on it all this time. We want to make sure the fix is good, while also avoiding throwing together a quick patch to address it at the risk of breaking other things.<br />
<br />
Too me it sound like they didn't actually promise us a fix in this patch so I'm not certain what the fail comment is about.</div></div><hr />

You can tab target dead mobs.<br />
<br />
It's so fun when you're tanking and you're trying to use some ability on a dead mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I the only one that doesn't typically tab target when tanking? I prefer to click specific nameplates so that I can more precisely control my threat distribution. Tab targeting has always felt awkward to me. Not really any other use for the mouse mid-pull unless kiting. Even then, it's not hard to mouse-move and click nameplates when necessary.<br />
<br />
I've been tab targeting for 3 or 4 years. I see no reason to break the habit if it's been working for so long.<br />
<br />
I'll click name plates when I'm looking for specific mobs, but it's really just more time consuming than a quick key press.</div></div><hr />

I know everyone is raging about tab targeting still, but I'm glad heirloom tool-tips are back to gold. I wonder if the change to white text was intentional? Meh.</div></div><hr />

Played a tank with utility before? Tanked on a fight where you need to threat multiple mobs very quickly while stil similtanously use your mouse to pick up different mobs with mousever? I personally like being able to tank 12 mobs (ie heroic nef, or say heroic rhyoliths 10 mobs are up) tab while i'm threating while similtaniously using mouse to mouseover taunt different mobs, if i'm having to click mobs i'm not able to use my mouseover to taunt, or throw a LoH or salv on someone on my unit frames etc.<br />
<br />
Trust me this tab bug has made tanking a nightmare when you're used to multi tasking and using your mouse for other things then trying to select a mob standing right frigging next to your current target.Also as a dps on majordomo staghelm. if i target a kitty, then used an instant cast right away, the instant cast would hit staghelm instead of cat. You know how much of a pain in the ass that is? I haven't heard of a melee dps NOT get annoyed as hell on that fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure that the camera angle has nothing to do with tab targetting - you can turn your camera around backwards and still tab-target something that's in front of your character.<br />
<br />
As far as hunters and targetting goes - when I started having auto-target-something-across-the-room issues, I just adjusted my standing position; make sure you're not in range of targets you don't want to be shooting and all's well.</div></div><hr />

Yeah that's COMPLETELY POSSIBLE ALL OF THE TIME. Zzz. No. DK chasing you with a pet closer? Derp I don't want to hit the pet, I want to hit the DK. Good luck &quot;making sure you're not in range&quot; of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tab targeting is awesome. I let my nameplates overlap (because otherwise I simply cannot correlate the nameplate with the mob, and it massively screws with my sense of depth). When working normally tabbing and shift tabbing through adds is a fast way to get to the nearby mob I want (for example the nearby abberation that's starting to lose threat -- I love tidyplates :D) while leaving my mouse free to get further adds and use mouseover macros.<br />
<br />
While it sounds like the tab-targeting is still wonky (I haven't had a chance to play yet) it sounds like they fixed the issues that had me randomly re targeting dead mobs. Shit was a massive bitch on H Magmaw tanking adds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Prot warrior was my main for several years. I've never had a problem with clicking targets. Tab targeting is unpredictable and while it might give me a good-enough target (before the bug) 90% of the time, that other 10% matters to me. I am used to multitasking - a good tank has to be - but I guess I've never realistically been in such a dire situation where I feel the need to mouseover-taunt while also switching a local target for some other ability all within a half-second of each other.<br />
<br />
Admittedly there have been situations where I've used tab targeting, but it is not something that I regularly fall back on. I generally keep my mouse cursor hovered near interesting nameplates, ready to go. I can pick my lowest-threat target instantly and add start adding threat to it. I'm ready to grab anything that appears in the environment instantaneously, as my right hand has evolved into a lean, mean, target-picking machine.<br />
<br />
Alas, to each his own.</div></div><hr />

I suspect your mods/cache/internet connection. In fact I have never had more than a handful of disconnects in my history of WOW (except after wotlk release there was some serious issues). I think most DC is because of bad ISPs or running on wireless. At least whenever we raid and someone says &quot;i have some issues with the server d/c ing me&quot; they are almost always running on Wifi laptop.</div></div><hr />

Maybe, just maybe it wouldn't be too bad if you were actually allowed to randomly group up with people from other servers like with the LFD. But for now it just blows because people don't bother using it. The tool needs a complete revamp. Just let people group up with the dungeons using a similar idea like with the LFD but with the raid-browser, give them some &quot;extra&quot; reward for willingly suffer through the extra pain received. It don't get more hardcore than that.</div></div><hr />

Simply give them different tabs. The reason the LFR tool is so underused is cause it's so inconvenient to get to. If it's only a single click away a lot more people will use it.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully, this also fixes the targeting issues I've been having in PvP for the past few months as well -- I'll be attacking someone on the run, accumulating combo points, and then all of a sudden, I'm targeting someone else; usually behind me and well out of range.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that's been around ever since the change in WotLK. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for Blizzard to fix it this expansion, though. :|</div></div><hr />

Well said. Besides, everyone knows pugs are wipefests, I'm sure the people you'd find via raid browser wouldn't be any different. Probably worse in most cases.</div></div><hr />

Remember when they tried to shove Voice Chat down our throats? By turning it on by default ? Then they defended it like it was the second coming? Then claimed that all the reasons against it were just stubbornness ?<br />
<br />
I *think* that might have been the turning point for me in the &quot;is blizzard completely clueless?&quot; scale.</div></div><hr />

All the fireland trash had thier movement speed increased so you cannot solo the trash anymore.<br />
I suggest withdrawing all of your FL epics from the AH. They are gonna skyrocket... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmathes339</div><div class="date">2011-08-09, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with not putting the tokens up for jp or vp is that now if you're in a bad guild or no guild u have to pug for them. Guess what, most guilds don't want you to go unless you've done the raid before. Blizz wanted to kill pugging by introducing all of the guild stuff, and now pugging is basicly dead unless you want to carry some chump who has no idea wtf he's doing, or run with elitest idiots who just want to fly through crap on alts. Would it be such a travisty to go back to the late WotLK model? I thought it was damn fair imo. Keep the tokens for people to get them for &quot;free&quot;, but let the option of getting a full set of gear for points also exist for the unlucky or unguilded. Its the fairest model. That way half of us aren't looking like rejects with awsome t12 set, and then troll leftovers on top. :P</div></div><hr />
