Blizzard trademarked Mists of Pandaria (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2399-Mists-of-Pandaria) earlier this year.<br />
J. Allen Brack mentioned in an interview that Pandas &quot;sounds like something we may be talking about at BlizzCon.&quot; (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2450-Rogue-Legendary-Dagger-and-Patch-4.3-Interviews-Comics).<br />

Dragon Soul PTR Testing - Ultraxion, Blackhorn, and Spine of Deathwing<br />
More of the Dragon Soul raid was tested recently and n1kftw (http://www.youtube.com/user/n1kftw) was once again kind enough to upload videos of the encounters on Youtube for us. <br />
<br />
It also seems that some guilds were able to reach the Madness of Deathwing, even if the testing wasn't available. This is a nice first peek at the last raid encounter of the Cataclysm expansion! <br />

Number of Changes in Patch 4.3<br />
As we mentioned in the Rate of Change blog not long ago, we feel like we have reached a point where too many changes can do as much damage as not enough changes. It shouldn’t be too surprising to see lots of requests (or demands!) here on the forums for balance changes, whether those are small numbers tweaks or larger ability redesigns. The risk of the echo chamber effect can be strong though. A great majority of players don’t participate in forum discussions at all, and even among those who do, it tends to be those with a grievance who make a post. Indifferent players don’t often post to say they are indifferent, and many players won’t expend the effort to publicly state that they disagree with your idea. (When they do, they also risk igniting some exhausting flame wars.) But you have to remember that even if it seems like “everyone” is rallying for a certain change, you’re not seeing the majority and you have no idea if they would agree with the necessity of the change. <br />
<br />
When asked directly, they might not even disagree with the their character getting buffed or a mechanic smoothed out. But over time these seemingly “no brainer” changes can build up into an intimidating list. Class changes, especially in between expansions, and especially when hotfixed in between two patches, can be exhausting for many players. They don’t want to have to figure out if their rotation or gear strategies have changed overnight. They don’t want to have to devour all the latest theorycrafting and wonder if they’re supposed to respec every time they log in. That sort of thing may be fun for a lot of you guys – the active forum community. Heck, it’s fun for the kind of people that end up being game developers. But that doesn’t mean it’s healthy for the game. We have to weigh very carefully whether a seemingly innocuous change is worth making, because those changes are not “free” in the sense that they do burn some political capital with players. We have definitely been getting the message lately that the design churn in the last few patches has been too great, so we’re trying to be more cautious.<br />
<br />
It's the kind of topic that is worth discussing though. It may be that small changes to passive abilities, like the hunter, warlock and DK tweaks in 4.3, are small enough not to bother people. On the other hand, it could be that some players may be still living under a fear of change and we haven’t scaled back enough.<br />
<br />
We didn’t say we weren’t going to make balance changes when we feel they are justified, and we have made many for 4.3 already. We just wanted to point out that too many changes, even with the noblest of goals, can be as unhealthy for the game as failing to make changes that are necessary. We don’t want to hit either extreme. Some players seem to be looking for near constant balance adjustments (weekly or more often), and while the designers would be thrilled to do it, they also believe it would have severe long-term consequences. You may not know the kinds of players who get weary of constant design noodling, because they might not post on the forums, but there are a lot of them out there. Our strategy will continue to be: make most changes in expansions, some changes with patches, and the occasional change via hotfix.

Is Cataclysm the final expansion?<br />
Cataclysm is absolutely not the last expansion. We have plenty of vigor left in us yet. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/203280/is-cataclysm-are-now-the-final-expansion) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3412921278?page=1#10))<br />

No Word of Glory through Beacon?<br />
Word of Glory definitely triggers BoL. That was an oversight in the patch notes posted 90 minutes ago. We apologize for the confusion. We have updated the notes to read: <br />
<br />
Beacon of Light is triggered by Word of Glory, Holy Shock, Flash of Light, Divine Light and Light of Dawn at 50% transference and Holy Light at 100% transference. It does not transfer Holy Radiance, Protector of the Innocent or other sources of healing.

PTR: Holy Paladin Changes<br />
The 4.3 design is that Holy Radiance generates Holy Power if you have the Tower of Radiance talent. This is the only way it has ever worked for 4.3. In a nutshell, we did not want Ret and Prot paladins using Holy Radiance on cooldown just for the Holy Power benefit. It looks like some bad data-mining may have led to the belief that Holy Radiance would always generate Holy Power even without Tower of Radiance, but that was never the intent. The quote “Holy Radiance no longer grants a charge of Holy Power,” [post 1] is likewise incorrect and confusing. Before 4.3 there was no connection between Holy Radiance and Holy Power. After 4.3, the Tower of Radiance talent provides the Holy Power. We will let you know if the design changes again, but do not anticipate that being the case.

LOL no no no no. They change a pet model and some part of the community will be up in arms and start some crusade that people seem to follow blindly until they get what they want or something else happens and that becomes the new flavor to bash on. Flavor of the month shouldn't refer to classes anymore but what the whiners are going on about.<br />

No kidding. I was flipping through my image folders and saw tons of pictures of Cataclysm content from the first week of October, two years ago. Pretty much everyone exactly two years ago knew exactly what was coming announcements-wise at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
It seems like they narrowed down their F&amp;F alpha lists to stamp out all the leakers.<br />

Not...quite. One is saying &quot;If we were going to talk about something like that, it'd be at Blizzcon.&quot; And the other is saying &quot;We'll be talking about that at Blizzcon.&quot; Minor difference though, its not really worth nitpicking.</div></div><hr />

They'll be talking about it at BlizzCon whether it's the new expansion or not. They always talk about pandas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would design it as: Your raid group snatches onto Deathwings tail and then you make your way to his head. From tail to head its basically a survival fight. Surviving barrel rolls and shakes along with killing things along the way. Once you reach his head, you focus on his eyes and take him down. <br />
<br />
Next fight: You actually fight Deathwing. Since DW is so powerful, it requires both factions to kill him. So 10 man raids need to have 10 Alliance and 10 Horde. With all hatred aside, each faction knows they need to work together. 25 man raids would consist of a 50 man team. <br />
<br />

As awesome as that would be I highly, highly doubt it would happen, let alone work. There are too many people that hate the other faction/don't know a raid team on the opposing faction to even pull that off.</div></div><hr />

He was always supposed to be that big. If it wasn't during questing, etc. it's because it would be hard to put him into places and cinematics.<br />

In the first battle we only remove part of his armor so the ships can fire into the wound, that's easy (lorewise). In the last battle all Aspects plus Thrall are there to help us.</div></div><hr />

That was just a way to avoid saying anything compromising. Also, I believe he was talking about playable Pandaren, which some people thought (think) there will be and it's unlikely (right after worgen/goblin, faction/silhouette issues, etc).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason for being those fights undertuned is so that the bugs can be quickly detected and fixed, similar to how it was with Ragnaros's mechanics, where nothing in PTR hurt you(assuming an average ilvl below 365), whereas on live it was an entirely different story...<br />

Well it's working perfectly fine for me in the UK. We're in Daylight Savings time at the moment but UTC never changes, that means in that in the Netherlands you'll be 2 hours ahead of UTC. The opening ceremony is at 18:00 UTC which means it starts at 20:00 at your local time.<br />
<br />
I hope that clears up the mix-up with the time zones ;)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and how many times did they say that they had no plans for Old World Flying due to the fact that they'd have to re-do the whole old world to support it, claiming it was too much work, etc. And while still denying it, they went ahead and did it anyway.</div></div><hr />

Too many changes means, you tried to address as many problems as possible, failing to make changes means you didn't even try to do anything and over time the list of problems builds up. Btw. it's usually op classes/specs who don't like changes.</div></div><hr />

No. Thrall is not an aspect. Not at all. At best he a kind of a place holder until they figure out how to make a new Earth Warder. No one but a dragon can be an aspect. This is specifically stated in the book Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects.</div></div><hr />

They cannot afford not to announce anything new because of all the new MMO competition (star wars mmo) and all the players leaving WoW because it's getting boring.

Seriously? It's a 'pinkie swear' not a 'Pinkie Pie swear'. This is why people hate us. (Then again, this type of behavior can be seen in every type of fandom, regardless of what it is. Some fans will look at any and everything as a reference to their beloved interests, regardless of what the actual meaning may be.)<br />
<br />
I'm believe that MoP will be the next expansion. All the facts and logic are there. Chilton's response that was quoted already was the best example of a non-answer I have seen in a long time. I live on the opposite side of the country from Blizzcon and it's too expensive to even consider going in any time in the future. I'd get the livestream like I did for Blizzcon two years ago but the dates of this and last year's kept me from getting the stream. My daughter is more important since I only get to see her every other weekend (along with a couple of hours during the week).</div></div><hr />

It's good that you see that the team in charge of designing pets and mounts is doing a great job, but I don't think they're taking away from the time and effort all the other teams are putting into their parts of the game.

On topic. Best looking raid ever made imo. I know a lot of people like to think blizz doesn't keep up their standards anymore. But if you really stop with the nostalgia and go back to any old raid. Its really no where as amazing as cata has been. And i love being able to actually use WoW's environments for more than just 2 hours of questing =).<br />

You might want to consider the fact that the livestream includes recordings of the events so you can watch them at a later date (up to two weeks I believe).

No, what Boub's shown suggests that Pandas are going to be discussed. In the interview, they used that same answer for both questions about the expansion.

I still am just absolutely SHOCKED that there hasn't been even a teensy eensy leak yet, unless you count the trademark (which was inevitable being as it's public domain). By this time last year, we were rolling in leaks; even in Burning Crusade the Draenei models were leaked a couple days before Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
And yet, here we are, Blizzcon is less than two days away and... not a peep. Nothing. It's... odd.</div></div><hr />

I still am just absolutely SHOCKED that there hasn't been even a teensy eensy leak yet, unless you count the trademark (which was inevitable being as it's public domain). By this time last year, we were rolling in leaks; even in Burning Crusade the Draenei models were leaked a couple days before Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
And yet, here we are, Blizzcon is less than two days away and... not a peep. Nothing. It's... odd.<br />
<br />
I find it extremely odd as well that nothing has been leaked, and Boub is being cheeky about it so I know he must know something. The only explanation I can think of is Blizz wised up and payed him off.</div></div><hr />

Deathwing doesn't -do- anything, you just fight adds and if you stand on the same side for 10 sec you wipe. Big deal.Could've known that when they said &quot;He'll do all sorts of cool stuff to get rid of you, such as barrel rolls&quot; that that would be the -only- thing he'd do.And you can't even see the world moving under him, was really looking forward to that.</div></div><hr />

They said like a thousand times that there will be anything about TITAN at this Blizzcon, and i honestly doubt that there will be info on titan at the next Blizzcon</div></div><hr />

The cinematic will hopefully explain the story behind his tentacled arms beyond just speculation etc. He is a little to big though in comparison to the other aspects.</div></div><hr />

It's funny you say that, Cory Stockton (lead content designer) just tweeted this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Finishing up rehearsals on the big stage at BlizzCon. We are really blowing it out this year, can't wait!<br />
<br />
<br />
What are the odds, eh?</div></div><hr />

This is so true and in blizzard form as of late when it comes to blizzcon. A lot of hype with little payoff.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure there was a blue post saying there wouldn't be any information about Titan at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
I wonder what everyone's reaction will be when in a day and a half, they announce Mist of Pandaria as the next expansion.</div></div><hr />
