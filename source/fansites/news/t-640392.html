Where have you been so far? Hunters arena helm has looked like this the whole season already ..doubt it can be a big surprice anymore that it is cloth-like looking.</div></div><hr />

What you may think is the worst in WoW history, another may like. The sets' appearances can never cater to everyone's ideal look for their class/character. Just deal with it =/ If they listened to you and made the set what you wanted it to look like, there'd still be thousands of people who despised the design. It's what comes with playing an MMO. Individual opinion is largely overlooked, unless it's an issue like class mechanics or something, but as far as t8/s6 gear is concerned, I'm generally happy with their designs. (Using the same weapon/armor template for almost every drop in Naxx and Ulduar - granted, these could be placeholders for the PTR - is a completely different story.)</div></div><hr />

In BC it was copies of the tier sets, and now this. Ok, yeah, they steared clear of the set clones, but honestly I'd rather go back to that than look at these PvP sets they obviously put no time or effort into. Also, the fact that s6 is just a revamp of s5 makes their lack of effort even more apparent.</div></div><hr />

This time, a complete failure on Blizzard's part. The worst is easily the DK set though which made me think of somebody getting ready to hop onto a motorcycle.<br />
<br />
Just horrid sets.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MuTe</div><div class="date">2009-03-24, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually like these sets.. even the rogue ones. It looked horrible on Human males, but seeing em on different races actually make em cool.<br />
Not on all races, but thats because some of the races are just plain ugly, like gnomes, female dwarfs, and male humans :p.<br />
I actually think the Rogue set on a Nelf or Belf looks totally awesome. Priest set could use some work, dont like the piece of cloth in front of the dress (yes its not a robe, its a dress)<br />
<br />
I do prefer the Hunter helm of S5 more then this one, it now kinda looks like Prince of Persia or something.<br />
Warrior set is best, DK also really cool except for the helm (hide). <br />
Think Shaman is the worst of the sets, but just because of the baby blue colors. The design itself it quite nice imo.<br />
<br />
Thing i like about these sets is that they are very recognizable, wich makes it easier to determine a players level of gear in Arena. In S5 i could not tell the level of gear at all, it was to plain (still cool though). I still think Paladin is still a little to plain, maybe some nice pink and purple colors would cheer them up?</div></div><hr />

Actually I do like current and next season hunter pvp sets. At least they don't look ugly on my male troll unlike almost every set since T0.<br />

And shaman shoulders suck bigtime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Every single one of these helms looks like something I would have drawn when I was in highschool while bored in study hall....that I would have thrown away or scratched out because they looked stupid. Seriously, what happened to the people at Blizzard who know how to make cool looking helms? I never see anybody showing their helm anymore, because they all look so terrible.<br />
<br />
And why did they decide to give shaman wings made out of fish scales for shoulders? Every other set stayed very similar to this seasons', except they somehow made Shaman look even worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At any rate, the rogue set isn't bad. The helm is rather simplistic, and the white could be exchanged by black. It'd be a decent set.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">overneathe</div><div class="date">2009-03-24, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So many people on this site for the last 2 years. So much bullshit. People register just to comment how awful something is and they don't have a single comment praising something that Blizzard has done. Ever. If you don't like ANYTHING then fuckin quit this game and stop spamin the forums with your idiocy. This would be such a great forum without you trolls, like it was back in the old days. Discussions, jokes, just plain fun. What a game forum is supposed to be like.<br />
<br />
Don't like the PVP sets? Ok.<br />
<br />
I like the PVP sets. I'm a hunter and I like the hunter arena set though I'll never have it because I don't actually do arena. Hunters have always been stealthy and camouflage-like. At least lore wise. It's only natural (to people with brains) that they wear such armors that suit more a ranger than a guy with eyeballs on the soldiers. It's not your dream set, but face it, your dream set will never be made because it's just not you designing the sets. Go ahead and apply to Blizz as designer and make it happen then! I'm curious to see what you have to offer to 12 million people every one of which would love your idea.<br />
<br />
I love the rogue set. In my opinion it looks outstanding and is as close to D0/D0.5 on design and just plain rogueness. What, did you like? T4? T5? T6 maybe? What do these have to do with rogues? How do they hint that this is a class that stealths and stabs you in the spine? It was just colorful parts of a set that had nothing to do with the class that is wearing it.<br />
<br />
Warrior set? I'm not even gonna comment on that. If I see someone runing to me on the streets with that outfit I'd fuckin run miles. Wont you? Or you're gonna say &quot;LOL AT UR SPIEKZ&quot;. It's what it's supposed to be, a heavy battle suit. And it has spikes. Stfu.<br />
<br />
Death Knights - Ok, I get it, the helm is fuckin not on the place it should be and just hangs like a bell attached to your head. Sweet. BUT, the previous season set had all the skulls as pictures, on this one they're actually models sticking out of the armor. That is not an upgrade? I'd take that set anyday tbh. /hide helm and woot, fuckin ace. Can't wait to see the evolution in S7, one of the sets I'm most excited about.<br />
<br />
Druids. Sadly Boubou is using some really angry looking models that kinda take away a bit of the armor's shininess. But beyond that - it's a fucking great set. It's very detailed, it's got bark on it and it's got leaves. The lower part of the helm is a bit bloated but I can live with that fact. Just what did you want your druid to wear? The warrior set? Did you wan't him to look like a dinosour? I dunno, it's just how I've always imagined druids should look like. In my opinion this set is as close to T1 and T2 as it can. And there is no better set that shows how druids look in the universe that is Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Mages, you do look kind of boring. Compared to other sets you've gotten over the years this looks a bit too plain. Hopefully Blizz have some good plans for that in the future. But beyond troll females it does look at least stylish (no gnomes, your sets will always be ugly, sorry, it's how Blizz wants it and I approve).<br />
<br />
Pallies - there is indeed a bit of a bloat on that helm, it could've been not so bulky. And I'm sure you've all wanted it to stand out a bit more. What's good about the set is that it's highly distinguishable and is indeed a clear upgrade from S5. I'm only curious just what have Blizz planned for the future of this set.<br />
<br />
Priests - now, I'm sure priests would also like their set to be a lot more noticable and with a bit more of that detail that some of the other sets have (e.g. Warlocks) but at least mages and priests don't look alike anymore. I can see the hood is going to grow into something really interesting in a season or two. The fact that there weren't a lot of upgrades from S5 hints that in the next season there will be a ton of new details. I'm 100% sure of that.<br />
<br />
Yes, Warlocks are detailed. To an extreme. Look at those shoulders, do you notice the small little skulls on it? That single piece makes a huge difference compared to the other classes that have almost no detailed artwork on them. Yet. Also the shoulders themselves have very interesting curves. That &quot;pacifier&quot;? It doesn't take an IQ beyond 80 to see this is not what it's going to look like when it's released. Let's wait and see before we shit on it mkay? Nah, let's all look like morons and just spit before it gets fixed. Because, you know, Blizz is releasing all these sets and texture and their official site, because they're happy with what they look like at this stage. Owait.<br />
<br />
What do you see in the Shaman set that is wrong? Please, explain to me. The helm? Have you actually looked at it? Did you notice how it stands on all races that can roll a shaman? Do you notice how it makes everyone look pissed and badass? And what about those shoulders? It's just ice growing out of your armor. That is so sad right? I mean, you don't have anything frosty in your spells I'm sure. This is THE set that I'm looking forward to in the next few seasons. I think I'll absolutely love its future.<br />
<br />
This is what a post should look like. This is called a constructive post. These last few months now all I see is trolling, spaming, general assholism and a big chunk of pure idiocy.<br />
I'd love to see someone critique these sets and my post, but with manner and style. Post like &quot;lol horrible&quot; or &quot;gg blizz, u made me quit arenas, for the 70th time, why am I so stupid to still play them&quot; are just not neccessery and you're not really giving people the impression that behind your keyboard is human being. More like one of those bots spaming porn and adds.<br />
Gimme some criticism, cmon. I need to see that this site still has some of those good members from the old days left.</div></div><hr />

Im just trying to help those 12 year old kids that are thinking to cancel their accounts because they dont like the Rogue sets. As it seem there are some in THIS thread quiting the game because of the way the sets look on Rogues (added the fact that Rogues are fine in both PVE and PVP, and they cant accept that). <br />

You can argue that it &quot;looks like&quot; an assassin, but really, it &quot;looks like&quot; terrible. The diamond on the top of the head, the oddly shaped shoulders, the &quot;what were you thinking?&quot; color scheme: it all adds up to a poorly designed set. Besides, when are we going to ditch the mask? Does Blizzard not see how it clips through nearly every single hair style in the game?<br />
<br />
Luckily, I don't really care all too much what a set looks like, besides that fact that it's distinguishable. That's the big issue I take with this set. I'd rather it was rehashed T8 or something like that. When I get new gear I want to be able to see an appreciable aesthetic difference, and when other people are wearing new gear, I want to be able to identify it.<br />
<br />
Oh well, nothing any of us can do on this forum by bickering as to personal taste. I don't like it, some may like it, in the end Blizzard has chosen it as our model for our gear; it's not going to change.</div></div><hr />

Its just not take a existing model, slap on a new skin and attach a few points.<br />
<br />
For druids you have two races that you have to design: Night Elf and Tauren, male and female.<br />
<br />
Now besides that you have to do all the spell casting animation. Moonfire, shapeshifting, hurricane, bloodlust, trinket buffs animation etc. On top of that you have to do attack animations getting ready to attack animations, as well as the actual attack animations, With every weapon type. So thats 1hSwords, Maces, Axes, Daggers, Fists, Two handed swords, Two Hand axes, Two Handed Maces, Stave's, Bow's, Crossbows, Guns, Throwing. To top it all off you have to make sure all the other animations work, you know all the emotes and such that random people do. If the animations don't work, you get these lovely blue and white cubes where the animation is supposed to be. <br />
<br />
Basically for Male Night Elf Druids you have to do about 60+ animations with each piece of the set armor. Multiply that by 10 races and 9 classes? Assuming 20 minutes per animation, that is a staggering amount of time needed to develop the designs and armor.<br />
<br />
I don't know what fantasy world some people live in, but animation is not easy, and animators are not readily available, and I don't believe that gaming set animation is something that many people in animation wants to go work in. According to my friend, it pays shit, people in the industry laugh at you when you want to work in real animation. <br />
<br />
Also the people that do the work do check out sites and read forum posts. They put in alot of time for the your entertainment. Be thankful that your getting different sets between PVP and PVE. If your that hung up over things like how armors look, and if you want to quit over armor looks, I'm sure you can go play EQ or WAR where the armors look *sarcasm* so much better. *sarcasm*</div></div><hr />

Actually, scroll a few posts up and see that i said the Rogue PVP set is nice, i did not quote anyone in my 1st post. Then you started quoting me, and calling me blind irl and retarded. YOU sir are the one that started trolling, and not the other way around. You can hate yourself for talking shit and cant it up (i lolled at this comment rly :-X).<br />
<br />
Now if you take my 1st post personal then there must be some truth in it, and im glad you helped making my point valid.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your conversation with that brick wall.. i hope it will help you to become a better person and player. *munch *munch Popcorn tastes good!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they look awesome.<br />
The S5 hunter one reminds me of the D&amp;D Ranger.<br />
Rogues looks like they were imported from Assasins Creed. <br />
Warrior looks like gladiators.<br />
Warlocks look like some mad Alchemist/ Necromancer.<br />
<br />
Death knights lol @ gnomes<br />

<br />
I honestly didn't hear one person saying that ever. I think what would be closer to the truth is PVErs wanting the PVP sets to not look like theirs, not the other way around. The old sets were awesome, and these suck. It's real simple. I was completely satisfied every season even if they were just recolors. I know that I feel the opposite about these sets, even though they're different. Bring back recolors imo :/ This is a failed experiment!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow. Really, you want to quit a game because you dont like PvP Armor Sets?<br />
Sad sad sad. If you don't like it, don't do PvP. WoW was not designed as a PvP game anyways.<br />
<br />
MuTe ftw! ;D you always make me laugh :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jushak</div><div class="date">2009-03-25, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow @ all the QQ. I for one am happy about everything expect the DK helm and that's easily cured by ticking &quot;show helm&quot; away. Shaman one looks a bit odd though. Most of them look like something you might actually use in arena fights instead of parade armor that majority of the sets are.<br />
<br />
The plates are all great forgetting the said DK helm which is the ugliest thing I can remember, but who the hell uses show helm anyway? Not anyone I know.<br />
<br />
Besides, it's all matter of taste. People QQing are much more vocal than people who are happy with the sets.<br />
<br />
Oh and lol @ people saying they &quot;quit&quot; because of these sets. Like anyone cares.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gigikent</div><div class="date">2009-03-25, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe if ppl will quit because they don't like how a set will look like, that's just silly imo. The sets do look a bit funky but heck, do you play this game because of looks? Your character looks like a cow on 2 legs, who the heck cares what you have on ? :) See my point? It's all pixels and fantasy, just embrace it. I'm not a fan of the current PvP or even PvE sets tbh, past ones were much better designed. WotlK is being rushed into the market, it has been so since they launched (launched a x-pac that was not too close to being complete). You can deduce the lack of completness just by looking at what you are doing for the past months: Naxx and 2 more bosses. <br />
<br />
The expansion was rushed, Ulduar is gonna be for 2-3 monts total on the PTR (pretty long don't you think?). At least they didn't fail at releasing content that was too bugged or incomplete. What we have now is at least very playable and I hope they at least keep it that way.</div></div><hr />

Druid: Looks allright<br />
Hunter: Helm looks silly cause of its cloth'ish style<br />
Mage: Looks cool, i think<br />
Paladin: Looks good<br />
Priest: Shoulder and Helm models could be cooler but its okay <br />
Rogue: Color sucks but the set is ok<br />
Shaman: Whole set looks odd<br />
Warlock: Looks cool<br />
Warrior: Not many changes from the S5 version but ok<br />
<br />
thats my opinion on these sets. overall they fit for arena sets and I like the idea of having a set and upgrading it with cool tweaks in every season...<br />

What you may think is the worst in WoW history, another may like. The sets' appearances can never cater to everyone's ideal look for their class/character. Just deal with it =/ If they listened to you and made the set what you wanted it to look like, there'd still be thousands of people who despised the design. It's what comes with playing an MMO. Individual opinion is largely overlooked, unless it's an issue like class mechanics or something, but as far as t8/s6 gear is concerned, I'm generally happy with their designs. (Using the same weapon/armor template for almost every drop in Naxx and Ulduar - granted, these could be placeholders for the PTR - is a completely different story.)<br />
<br />
Still the point is that these sets look ugly and exactly like season 5 except for the color and stats, blizzard needs to look back on lvl 70 and see how brutal was and go from there, season 5 and 6 look like they should have come before season 1, the sets that look slighty cool are vengeful and brutal and maybe merciless on lvl 70, blizzard should go from there and build up and not do some lame shit like the rogue having his mouth closed off, that looks like something like oppurtunist blue gear on lvl 70, so yeah the big point is these sets look ancient and suckish , brutal looks a shitload better..</div></div><hr />

I love this armor. It dosent reflect PVe gear, which i hate. its original. and if u look at it, it actualy looks like what a gladiator would wear. Cat wait to get this. the only one that let me down was the rouges. oh well.</div></div><hr />
