<br />
Oh well I'll hear about what happened at it later, seeing as they'll be announcing Northrend there.</div></div><hr />

I mean 68 for zul aman ? no .... i think that new continent in next expansion is availible from level 68 like outlands 58. Just my opinion</div></div><hr />

So all this testing will be for the new expansion.<br />
<br />
Not showing the expansion off at their major event would be a disaster.</div></div><hr />

Zerg poured through it and wiped out all of Zangarmarsh, now you must go stop the Overmind and protect yourself against the psionic Protoss, devouring Zerg, and reckless Terrans!<br />
<br />
Those wishing to go to this new zone should inquire with the Cenarion Expedition before going, must be exalted with every faction (even booty bay AND bloodsail) and kill every final boss of every last dungeon (including 60 dungeons, we value our old content =D) to start the quest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-07-28, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but see I think Blizzard realized the error in that by now, I mean maybe a 59 sneaking in there but a 56? Not to mention they couldn't use anything that dropped there.</div></div><hr />

however they also said that the powers that druids would have were also available to other classes but just very hard tog et...or soemthing in that direction......so maybe like flightform....other classes will have to sue a item or ability to trigger the special capabilitys druids have</div></div><hr />

<br />
So druids have gotten enough alrdy and locks too after that the pallies.....So let other classes get something!</div></div><hr />
