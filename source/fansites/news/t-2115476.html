Chris Metzen Interview<br />
Scott Johnson has a great interview with Chris Metzen about the events leading up to his retirement. A recap can't really do it justice, but we left some rough notes below to give you an idea of what was covered. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/293209922&amp;amp;color=5ec766&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=tru e&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Leaving Blizzard was an incredibly difficult thing to do. Metzen had been there since he was a kid and it was his whole life, his identity, all consuming. Blizzard allowed him to realize all of the dreams he had when he was younger. <br />
The years working on Titan were very frustrating. <br />
There was lots of stress and fear. What if the next game or project isn't perfect? What if people hate it? What if he dishonors the company or himself by not performing well enough? <br />
There was a vicious loop of performing well and then expectation to perform well for the next thing. <br />
It doesn't matter if your game is a hit and people love your work, you have to outdo it the next time. <br />
When the Titan project was cancelled, Metzen was at a very low place, very frustrated and unsure that he wanted to keep doing it.<br />
After Titan the team came up with the Overwatch idea. <br />
Metzen wasn't sure if he could be a Creative Director and leader, getting everyone fired up and held together. <br />
In his mind he romanticized it as one last charge at the wall, motivated by his love for Blizzard and his friends. <br />
He felt like his friends and Blizzard needed him, which is a very powerful emotion. He wanted to do right by all of his people. <br />
Titan was so heartbreaking in many ways. Too many people were protecting their own visions and instincts for what it should be. People stopped communicating and developing together. The team fractured.<br />
Overwatch was a gift and blessing. It reminded everyone of where they were strongest. The fact that it did well is just icing on the cake. <br />
What Metzen will remember when he is 80 is the joy of getting to build Overwatch with that team and what it felt like to pull each other up again.<br />
Metzen had wanted to do solo cinematics that could stand alone for years and being able to do so for Overwatch was very fun. <br />
He started having panic attacks and anxiety during the year or two leading up to his retirement. He didn't know they were panic attacks originally and ended up in urgent care where they couldn't find anything wrong with him. <br />
He is somewhat introverted and enjoys being in familiar and comfortable situations. He doesn't go out a lot and doesn't have a lot of friends outside of Blizzard after all of these years. He is doing better about that now, reaching out to people now that he has more energy to do so. <br />
Metzen told his kids that they would go to BlizzCon for a few hours this year to see Weird Al. The panic started coming back right before BlizzCon, so he didn't go. <br />
At one point he was in a state of constant panic for several days. His wife told him that it wasn't something he was just going to walk off and he went and got help. Deep down he knew he wanted to be done, but he didn't know how to accept it. He would have never let go of Blizzard or what he felt was his obligation to all of the people there if this hadn't happened. <br />
Blizzard is a great group of people and they would be fine without him, he wouldn't be failing anyone by leaving. It's almost like he needed someone to tell him that he had done well and it is was okay to rest now.<br />
Being home with his family has been amazing. The only thing he really misses is his friends. <br />
There is action in the day as a creative leader, interacting with people you love to jam with on fun ideas. Then there is the part that is actually building it, having to account for all of the people and the project, the politics, being the boss, having the pressure of having lives and careers in your hands. He misses talking about cool ideas with friends. <br />
Metzen may have work in the years to come, but struggles to imagine joining a corporation again or becoming a corporate officer again. <br />
He will want to tell stories again, but in a far more limited capacity. <br />
Maybe eventually he will work on something with Christie Golden.<br />
Metzen doesn't want to leap back in to the creative arena before he is ready to do so. He needs to consider why he is doing it and only do it if it is because it brings him joy. If it is for any other reason, such as keeping his swords sharp, avoiding being forgotten, or proving that he still has it, then it would be a mistake to do it. <br />

12th Anniversary Event<br />
We gave away a Molten Corgi (a pun on the name of the Molten Core raid) for logging in during the 10th anniversary. We received a lot of positive feedback about how cute the little pup was, so like most pet families in the game, a few more variants have been added.<br />
<br />
So, for the 12th anniversary you have the option to buy another cute Corgi pup with the 200 Timewalking Badges you're given simply for logging in during the event. You can also get an extra 25 badges per day just by testing your lore knowledge via the daily quest which is available for the duration of the anniversary event.<br />
<br />
Of course, should you prefer, you could instead spend those badges on previous anniversary items like the Inflatable Thunderfury (did someone say....?) or Van Cleef Costume.<br />
<br />
Or, you could simply hold onto the badges and put them toward something sold by the Timewalking vendors during a Timewalking Dungeon bonus week.<br />
<br />
We've definitely heard that some people were disappointed by the Corgi, the cuteness isn't for everyone, and we'll forward that feedback on.<br />
<br />
All that being said:<br />
<br />
Happy 12th anniversary everyone! Thanks for being a part of the World of Warcraft! ❤️ (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/784663-nothing-says-wow-like-a/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17614481849?page=2#32))<br />

Patch 7.1.5 Class Changes<br />
I did leave notes in multiple class forums that 7.1.5 is very much in flux, and that's basically what I did in the mage forum. These other comments came later in the day, near to when I was leaving the office, so I didn't have time to dive into conversations with Warlocks, for example.<br />
<br />
We have notes for other specs that we will be sharing throughout the length of the 7.1.5 PTR, but we are not necessarily ready to talk about the state of every spec at this time - Fire is just in a more solid place. I do plan on sharing more 7.1.5 information today and tomorrow as stuff comes to me that is more set-in-stone.

Patch 7.1.5 Fire Changes<br />
As a quick example of the &quot;in flux&quot; status of 7.1.5, we are currently testing a change to the Marquee Bindings that would bring the damage down to 250% instead of 200% (down from 300% on live).<br />
<br />
With ice flows, that is reasonable[/i]<br />
Noticed. I've passed the feedback along that Ice Flows is one of the the things that player's feel are hurting the spec. As said, we are still iterating, so I'll update you guys as things come to me.

Artifacts<br />
So, when will you guys increase the drop chance of the WW hidden artifact? No drop, running the scenario since launch<br />
A future patch will add a form of bad luck prevention to this and similar &quot;hidden&quot; Artifact Appearances. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/798233901885886466))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
If it’s not problematic for you to do so, would you mind talking to us a bit about the original WoW Death Knight that you were part of designing in Wrath of the Lich King? I’m very curious about how it was built from the ground up, what sorts of challenges you faced and what it ended up becoming.<br />
I could talk about this for days, probably. At the high level, there were a few goals:<br />
<br />
1) Create another plate-using class with different abilities and feel than the warrior or paladin. Runes were already conceived before I joined the team as a way to avoid rage or mana (or energy). We hit upon diseases as the primary driver of the rotation: apply a disease, do damage, remove the disease with a finisher. Obviously the rotations have evolved enormously since then. <br />
<br />
2) Experiment with having spec not strictly tied to role. We tried letting Blood, Frost and Unholy all tank and all DPS or PvP (with slightly different builds). This meant coming up with separate but ideally equal tanking cooldowns for example, and ideas such as Bladed Armor to let DKs benefit from the natural defenses on their DPs-oriented gear.<br />
<br />
3) Deliver on expectations from Arthas and the Warcraft RTS about how a death knight would play. Example: Death and Decay was an iconic DK ability that WoW had given to the Warlocks. Pets felt like something we needed to deal with. Healing had to be really kit-appropriate. <br />
<br />
4) Make a viable class. This may seem like a no-brainer, but it was a challenge back in the BC era. Early on, some of the hardcore raiders at Blizzard said they couldn’t fit a DK into their raid roster because the parties were so static (e.g. you need a shaman with the rouges for WF, so where was the DK going to fit?). This led to a lot of rethinking about raid buffs, including raid options for who brought what, party vs raid-wide buffs, and whether it was okay to have specs who were only useful for buffing.<br />
<br />
5) Because I didn’t know the WoW spell system very well from a technical perspective, I came up with a lot of new ideas. The upside of this was that they were new idea that pushed the team a little to implement new things. The downside was that it caused a lot of bugs (particularly with Shadow of Death, or whatever the talent that let you come back to life). Even with the “hero class” concept, we know we had to present an argument to players over why they should pick the DK as their new main. We knew we had to do something different. Death Grip (which was mostly Xelnath) was key in this regard.<br />
<br />
6) I think a lot of the DK success had to do with Acherus and the quest experience, which was mostly Afrasiabi. I helped with that, but I was more focused on abilities and talents. Just wanted to call that out.<br />
<br />
7) It was also really important to me to involve the community. The only way I knew how to develop (from my decade working on Age of Empires) was to constantly ask players what was working and what needed work. The early DK community was awesome. They were overall really level-headed, open-minded and defaulted to trust, and I think this experience led to them feeling some level of ownership over the class rather than it strictly being something we passed down to them.<br />
<br />
Some issues I am remembering (or misremembering):<br />
<br />
There was a point where you could build a DK with something like 16 different diseases, which were all just generic, though there were abilities that scaled with disease count. Somewhere along the way we had the idea to just compress those down to two (Frost Fever and Blood Plague) and try and theme them more strongly. <br />
<br />
We struggled a ton with Chains of Ice, since it was iconic, but also dropping speed so dramatically was really powerful in PvP, especially for a tanky melee class with a lot of ranged spells.<br />
<br />
Originally, the intent was that Blood was the more melee focused and easy to play spec. Frost was more for min/maxxers who wanted to obsess over secondary stats, with a bit of casting thrown in. Unholy was originally more of a pet class (which was always super niche) and morphed into being more about spells and debuffing.<br />
<br />
We spent way too much effort trying to make the DK-specific enchants a thing, but we never balanced them well, and there was just a right answer most of the time. Go figure. Maybe it was worth it for the flavor, but I am kind of skeptical. (Do these still exist in WoW? Not sure.)<br />
<br />
I have mixed feeling about retreating from the idea that there was no dedicated tanking spec. I agreed with the decision (and might have suggested it for all I know), but a lot of that was because we were developing dual-spec at the same time, which made it much easier for someone to say swap to offtanking for just one fight. The class team was starting to feel like we were developing 6 specs of DK (Frost dps, Frost tank, etc.) and that is even ignoring things like DW vs 2H weapons, PvP and so on.<br />
<br />
Wow, that was quite the text dump. I hadn’t thought about this in while. If I am misremembering things, I apologize. (Source (http://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/153274097663/if-its-not-problematic-for-you-to-do-so-would))<br />

<br />
Prices rise when more people purchase tokens, people see the increased gold they get for said tokens, more tokens flood the market, token price goes back down and things stabilise. Can't ever imagine it going for more than 120k in the most extreme scenario in EU.</div></div><hr />

Haha.. Stop QQing like crazy and go take a look at some data.. Mages are fine currently, but they are not OP in any way. Fire is good in AE fights, but not at the top and middle of the pack in single target encounters. Frost/Arcane is good in ST, but not at the top. And especially Frost is shit in AE right now.

You realize that's probably why he did voice acting instead of regular acting. When you voice act, you are alone in a studio and don't have to interact with other people most of the time. But keep mocking him for having a problem, ya douche bag.</div></div><hr />

Im stating facts, basing my opinion only in facts. I think you need some data so I give it to you.<br />
<br />
In every patch of every expansion mage had at least one spec in top 5 dmg, wtvr the sim or practical situation. Fact.<br />
Since legion was launched, every patch they talk about mages cause from what I see the best thing they do is QQ just like you did since you have no facts whatsoever. Fact.<br />

I hope he finds peace. Anxiety and panic attacks are no fun - he's a dad, too, and he needs to be there for his wife and kids, and if he's going through that...ugh. Not good. <br />
<br />
i think the lesson here is balance - don't go down the rabbit hole too deep, keep connections to the outside world, and step out on a regular basis. I work in a pretty stressful job that deals with hardcore deadlines, I get it - and that's what I've done for years - leave work AT WORK, and don't spend more time there than necessary, and do things outside of work unrelated to it - even if it's video games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So mature. Also Kern made a failure of an MMO. GC went to an immensely popular game that still brings in a lot of users per month. Think I'd say he has it well in that situation.<br />
<br />
Also.<br />
<br />
He started having panic attacks and anxiety during the year or two leading up to his retirement. He didn't know they were panic attacks originally and ended up in urgent care where they couldn't find anything wrong with him.<br />
At one point he was in a state of constant panic for several days. His wife told him that it wasn't something he was just going to walk off and he went and got help. Deep down he knew he wanted to be done, but he didn't know how to accept it. He would have never let go of Blizzard or what he felt was his obligation to all of the people there if this hadn't happened.<br />
<br />
I can understand that. Nobody wants to be in panic or be stressed when it comes to any kind of design project. It doesn't help. After a long time with a company I can understand his loyalty to them and not wanting to leave. Panic attacks are never good either. Glad to see he seems to have gotten past most of it.</div></div><hr />

Okay.. Let's start going for the numbers.<br />
Warcraftlogs, last 2 Weeks, EN Mythic, 90th percentile:<br />
<br />
Nythendra: #8 Havoc DH, #11 Fire Mage, #12 Frost DK, #15 Arcane Mage, #16 Frost Mage, #20 Unholy DK<br />
Il'gynoth: #3 Havoc DH, #6 Arcane Mage, #10 Frost DK, #12 Fire Mage, #16 Unholy DK, #24 Frost Mage<br />
Elerethe: #4 Fire Mage, #9 Havoc DH, #10 Arcane Mage, #14 Frost DK, #20 Frost Mage, #23 Unholy DK<br />
Ursoc: #9 Havoc DH, #10 Frost DK, #11 Fire Mage, #13 Frost Mage, #14 Arcane Mage, #19 Unholy DK<br />
Dragons: #3 Fire Mage, #7 Havoc DH, #8 Frost DK, #9 Arcane Mage, #13 Unholy DK, #14 Frost Mage<br />
Cenarius: #11 Frost DK, #13 Havoc DH, #14 Unholy DK, #16 Arcane Mage, #18 Frost Mage, #20 Fire Mage<br />
Xavius: #3 Fire Mage, #4 Frost Mage, #6 Arcane Mage, #9 Havoc DH, #14 Frost DK, #20 Unholy DK<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh shit.. You were right! In one of 7 fights! Xavius.. Where all 3 mage specs excel because they can do split dmg to all tentacles.. Congratulations!<br />
<br />
Get your goddamn facts straight next time, thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Before you're screaming about &quot;buuh 90th Percentile&quot; Go check the 75th.. it looks almost the same.</div></div><hr />

You must have missed TBC when they were an absolute joke outside of if you had 2 pc tier 5, 2-3 shadow priests, a specific meta gem to do top notch damage. At the time spriests were put into healer groups. Even still then, mages were strong but not brokenly overpowered. While mages have been relatively strong every expansion since then, at least know the history of the class before saying every patch of every expansion....because that's just not true.</div></div><hr />

That said, I'm also glad Overwatch was such a roaring success, but the damage seems to be done.<br />
<br />
As a DK main, GC's insights are extremely illuminating to me. One of the things that makes me sad:<br />
<br />
<br />
7) It was also really important to me to involve the community. The only way I knew how to develop (from my decade working on Age of Empires) was to constantly ask players what was working and what needed work. The early DK community was awesome. They were overall really level-headed, open-minded and defaulted to trust, and I think this experience led to them feeling some level of ownership over the class rather than it strictly being something we passed down to them.<br />
<br />
This is something that is missing from WoW today. Hell, I remember all the back and forth I had with GC on my paladin at the time and while nobody was happy with &quot;TO THE GROUND&quot; we knew it needed to be done, and Paladins were overall the best they have ever been in Wrath largely due to the work of this guy. GC signified the cornerstone of communication with the community at arguably its peak. <br />
<br />
The fact that the direct line between dev and player has been essentially shut down at this point speaks volumes to the discontent of the player base, especially with the widespread 7.1.5 nerfs. We don't mind getting nerfed, just tell us WHY. Say &quot;with Nighthold gear you will be performing too well&quot; or &quot;We don't like the way this mechanic is working, so how can we reach a compromise?&quot; Don't corral players into making petitions and cancelling subs to see impactful changes. Just. Ask. Listen. COMMUNICATE.<br />

What I linked are from the WClogs 90th percentile data you tool. Do you not even recognize WClogs? Can you not read what it says at the top? They aren't sims. They're the average of actual logs from the top performances on each fight you complete and utter numpty. <br />
<br />
What you linked is just A fight. I don't know which fight. One fight is not data. It's just A fight. I have no point of reference. Probably Xavius because you can cheese the tentacles like fuck. There also are no frost mages in what you just linked, which really doesn't help your argument that &quot;even their worst spec is better than DH, DK&quot;. because what you just linked doesn't demonstrate that.</div></div><hr />

i think the lesson here is balance - don't go down the rabbit hole too deep, keep connections to the outside world, and step out on a regular basis. I work in a pretty stressful job that deals with hardcore deadlines, I get it - and that's what I've done for years - leave work AT WORK, and don't spend more time there than necessary, and do things outside of work unrelated to it - even if it's video games.<br />
<br />
Totally agree. And ironically, our education system pushes the opposite mentality -- that is, to bring whatever unfinished work you have home with you and lose yourself in it for several hours every night, regardless of how stressful it is. What a healthy agenda to push.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the mini-rant. lol</div></div><hr />

With Blizzard being his life for so many years and having Titan dissolve right in front of him, it must have taken a lot to hold it together for Overwatch and see it through. I hope that he recovers and finds his passion again so that we can see more of his great work.</div></div><hr />

Many people seem to confuse this a lot, I know because Im that kind of person that acts normally around other people but I need to be alone to recharge my energy. Also I dont enjoy being around strangers but I act polite and do small talk and many others do aswell. Introverts can and do act like everyone else, we just dont enjoy being surrounded by strangers.</div></div><hr />

Death and Decay was a Lich ability in WC3, and it was never given to Warlocks in WoW.<br />

Death and Decay was never a Warlock ability, so you're right. He's probably talking about Death Coil; however, Death and Decay was a Death Knight ability in Warcraft II (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Death_and_Decay).<br />
<br />
It was a Lich ability in Warcraft III as noted.</div></div><hr />

Overwatch is whats left after they scrapped &quot;Titan&quot;. From earlier reports and stuff it was said to be a FPS MMORPG and when they scrapped it they took the pieces and made Overwatch</div></div><hr />

The thing is society at large hears 'panic attack' and think that, just because it has the word 'panic' in it it's nothing serious. I had to leave a job because I was in 'crunch' mode 24/7 and it eventually ate away into a panic attack, which everyone around me was utterly dismissive of. <br />
<br />
Leaving that job was the best thing that ever happened.</div></div><hr />

Warlock and Death Knight were the same thing in WC2. Death Knights were just &quot;zombie warlocks&quot;. WC3 retconned all that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Death Knight<br />
<br />
These soldiers of darkness were created by Gul'dan to replace the slaughtered warlock clans. Assembled from the corpses of the Knights of Azeroth slain in the last battles of the First War, these abominations were then instilled with the ethereal essence of the Shadow Council. Further empowered with magical energies culled from the slain necrolytes, the Death Knights wield an arsenal of necromantic and elemental spells that mete out all but certain death to the enemies of the Horde. &quot;</div></div><hr />

Thrall feeling like he was needed so much and was overwhelmed with having to be the leader that can't fail his people, when all he wanted was to pass the torch and be able to settle down with his family? He even passed down Doomhammer because he felt he was no longer worthy of it and knew the hero shaman could surpass him. At the very least, it is an interesting theory :)</div></div><hr />

There was a leak shortly after it cancelled where some beans were spilled. It's basically the same Overwatch &quot;Pixar Incredibles style&quot; setting except you controlled a custom superhero (as well as their normal alter ego, like Batman &amp; Bruce Wayne) while the ones in the current Overwatch game right now were NPC's you interacted with. <br />
<br />
There were actually two MMO's in one, a mundane world where you did simple tasks like work at a job, craft stuff, go on simple quests and play Facebook-style games basically do all the normal things your WoW character does when not in a raid. Then there was a raiding game where you play as your superhero in a fantastic world that existed beneath the veil of the mundane world, as part of the Overwatch, you would get called to handle things. It was all set in real-world locations. The raids were 1st person team shooter style.<br />
<br />
When Titan was cancelled, they basically took all the existing assets and built a TF2 style game around it which is why they were able to do it in about 2 years.</div></div><hr />

It's possible that he meant Death Coil and just wrote the name wrong.</div></div><hr />
