Blizzard released 2 official previews of the Patch 4.2 Raid and Patch 4.2 Daily Quests Area! We finally have a decent idea of what to expect there and seeing the zones (and Ragnaros :D) outside of the datamining environment is refreshing.

<br />
1) If they put it out in a month, or even two, why not bundle it with 4.1's content and flood the playerbase with all sorts of new stuff to keep us busy for a long time?<br />
2) If they put it out in more than two months (what I was expecting) then these previews are just really early.<br />
3) Did they put out 4.1 to test balance changes, in preparation for further balancing of 4.2? Do they want to have balance juuuuuust right for Firelands? Is this Ulduar 2.0, but they want to avoid the raiding problems of Ulduar's timing?<br />

They want us to have something to look forward to and feel aniticipated about. Also ZA/ZG would have been forgotten and ignored by the players if they released all at the same time .</div></div><hr />

2) If they put it out in more than two months (what I was expecting) then these previews are just really early.<br />
3) Did they put out 4.1 to test balance changes, in preparation for further balancing of 4.2? Do they want to have balance juuuuuust right for Firelands? Is this Ulduar 2.0, but they want to avoid the raiding problems of Ulduar's timing?<br />
4) Am I looking way too much into this? Most likely. Looks great though, from any perspective.<br />
<br />
1) Short answer: Because it's not done yet<br />
2) A lot of people are (or were) guessing 4.2 would follow swiftly after 4.1, so the timeframe does make sense<br />
3) I imagine that has a lot to do with it. 4.2 will inevitably contain balance changes, but the focus is on the new raid and daily areas<br />
4) Probably, and I conur<br />

There was a blue post a long time ago, went looking for it yesterday.. its on page 16 orso of this site... They put out 4.1 as Firelands was not ready and they did not want to hold back the content they felt was ready to be implemented. Thus, trying to introduce smaller patches more frequently than giant bundles on a larger time scale.</div></div><hr />

Guess on scale: there are two magmaws next to the bridge; if they're the same height ... O.O<br />
<br />
As for the 4.1 vs 4.2: also remember that Blizzard felt like it was too soon to put out Firelands based on current world raid progression. 4.1 with extra loot will help that along, as will the additional time before release.</div></div><hr />

People seem to think that fire+lava+slightly updated Rag (with totally new KJ skeleton) = badass. Personally, im not a big fan of fiery zones. The fire hawks definetley deserve animations of their own as they just look silly with the proto drake ones in my opinion. Granted the fights look interesting, but another than that I really don't see what warrants all these replies of &quot;omg i jizzed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also, seeing Fandral with an updated night elf male model makes me wonder when the new textures for player characters will be released. Orc males (Garrosh, Thrall), human male and females ( Varian and Jaina), blood elf females (Sylvanas), night elf males (Malfurion and now Fandral) and even naga males and females (seen pretty much everywhere there are naga mobs and npc's) all have updated textures. When will the rest of the races get theirs, and when will the players get them?</div></div><hr />

Too much fire in Firelands, you heard it here first, folks.<br />
<br />
I'm also still not seeing the KJ skeleton OR the worgen skeleton for Rag... as far as I can tell, it must be a totally new skeleton. Remember that he actually has to rise up out of the lava in the heroic encounter to boot. There's really no mobs at all in the game with an animation set capable of doing that which I can think of, which leads me to believe it's a new skeleton.</div></div><hr />

It looks like a lot of trash is missing in the video. There's almost no trash besides the double Magmaws leading up to Rag, no trash at all before Fanghorn in front of the gates, no trash leading to the spider boss... this is pretty obviously not complete. This is a preview. It's not really a stretch to assume a lot of props and doodads and particles are even missing still.</div></div><hr />

Nothing shockingly impressive really. If you turn off the music of the videos you see that the music does half the work for it. Waiting for more information on what 4.2 intends to bring, aside from raid and a new daily quest zoo.</div></div><hr />

I have to guess that one will drop in normal mode and one in heroic mode. Or maybe those will be the achievement drakes similar to glory to the raider. I'm not sure what they'll call it though because this tier isnt just firelands</div></div><hr />

It's not a phoenix, it's a firehawk. Also the model isn't final... And you can't honestly expect them to come up with brand new animations for every monster in the game.</div></div><hr />

I agree with this. That golem encounter looked bloody amazing and the zone just looks fantastic...<br />
<br />
People are looking at this and just thinking, &quot;Ah it's lava, we see lava all the time&quot;.... But honestly that is not the usual lava and fire effects. That Is incredible, the layout is perfect balance between fiery ground, mobs everywhere, cool models and lava. If you watched that trailer and went &quot;Meh&quot; ... Then I understand why you quit the game, and honestly what WILL it take to please you?<br />
<br />
If you don't like the game then you don't like the game, but you have to admit.... It looks bloody cool, and whilst their graphics may not be this &quot;Next Gen&quot; photo realistic, the models look incredible in WoW terms.</div></div><hr />

I can't really see how he can have KJ's skeleton and animations, since the heroic encounter will require Ragnaros to rise completely out of the lava and strut about, something KJ's animation and skeleton definitely did not allow for. :P</div></div><hr />

I'm not 100% sure but I dont think that firehawk was a boss...it seemed...to similar to the others. I figured if it was a boss it'd look different in some shape or form. I mean look at staghelm.

I think it's Raggy, Fandral, that dragon that was supposed to carry Fandral to Moonglade, Aeosura or something? Something about her and Firelands was data mined a bit back, then there's Aranae, Anthricyst, that proto-phoenix had more armor than the rest and wasn't flying, I think he'll probably be a boss. The fie elemental at 0:22-0:23 looks like Geddon (well...he looks like a lot of fire elementals), and I doubt you would have some trash at the top of a hill alone. And I wouldn't be surprised if they make a Flamewalker guy (Executus) a boss. So that's 8.<br />
<br />
And for the love of all that is holy people, if it has the same animations as another creature, it's a reMODEL. None of the things in there are reskins.</div></div><hr />

Hey buddy, you're preaching to the choir. I'm 100% fine with Blizz using recycled models since it's unrealistic to expect new models for everything. I was just commenting how it was a little disappointing how I immediately saw the proto-drake in the 'firehawk.'</div></div><hr />

Hey buddy, you're preaching to the choir. I'm 100% fine with Blizz using recycled models since it's unrealistic to expect new models for everything. I was just commenting how it was a little disappointing how I immediately saw the proto-drake in the 'firehawk.'<br />
<br />
It is kinda hard not to think of the proto-drakes when you watch them doing that awkward bat-crawl across the ground. I guess I expect a phoenix/firebirdbearpig to be graceful, and protos really aren't. Meh.</div></div><hr />

The majority of the environment seems to be sharp pointy rocks with pools of lava all around. Seriously, lets not be sheep that fawn all over Blizzard for any reason.<br />
<br />
The inside of Sulfuron Keep looks cool. The inside looks elaborately detailed and very nice. There are intricate textures and cool designs that make it seem like you are in a badass dungeon of some sort. But the outside area, which is the majority of the raid? The outside looks terrible. Just two or three textures used over and over. Rocks, lava, and fire. There is nothing, outside of Sulfuron Keep, that makes you feel like you are in a special place<br />
<br />
Remember how Ulduar made you feel? There were really cool envrionements in different areas of the dungeon. Different parts of the dungeon had different looks and feels. It felt massive, detailed, expansive, varied. Ulduar looked like nothing you had seen before in WoW and there was a sense of mystery and awe involved. The overwhelming majority of this dungeon looks like the Blasted Lands. I'm really not impressed.</div></div><hr />

8-9 months without any new raid content? I think not.<br />

4.2 will most likely hit the PTR within the next week or so, and will probably go live at the most two months from now.</div></div><hr />

Something about her and Firelands was data mined a bit back, then there's Aranae, Anthricyst, that proto-phoenix had more armor than the rest and wasn't flying, I think he'll probably be a boss. The fie elemental at 0:22-0:23 looks like Geddon (well...he looks like a lot of fire elementals), and I doubt you would have some trash at the top of a hill alone. And I wouldn't be surprised if they make a Flamewalker guy (Executus) a boss. So that's 8.<br />
<br />
And for the love of all that is holy people, if it has the same animations as another creature, it's a reMODEL. None of the things in there are reskins.<br />
<br />
It could be geddon or something similar but I doubt it. Maybe a guantlet mini-boss or something similar to thorim hallways, but if you go back at the front page and look it shows lord &quot;anthycryst&quot; or something similar to that thats probably just a trash mob or like I said a mini-boss. But yes now that you mention more armor on the firehawk it could be a boss but they didnt point out where so I'm not sure. <br />
<br />
It'd be nice to see another flamewalker boss. I think we need another council fight. I love council fights to death. So much fun in them</div></div><hr />

It honestly comes off like a fulfilling of what they feel is a mandatory stance they have to take. It's actually ok to like things, really.. just as equally so it's ok to dislike things.<br />
<br />
There is however something to be said when something you dislike is something you constantly return to. I've played tons of games I heavily dislike and I certainly don't spend my days on anything related to said games preaching to people who enjoy it how much I hate it.. <br />
<br />
Whatever happened to if you dislike something.. just don't bother with it? When did everything become a medium for people to scream about their dislikes.. who are you trying to convince? <br />
<br />
REGARDLESS. It's entertaining though it's probably more monotonous then any reskinned model, boring colors and &quot;meh&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Video looks pretty cool. Can't wait to see the finished product and moreso how the encounters will play out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW for the life of me it will never stop being hilarious to see people gripe about reskinning like it's something new. If you want uniqueness, don't play an MMO because it does not exist there.</div></div><hr />

When it became perfectly normal to walk around with a huge sense of entitlement and massive unwarranted self-importance. It didn't help when attention whoring via idiot raging became the new fad on and off the internet. Still, it's great to see all these morons foaming at the mouth while still being subbed to the very game they 'hate'.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I am guessing a month before it is live. 4.1 had a lot of system changes like Guildfinder, the tanking goodie bag, the new 7day vp system and a bunch of other stuff. 4.2 will probably just be the raid and dailies zone.</div></div><hr />

Apart from some cool-looking bosses, I find it rather disappointing. As someone else said - the looks of the building itself is ok. Rest is so underwhelming for me to be honest. I felt like I am in Wintergrasp, farming Motes of Fire. Same lava, same rocks, same elementals, I already mentioned about the RFC caverns, and just fed up with the fire environment in general. BWD was enough. Throne of the Four winds was such a breath of fresh air.</div></div><hr />

One Molten Core, one Blackwing Lair, twice (three times even) the Onyxia, Blackwing Descent, all of the Blackrock Mountain dungeons, half Bastion of Twilight (with some recolored fire), 4th time a recolored RFC caverns (seriously, seeing 1:1 RFC in a Dragonblight subzone was ridiculous) etc etc. It's kind of enough. And yes, of course Ragnaros is supposed to make an appearance in a fire raid but who says we want Ragnaros actually? Three times or so Kael'Thas, three times Onyxia, 2 times each of the Blood Princes, two times Nefarian, 2 times Naxx, 2 times recycled troll stuff, now 2nd time Ragnaros. It's getting a bit too much really. They need some fertile spores from Zangarmarsh for creativity.</div></div><hr />

No, almost certainly it will drop from Ragnaros. Remember that Ashes of Al'ar drops from Kael'thas, not from Al'ar. Mimiron's Head drops from Yogg, not from Mimiron. This is the exact same situation.</div></div><hr />

How many Skywall raids/places have you done? Let me guess - only the Cataclysm ones, because Skywall is a new environment.<br />
How many snowy raids/snow-themed raids have you done? One? WotlK? (if we don't count Winterspring).<br />
How many fire-based raids and places have you done? No, really, no need to answer, I took the time to list them for you...<br />
<br />
WotlK had too much snow - fine, it's only WotlK. Skywall has too much sky - cool, it's 1 zone.<br />
Fire? I started WoW with a 100% (! surprise) fire based raid. What did it continue with? A fire based raid. And what followed next? A fire-based raid. <br />
<br />
No need to be ironic, it's not working as intended...<br />
<br />
Oh, and just to add - I did sum up my 'rants', but I will clarify it a bit more for you and for a few other people - I don't mind a fire-based raid actually. I do mind when A) I see reskinned old mobs. B) I see reski... oh wait - THE SAME old boss. C) I see reskinned RFC instance that I fought in at level 14. Sorry but for the money Blizzard gets I expect a little bit more than just 5-6 models of a boss and a couple of textures for a nice-looking building to be released as the next &quot;OMG-tier&quot; of content.<br />

How many fire-based raids and places have you done? No, really, no need to answer, I took the time to list them for you...<br />
<br />
WotlK had too much snow - fine, it's only WotlK. Skywall has too much sky - cool, it's 1 zone.<br />
Fire? I started WoW with a 100% (! surprise) fire based raid. What did it continue with? A fire based raid. And what followed next? A fire-based raid. <br />
<br />
No need to be ironic, it's not working as intended...<br />
<br />
Oh, and just to add - I did sum up my 'rants', but I will clarify it a bit more for you and for a few other people - I don't mind a fire-based raid actually. I do mind when A) I see reskinned old mobs. B) I see reski... oh wait - THE SAME old boss. C) I see reskinned RFC instance that I fought in at level 14. Sorry but for the money Blizzard gets I expect a little bit more than just 5-6 models of a boss and a couple of textures for a nice-looking building to be released as the next &quot;OMG-tier&quot; of content.<br />

Sorry Rauk but WOW has a very simple mob system that gives very little potential for creating diffrent mobs than what have been ingame from day one. It is all gonna be reskinned until they get a better mob engine. And that will not happen next 5-6 years at least. So we have to live with it.<br />
<br />
WOW has been put in a permanent mold by BLizzard. It has grown stagnant and ppl will just have to realise that it gonna be like this. If you want something diffrent than wait for GW2 and SWTOR. Or go play around with souls in RIFTs. It very enjoyable compared to the lockdown specs in WOW.</div></div><hr />

To everyone NOT moaning - I look forward to seeing you in Firelands!</div></div><hr />

And it seems like Ragnaros upgraded his weapon now, smart choice, he woulda fail if he continued to use his lvl 60 legendary against us.<br />
Fandral's new model, made me changed my pants, he looks awesome!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look again, you see quite a few of them flying around.<br />
<br />
Also, every single raidboss that is a dragon has the same animations, from Ebon-something in BWL to Deathwing.<br />

<br />
However, I do not like the color palette of Firelands. Sure it's Fire-Lands, but that doesn't mean everything needs to be in the brown through red color spectrum. We got one green tree there. They could've made the zone look a lot more alive. Look at Twilight Highlands it has shit loads of color, yet you still see scars with purple/shadow fire/magic spilling out of them, which makes the zone look scared and dangerous. Similar stuff could be done for Firelands and it would not look so bland.<br />
<br />
I guess not many will agree, but it looks bland to me, bosses are fine, the whole picture of the zone is bland tho - it really feels like I'm in Molten Core again and I didn't like Molten Core from the get go as it had no detail no nothing, just a tunnel of lava with mobs inside.<br />

Those were the first 3 raids of WoW and they were all Fiery :D</div></div><hr />

Just lol. I don't even know how to respond to this. You think Firelands is a &quot;reskinned&quot; RFC? K. You can think that. I'm sure you won't ever have to worry about seeing it because you're either not an active subscriber or are still wiping in the cata heroics.<br />
<br />
P.S. We're fighting Ragnaros again because we never actually killed him; we banished him back to the Firelands. He can only die in this elemental plane.<br />

Out of the 19 or so raid instances, 6 of them are fire themed. That's not even a solid majority.</div></div><hr />

I am not saying Firelands is a reskinned RFC. I am saying many things in Firelands in general are reskinned old things. Play the daily quests area preview movie and you'll see the RFC reskinned. Same as people see reskinned (re-skeletoned, lol) protodrakes in Firehawks. It's cool to describe my character based on a post, though! I am just in awe because of how 'accurate' the description is...<br />
<br />
P.S. And why were we fighting everything in Naxxramas, Onyxia, Nefarian, Kael'Thas, Nalorakk and the other Zul'XXX bosses? Cool logic. So if Blizzard introduces a very powerful magician that is able to resurrect Onyxia 25 times so that she's the final boss in every single raid instance for the next 3 years, you'll accept it as lore-supported and logical? I don't know what to say to that, really...</div></div><hr />
