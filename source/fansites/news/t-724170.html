Korean World of Warcraft Beta Contest<br />

<br />
After poking around on Twitter I finally found someone willing to translate the important part (thanks Kyiran! (http://www.mmo-champion.com/profile/?u=4152)). <br />

As a gift we will select 1000 people who participate and send them an invitation to participate in the World of Warcraft Closed Beta Test.<br />
<br />
Announcement and Confirmation of the Winners Method<br />
&#45817;&#52392;&#51088; &#48156;&#54364; &#51068;&#51221; : 6&#50900; 15&#51068; &#50724;&#54980;<br />
Winners will be announced on the 15th of June in the afternoon<br />
&#52488;&#45824;&#44428; &#48156;&#49569; &#51068;&#51221; &#48143; &#54869;&#51064; &#48169;&#48277; : &#45817;&#52392;&#46104;&#49888; &#52488;&#45824;&#44428;&#51008; &#54620;&#44397; &#48708;&#44277;&#44060; &#48288;&#53440; &#53580;&#49828;&#53944;&#51032; &#51068;&#51221;&#50640; &#47582;&#52628;&#50612;, &#50900;&#46300; &#50724;&#48652; &#50892;&#53356;&#47000;&#54532;&#53944; &#44277;&#49885; &#54856;&#54168;&#51060;&#51648;&#51032; [&#44228;&#51221; &#44288;&#47532;] &gt; [&#50864;&#54200;&#54632;]&#51012; &#53685;&#54644; &#44060;&#48324;&#51201;&#51004;&#47196; &#48156;&#49569;&#46112; &#50696;&#51221;&#51077;&#45768;&#45796;.<br />
This part is a bit more difficult but it's basically about confirming participation at the official website via your mailbox (forum inbox?) (where you recieve the invitation) in the &quot;Korean&quot; closed beta test. It specificies the beta test as &quot;korean&quot; here where it doesn't elsewhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
<br />
This could be a fairly interesting information, especially because of the timing. <br />
<br />
There is a beta contest, and winners will supposedly be announced on June 15th.<br />
As far as I know, there is a WoW Press Tour @ Blizzard HQ this week for official fansites.<br />
5 Screenshots on the Day have been uploaded on Blizzard's site before the week-end. (= until Tuesday)<br />
<br />
Don't get your hopes too high, especially since the korean page also clearly states that it doesn't mean that the beta will start on June 15th but the timing is definitely interesting and I will live in the hope of a beta/NDA lift for the rest of the week.<br />
<br />

Comics<br />
This week we have Dark Legacy Comic #241 (http://www.darklegacycomics.com/241.html), Teh Gladiators #138 + #139 (http://www.tehgladiators.com/?p=138) and a follow-up of last week's comic with Questionable Content #1680 (http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1680). <br />

Players who leave a message about &quot;How's your expectation of Catacylsm&quot; or &quot;Why you think you are qualified to be a Beta tester.&quot; in the thread on the forum would have a chance to join the Beta.<br />
<br />
The result will be announced a little bit earlier than Korea, on 12th June.<br />

Its a little bit offtopic but connecting to Blizzard and to the closed beta so...my question is:<br />
Why the hell i find a Blizzard email in my junk every single day ? I have only a free trial account :(...so..i dont think that i should get tons of emails from Blizzard.<br />
Today i got an email about BETA invitation...Im suspicious :S.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the offtopic post and for my bad english XD!<br />

<br />
The Korean contest page is still referring to the beta test as &quot;closed&quot; so I doubt it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Closed Beta doesn't have a NDA. The meaning &quot;Closed&quot; is referred to as you can only be invited. If it were &quot;Open&quot; then you could join as you please.</div></div><hr />

Anywho, shouldn't be any different from the day Ulduar went live. Most servers went up and down like a basketball for at least 2 days. Actually setting aside 1 whole day to do maintenance may give more hope for post-maintenance stability.... if not increase the instability twofold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Boubouille, The beta is starting in the next two weeks or so. There should be anofficial press release this week, or a &quot;blue&quot; may let something slip on the blizzard forums ;-)<br />
<br />
Let me give you some &quot;hints below&quot;<br />
<br />
Expansion patches are usually released in November(Vanilla WOW, Wotlk, Burning crusade got pushed back till January, but should of been released in November), phase 1 public Beta is usually &quot;exactly&quot; 6 months before the scheduled release date (+/- 3 days).<br />
<br />
so June 15 - November 15 *HINT*<br />
<br />
Phase 2 public beta in July is when the majority of invites will go out<br />
<br />
If your lucky you will get a June invite, the Majority of Beta invites will Be July, this is needed for stress testing as there is a lead time if more hardware has to be provisioned in the data centres.<br />
<br />

<br />
Then again it is the old world, which is completely changed in Cataclysm and was nearly untouched for the last 5 years, guess this maintenance will cover some issues.<br />

While I don't disagree that beta sounds likely to be released that month (even though I won't claim it to be anything more than a hunch based on the apparent progression of the alpha) I don't think a sample of 3 past occurrences is quite enough to use the word &quot;usually&quot;.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly it. Kind of a 'tell'.<br />
<br />
Aside from Blizzard stating what's going to happen in the blue.<br />
<br />
We will be performing extended maintenance on the realms listed below on Tuesday, June 8th, beginning at 12:01 AM PDT. The maintenance is scheduled for 24 hours AS WE PREPARE FOR THE UPCOMING EXPANSION. These realms will be playable again at approximately 12:01 AM PDT on Wednesday, June 9th.<br />

Blizz said they're putting in the new battle.net this week and pre-downloading the new raid content however the new raid won't be active until they do the same maint on EU realms next week. I guess this is a HUGE change to the bnet underpinnings and they want to focus all effort on getting it done right.<br />
<br />
I'm curious though if the new quests will be delayed until EU patch rollout as well.</div></div><hr />

the beta has begun already, its just friends and family etc, the beta is run in phases so as i said the majority will be in July (which is 5 months from the november release) Invites will go out in june, just not as many as people are expecting, ther server clusters need tuning ;-) <br />

Maybe they will lift the NDA as the servers go down for the 24 hour maintenance so that they aren't responsible for millions of deaths? Fingers crossed as well 8)</div></div><hr />

Unless I'm mistaken they did this last time as well, in order to get the servers ready for the massive changes that an expansion brings. They need to do this for all realms so it's just a matter of time really if your not affected at the moment. No worries, it's nice weather right now so I'll be in the garden with a cool beer and a bbq. :)<br />
<br />
Wondering how the beta start will play out and yeah, hoping for an end to nda.</div></div><hr />

There should be anofficial press release this week, or a &quot;blue&quot; may let something slip on the blizzard forums ;-)<br />
<br />
Let me give you some &quot;hints below&quot;<br />
<br />
Expansion patches are usually released in November(Vanilla WOW, Wotlk, Burning crusade got pushed back till January, but should of been released in November), phase 1 public Beta is usually &quot;exactly&quot; 6 months before the scheduled release date (+/- 3 days).<br />
<br />
so June 15 - November 15 *HINT*<br />
<br />
Phase 2 public beta in July is when the majority of invites will go out<br />
<br />
If your lucky you will get a June invite, the Majority of Beta invites will Be July, this is needed for stress testing as there is a lead time if more hardware has to be provisioned in the data centres.<br />
<br />
<br />
Scorge<br />
<br />
<br />
You're a raging idiot if you honestly believe Cataclysm is coming out in November.<br />
<br />
Patch 4.0 in September. Expansion launch in October before BlizzCon.</div></div><hr />

I agree with this, they won't release after Blizzcon. What would be the point? Tell you all about the game JUST before launch. It'll be before Blizzcon and Blizzcon will be previewing the first major content patch for Cata</div></div><hr />

<br />
It stands to reason that they are doing a major hardware upgrade over the downtime. While the outage is bothersome, the end result should be positive.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mordras</div><div class="date">2010-06-07, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the blue post is from the US forums and it does not indicate if its world wide or not. So perhaps its just US or EU are going to announce soon. <br />
<br />
When has there ever been an announcement of European maintenance on the US forums? It wouldn't make any sense to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the beta has begun already, its just friends and family etc, the beta is run in phases so as i said the majority will be in July (which is 5 months from the november release) Invites will go out in june, just not as many as people are expecting, ther server clusters need tuning ;-) <br />
<br />
That's called Alpha. And once again your math is off. June is 5 months from November and July is 4 months.<br />

Aren't you the guy that claimed that the Beta would start 2 weeks after they reminded people how to opt into Beta? Your reasoning seemed to be that 2 weeks was the amount of time from the Wrath opt-in to the start of the Wrath Beta. That reminder of the opt-in for the Cataclysm beta was 3 1/2 weeks ago, still no Beta.</div></div><hr />

This man is wise. Roll a matching-faction Death Knight and get yourself a few gold for repair and cheap greens from the AH to send over to your level 5, as your DK levels through Hellfire, your toon levels through the pre-teens,...10s, 20s, and so on. in 12 hours, given a few hour breaks here and there, I had a day off so I tried to see how far I could get a simple little pally in one day (12 hrs not 24) got him just shy of 21.

OMG, my prediction was off. I am destroyed.<br />
<br />
Wrath beta was ~3 months long. (beta download became available on July 18th, patch 3.0 was in October) So the beta starting anytime in the next few weeks means patch 4.0 in September. This assumes no severe delays and that the beta will last about the same time as the last two expansion betas did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me too, the very earliest comics occasionally contain some really arcane references to indie and alt rock that can make them a bit hard to follow, but the author quickly gets over that and comes through with a pretty decent character driven story. Watching the art develop is fun too. It starts off a step or two above stick figures and slowly develops into the style you see in the linked comics. <br />
<br />
Edit to add: The obscure Indy and Alt rock references also caused me check out several new bands that I quite like, so I can't complain too much.</div></div><hr />

While his math is all kinds of screwed up, you're wrong on one point. It IS currently in a &quot;Friends and Family&quot; stage of Beta. Although, 'beta' and 'alpha' doesn't mean much. But it is considered an early beta phase this time around.</div></div><hr />

You've clearly never done a full hardware/software upgrade on a server cluster. You can't do this stuff in hour or two dribs and drabs across a week or two. You take it all down, do the upgrades and test. If you've got the brains of a fruit fly, you leave yourself wiggle room for the inevitable problems. You fix the inevitable problems and test some more. Once you're confident that everything works you bring it all back online. Depending on what they're doing it may be that upgrade itself will take a long time. For instance, if they're migrating the main databases to new hardware you're talking about probably terabytes of data that will have move across the network. <br />
<br />
There's all know of redundancy, reliability, and such you can build into a computing cluster, but for some things they just have to come down for a bit. When reliability is the only standard by which you're judged there are ways to perform such upgrades &quot;real time&quot;, but they would be prohibitively expensive for the numbers of servers Blizz has running this game, and frankly it's not anyone's life or death whether the servers are unavailable for a day.</div></div><hr />

We raid Mon/Tue/Wed from 930st to 1230st, so Mon raid is cut short by just a bit (which really sucks because we finally got back LK after wasting a couple weeks on 8/12 HM) and Tue raid probably won't happen.<br />

Bad Timing :'(</div></div><hr />
