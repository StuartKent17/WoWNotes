Ghostcrawler confirmed the news on the official forums.<br />
You know that part at the end of raid night when the final boss is dead and you’re done handing out loot and everyone kind of goes their separate ways? Yeah, this is one of those times.<br />
<br />
We just came off of a great BlizzCon. We had so many different games to talk about, and we were thrilled at the reception of Warlords of Draenor. It was great to meet or reconnect with so many of you. I love BlizzCon dearly, which makes it so hard to tell you that this will be my last one, or at least my last one up on stage. An opportunity has come my way, and I have made the very tough decision to move on from Blizzard.<br />
<br />
I wanted to thank all of you for being a part of this grand quest. I have said a hundred times that having passionate gamers, including the angry ones, is a far better place to be than having a community that doesn’t care. You all care. Like us, you want the game to be the best that it can be. So I ask you to keep on providing your feedback. I promise (and I rarely promise!) that the developers care very much about what you have to say.<br />
<br />
I’ll be out there, and I can’t imagine it will be that hard to find me.<br />
<br />
Hugs,<br />
Ghostcrawler<br />
<br />
P.S. No, you can’t have a pony. Or a moose. Or a mantis shrimp. Or a tardigrade. Or a crab. Keep trying though.<br />
<br />
P.P.S. I play a Holy Priest.</div></div><hr />

If you want to be taken seriously (Which im assuming you arent based on this post) you should probably stop thinking it hinges on one person. <br />
Also, quality is in the eyes of the community which is just horrid, who are also never happy.</div></div><hr />

Twenty years in the software industry, and having done this maneuver myself, says... you don't have the slightest clue what you're talking about.<br />

I don't think anyone here are fan boys, Greg has been one of the only developers that actually spoke with his community so some people are going to miss the guy. He was a integral part of WoW's design in some areas, so its kinda like losing a piece in the puzzle.</div></div><hr />

Because you can tell how fun I am in person by my opinions on a game developer. Being so opinionated and quick to react makes you the more likely culprit of being a douche.<br />
<br />
And by the by, Kalgan did too. GC is nothing special...in ever sense of the phrase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not like he died, chill out. As someone who was there when Kalgan passed the torch to a person who aided in the downfall of the game I loved I am legitimately very excited to see what the future has in store. Disagree? That's nice. Deal with it.<br />
<br />
1. I disagree, but you have the brains of a mentally challenged Orangutan so it won't matter.<br />
2. GC Did a fine job.<br />
3. You are probably one of those people who are so stuck in nostalgia they can't see the forest for the trees.</div></div><hr />

Your opinion was more focused on the people who were sad he was leaving NOT on the developer, which you falsely state. People are entitled to their opinion and can think what they want. <br />

Lets say you are moving and you have a kid, he comes crying to you that he will be leaving all of his friends behind.<br />

Since you seem convinced that his departure was involuntary, surely we'll see reversals on a lot of recent decisions, even those announced at BlizzCon, right?<br />

For whatever happens, we - as a community - should not and hopefully will not forget what he's done for the game and the effort &amp; passion he's put into it. Azeroth will not be the same for him.<br />

Though, truth be told: I wonder what the buzz is in Blizzard HQ about it all. I hope this went over well there and with the people in the know.</div></div><hr />

01 - He surely doesn't, but one less of those that made the game decline (in subs, quality, and more) for the past 4 years<br />
02 - Ok, I should rephrase that: BYE BYE PRIEST HATER!<br />
03 - I made an account to post on the topic of KJ vs LK the other day, although it's not of your business<br />
04 - People like me that have been playing for the past 9 years are not the reason WoW is in a decline, WoW is in a decline because of the decisions GC team made over the past 4-5 years, so NO don't blame it on me, cause I don't design anything!</div></div><hr />

Sure, the guy who played a healer hated healers. <br />
<br />
[[BUT IM SURE HE WAS JUST SAYING HE PLAYED A HEALER AS COVER ON HIS WAY OUT TO PREVENT THE MOBS FROM GETTING HIM NOW THAT HES JUST A PRIVATE CITIZEN AGAIN]]<br />
<br />
I had my issues with some of GC's design logic but, as a healer main, I never had issues with his team's designs for healers. Well, ironically, except his liking of the Chakra mechanic. ;)</div></div><hr />

I'm of the mind that the game wouldn't be anywhere close to as balanced (of all the MMO's I've played it's easily the MOST balanced out there) without him. He's done an amazing job, and everyone out there that bashes him couldn't do a better job in a million years.</div></div><hr />

What is wrong with the state of the game oh wise one? Highest subscription MMO out there. Highest long term subs of any MMO ever. Only lost 100k subs last quarter on a 10 year old game. I would much rather be developing for Rift and nearly go out of business only to be forced into F2P with no guaranteed source of revenue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the regular joe, yes, but for a big name like Ghostcrawler, no. If he was pushed out of the company, of course they would allow him to say his goodbyes as he's been a face of WoW for so many years that many people know and would be wondering what happened to. I hope he is truly moving on to bigger and better things for himself and that it was his decision to leave.</div></div><hr />

You know GC was in charge of class design and tradeskills. Considering class balance is the closest it has ever been I'd say they did a good job.<br />

If he hated healers so much then why are the healing specs so even now? Wouldn't shamans be nerfed to the ground still?</div></div><hr />

Pretty much. We probably won't see a change in design for another year or so as WoD is at least a year off and the next patch won't come more than 2 months before that. On top of that, if the next Lead Designer follows GC's footprints, then nothing changes. Or we get a Lead Design that makes wide sweeping changes that nobody likes.<br />
<br />
My bet is that everybody that dislikes GC is only happy because there is change. Honestly, its one person in the cog, although that person is a very large and viewable cog.</div></div><hr />

There is only one course of action for you. His position is open. Stop posting on this forum right now and get your application in to Blizzard right away. Make sure you provide them with all your proof on how your designs will bring back all the masses.<br />

<br />
WoW being a different game as the years have gone on is a good thing. I can't imagine this game being like vanilla or BC year after year. That would get so ridiculously boring and repetitive. Blizzard is always trying to mix things up to keep the game fresh and different. Some things I've loved, some, not so much, but at least they're trying different things. :)</div></div><hr />

The next in line has some big shoes to fill and I think we all have to agree: Players that complain and players that love all have one common thing - we care about the game. Having someone listen is better, 1000 times better, than having developers make blind decisions.<br />

I guess he spends allot of time as the authority figure in the day so just wants to relax and sit back while gaming. Hence the healing role. <br />
<br />
Sad to see the guy go, he has made good and bad choices but lets not forget im sure those bad choices were not just his own and many voted them through in the first place. Hell i bet most the bad stuff was not his choice anyway he was just trying to make it smooth as possible. <br />

Some things don't change.<br />
<br />
Mad props to GC though, hes done an awesome job really, its no small achievement keeping a game that is almost 10 years old feeling fresh and still coming up with new experiences for players that they haven't had yet. And its no small achievement having such a huge and healthy subscriber base for an MMO thats almost 10 years old either, a feat no other game has managed to match, so kudos where kudos are due. Even outside of his talent as a designer though, he deserves credit for weathering the storm of bullshit he must cop from players on a daily basis, dude must have some seriously thick skin.</div></div><hr />
