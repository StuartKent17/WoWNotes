Class balance<br />
Rogues are getting balanced, other classes too. Rogues should read the original post (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=450715166), it should let them know what kind of change they can expect.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of valid concerns and thoughts inhere, so I would like to blue-tag this thread just to let you know we have both seen and read this thread. Most of the things posted inhere have been forwarded to the developers already, and some of the things have already been commented in other threads both on these forums and the US forums.<br />
<br />
It is taking time indeed, but for a good reason. Many classes are getting adjusted, not just Rogues, so time is required in order to make sure that things are done properly. <br />
<br />
Balancing classes in a game like World of Warcraft is not a small task, so I am afraid that patience is something you will have to stock up on at least to a certain degree.<br />

<br />
<br />
The abundance of high resiliance floating in arena (even in lower brackets) coupled with the buffing of the PvP trinket has put a severe crimp in rogues' key two necessities to win, CC/Stunlocks and high burst damage. The environment as it stands is practically forcing us to go Combat-Mace to stand a chance in 5v5. Rogues need some fixing in the PvP/Arena department, but knowing Blizzard, they'll just overpower Cloak of Shadows even more and ignore our legitimate concerns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
rogues aren't that hard to beat only if you know how to.<br />
simple thing you keep them busy or away. As a rogue i dont have a problem with Most of the things out there but recently im just hearing how &quot;overpowered&quot; rogues are when infact they are not.<br />
<br />
stuns? what can we really do without stuns? <br />
do we get any buffs? combat shout or something else? poisons are our buffs. crippling poison is just so we dont have to chase you because 80% of the time when i got a runner/kiter.... i will be right on top of them but it keeps saying &quot;target is too far away...&quot;<br />
healers? yeh ok umm how many time have you ever seen a &quot;PRIEST&quot; healer?? 90% of the time its a pally or a druid. Im with a warlock in 2 vs 2 team and we (warlock + felguard and me) sat there and tried to kill a pally for 4 mins even after the mana burn till he finally gave up and im sorry if im not a super duper epiced out rogue with 90dps daggers.<br />
<br />
druids - is what you call over powered. why? they infinte of basically everything. if the druid is well GEARED then no matter how hard you try you can't bring them down because of the shape shift/healing and what not.<br />
<br />
Hunters - is what you call over powered. why? Their wing clips crit for 1k avg. They can hit from halway across the map for avg for 500/sec along with perma pet which hits for 250-500. They can put a dot similar to warlock's. They can put a poison similar to rogues. &quot;zomg but we got a dead zone&quot;..... yeh right. If they got someone else selected whos not in the dead zone which is a 90% probability they can scatter shot 3 people most of the time for 2500. last but not least they dont need los.<br />
<br />
warlock overpowered? naw because fear is dead in arena because by the time avg warlock is about to fear, he/she is either dead or can't cast is because someone is hitting them. death coil is all they got but never really seen a warlock last more than 15 seconds in 2vs2 or 3 vs 3<br />
<br />
^^^<br />
if you dont agree with that PERSONALLY i would think your a retard. Idc if you think im whining or a retard ...because I think what i pointed out is nothing compared to what rogues can do. Yes combat rogues have nice dps but they only get 1 chance to &quot;tear&quot; someone apart and if that fails they i think they pretty much lost the fight.<br />
<br />
but it all comes down to 1 thing... which is healing - which wasn't designed for pvp. even just 1 heal can change the outcome of any battle. now think about that pally which heals any class for 5k+. what you going to do? start attacking the pally? oh wait they can become god for 11 seconds. pvp can't be balanced because this is a pve designed game. You need those big heals for bosses in raids/instances.<br />
ty for reading my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1k wingclip?<br />
<br />
Highest Rank:<br />
Inflicts 50 damage and reduces the enemy target's movement speed by 60% for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
Nice one kid, please research before throwing out random false facts..<br />
<br />
Sublety and Assassination Rogues are still good for Arenas as well, any rogue thats worth their weight will know how to play, and can dominate the enemy healers and casters, if they use their abilities wisely..<br />
<br />
For one, a rogue isn't just for damage, if you want raw damage you take a mage or hunter, you use a rogue for utility, for knocking out enemy healers, for sap, for constant interruption, for slaughtering priests, and for their poisons. Their poisons are versatile enough to be worth it, you can slow cast time, reduce healing (mortal strike almost), apply dots, instant nature damage (who needs armor?), and have one of the best slows in the game.<br />
<br />
I can understand complaints versus paladins, everyone has them, but overall bringing a rogue is worth it, with the ability to mortal strike and increase casting time, the opposing healers are in a bit of a rough (druid healers especially)<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=8946<br />
^-- 13% of their base mana to cleanse ONE poison.<br />
<br />
Rogues are fine in 5v5<br />
<br />
And I quote the Govinator &quot;Stop whining&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coconuter</div><div class="date">2007-08-16, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I laugh at the people that think only sub and assassination rogues are good for arena. Especially in 5v5. Sub rogues are just a sudden burst, if they dont kill in that burst they are useless. Assassination rogues have a good amount of dps for a suspeneded amount of time with a good starting stunlock.<br />
<br />
Any class spec can play, and to leave out combat rogues for 5v5 is something to laugh at. Combat rogues that pop AR and Blade flurry will put out so much dps to 1 if not 2 (usually 2 in a 5v5 situation) targets at the same time for an extended time period. This causes a lot of disruption and is incredibly hard to heal for that time period.<br />
<br />
Sub is for the unskilled class that relies on burning of cooldowns to do much at all. Once they are out of stealth for a couple of seconds they become walking stunners and weak damage that is easy to heal through and something to not worry about.<br />
<br />
I don't think people should say only these specs are good for arena or pvp. Those are just the specs that take the least skill and timing to work with and make eleven year olds worth something.</div></div><hr />

Hello, I'm playing a hunter and I would need a few advices from you.<br />
<br />
I'm still trying to obtain &quot;1k avg.&quot; wing clips but so far my crit record is 170 (not 170k, just plain 170). But that's maybe because I'm using that lame Legacy two-hander.<br />
<br />
Also I would like to find the &quot;dot similar to warlock's&quot; in my talent tree or spell book as it seems quite appealing. The &quot;poison similar to rogues&quot; sounds good too, do I have to do a quest at level 20 to get such poisons?<br />
<br />
Another interesting hunter feature I missed is the ability to &quot;scatter shot 3 people most of the time for 2500&quot;. My scatter shot only affect single targets, is halfway in the marksmanship tree and does 50% weapon damage. How can I obtain the one you mention? Is it from that eBay place everyone is talking about?<br />
<br />
&quot;Last but not least&quot; indeed, hunters &quot;dont need los&quot;. Again, I didn't find a talent or spell called homing missile on my character, do I need to search for a different name?<br />
<br />
Thanks for you knowledge and patience.</div></div><hr />

This is just hilarious. I'm sorry to be the third person quoting and tearing this apart, but I have to...<br />
<br />
Wing clip is a horrendously weak attack. It's not even meant to hurt the opponent, just slow them so you can regain range (which can frequently fail if a warrior is spamming Hamstring on you, as you are slowed along with him.)<br />
<br />
Average 500 DPS + 250-500 pet DPS? How many talent points do you think hunters get to spend, as this would require going deep into two trees. I'm not excellently geared &amp; I'm far from the best hunter for sure, but I know how to play and in a raid where I can stand still and work my best shot rotation with my pet in there doing his thing, our combined DPS ranges from 500-800, depending on crits. Now in PvP, you have to keep moving, breaking the shot rotation concept and killing any chance at max DPS, yes you can get an occasional Steady Shot, &amp; should be able to Multi-shot (not scatter, gawd that's annoying, why can't anyone keep those two names straight?) whenever it's CD is up, but that DPS is definitely reduced, especially with crits suffering from opponents' resilience. &amp; smart arena teams handle pets with CC.<br />
<br />
lock dot? rogue poison? perhaps you mean Serpent Sting (for both?) LOWEST DAMAGE DOT IN THE GAME, and it's a poison, so it can be cleared by anyone (it's called First Aid, train it)... maybe the rogue poison you mention is the poisons generated by our snake trap snakes? wonderful toy, but a single AoE burst (AE, FN, BW, etc.) kills them ALL.<br />
<br />
Finally, as I pointed above, it's Multi-Shot that hits 3 targets (if they're close enough to each other) and base damage is going to be around 1k or a little higher. Sure it can crit to nearly 3k on any or all targets, but this is PvP... with resilience, reduced crits &amp; reduced crit damage.<br />
<br />
Hunters are not OP in Arenas, certainly not in 5v5.</div></div><hr />
