Volley removed<br />
I know I'm going to regret posting in this thread again, but I think it's the right thing to do so I'll take one for the team. :)<br />
<br />
We think Multi-Shot is a more interesting ability and can fill the hunter AE niche (along with Explosive Trap). We'll have to change Multi-Shot from the current version to get it there. I'm very sorry if for some unusual reason Volley was your favorite spell as a hunter. We've been trying to consolidate abilities and free up some bar space and having multiple AEs that competed with each other seems like a good area to hit up. The Volley and Multi-Shot niches were very similar, which resulted in the latter being dead. We wanted to pick one and we though Multi-Shot felt more huntery and less &quot;clunky&quot; (to use a favorite Wow forums term).<br />
<br />
Do consider that you won't be AE'ing yourselves through Cataclysm content the way you do currently. When you do need to AE, hunters will have the tools to do so. In situations where you do have to AE, you are probably not also trying to CC. When you're back to the level of trivializing lower level content, nobody is going to say &quot;Don't bring a hunter. Their AE spam isn't spammy enough.&quot; We don't consider easily breaking rogues out of stealth a good reason to keep Volley around.<br />
<br />
I think that hits most of the reasonable concerns. I care much less about addressing the unreasonable ones. :)<br />
<br />
As always, those of you whose sole contribution is to post very inane or derogatory things will be banned.<br />

One Man Army<br />
Yes. Many of the problems we've had with Ret are of the &quot;one man army&quot; category, where a paladin can do a lot of damage, then go defensive and heal themselves up. We love the kit of the paladin who can heal as well as do damage, but it needs to be tightly controlled. Word of Glory gives us that control. We have the room to make the spell really powerful because we know its on a tight cooldown and you sacrifice dps to use it. We can't do that today with say Flash of Light, because once you can cast one strong FoL, you can cast a bunch of them until you go OOM (at which point you Judge or Divine Plea, and you're going again). Similarly, we can make Selfless Healer nearly overpowered because you can't use it on yourself and because even with it you're not going to out compete a Holy paladin in healing. If you can occasionally contribute to group healing in tight spots, then that's great. That's some utility you can provide. (Note: Don't oversell this as &quot;I'll get brought to raids because of my healing.&quot;) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560848132/ret-primary-problems-with-build-12803/))<br />
<br />
Class balance and RNG<br />
That's the wrong view to take though. The equivalent would be &quot;I'm balanced around getting a crit every swing, so when that doesn't happen, RNG screws me.&quot; You get a Templar's Verdict every 3 Crusader Strikes. Sometimes you get lucky and need fewer. You of course need to pay attention for when that happens and be able to react to it and alter your immediate plans. That right there is the element we think is most missing from today's Ret paladin. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560848132/ret-primary-problems-with-build-12803/))<br />
<br />
Words of Glory<br />
The amount it heals is most definitely balanced around how good it will be for Holy. <br />
Those numbers don't have to be the same though. The new talent tree design affords us a lot more flexibility in that regard. Part of the reason Word of Glory is so useful to Holy is because it costs no mana. Ret doesn't really care about mana, because it comes and goes easily, but a Ret generally won't be able to sit there and queue up several Holy Lights in a row. They will be able to sometimes use a Word of Glory though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560848132/ret-primary-problems-with-build-12803/))<br />

<br />
in other words typical blizzard, disagree with us in any way and youll be banned, as a hunter who uses volley a lot for aoe situations I think i have a right to moan about this, all i can say is whatever they put in the game to replace it better be as useful/damaging or or your gonna get a lot of pissed off hunters in the game.<br />
<br />
multishot that hits 1 or 2 mobs is nothing like volley so to compare the 2 is crazy, thats like saying a rogues blade flurry is a valid aoe ability in a group of 5 or 6 mobs......ignoring the fact it only hits some of them.<br />
<br />
the bigger question is why? why can you not have volley and multishot working side by side the same as you have for years why change something that noone im aware of qqs about(i dont recall any volley sucks qqs) it just seems blizz are changing things for the sake of it now stop trying to over complicate things like this blizzard because in doing so your proably going to end of removing abilitys like this that a lot of people use for some unknown reason i cant think of other then u fancied stirring the class yet again.<br />

You don't understand that ALL AoE was nerfed massively! AoE will always be behind and only worth it for really large groups where kill order doesn't matter.<br />

if it changes will remain to be seen, it wouldnt be the first time blizzard have overstated something to justify one of there changes, as far as the expansion goes i thought expansions were meant to be about adding to the game? so why remove a popular spell used by a lot of hunters when they need fast aoe? it just seems to have no reason to me other then blizzard meddling with the class for the sake of it its not like its a bugged spell or a lot of people want it nerfed etc ive certainly never seen ne volley qqs so why change what works?</div></div><hr />

He's wearing tusks of a pit lord. I believe Mannoroth's skull is above his throne in Orgrimmar so I doubt they are mannoroth's, though it would be somewhat fitting if they were.</div></div><hr />

For the engine limitations this looks neato as ass. Yet I find it too bad that the same care that went into this place doesn't show through the entire continent. <br />
<br />
In my opinion some parts are just really half assed done. They know they can do better and they just don't... This as a player just really puts me off. This should be the expansion that revisits everything and yet.. its not really happening, they aren't pulling the strings hard enough. <br />
<br />
The iconic and strong designs for architecture and so on has been their strong point. Personally I don't see why they as artists strife to give the whole world this same attention and try their best to make it look as aking to the epic concept art as possible. On the limited time argument I say meh. They've 11 million audience I'm sure a few more artists can be payed with that.</div></div><hr />

Most of the time when people hit old instances for giggles or achivements people just go there making sure they got a tank or 2 and a few healers whatever else can be alts or whatnot. At least that's my experience. Starting to fret cause you're losing Volley is realy &quot;SKY IS FALLING&quot; of you :)<br />
<br />
Don't forget that post from GC said that they would also change Multishot around a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless you're in beta, you have no right to complain as you are basing your arguments on your own imagination of how Catacylsm will play out.<br />
<br />
As it stands right now, mobs in Cataclysm hit HARD (as long as you're at the level your supposed to be fighting them, instead of overgearing). Whilst leveling, unless you sacrific a lot of your DPS for survivablity talents/abilties... you will be having a lot of downtime in between mobs.<br />
<br />
On my Death Knight whilst leveling in Hyjal, i had to pretty much use Death Strike EVERY TIME it was available otherwise i was dangerously close to dieing... and that was in TANK spec with only 2 non-elites attacking me.<br />
<br />
In raids, the only time i can see that you will be AoEing is on large packs of non-elites... and they won't be a threat anyway.</div></div><hr />

(which has been said by a blizzard blue), feels like blizzard didn't know what the hell they were doing with the class at all with that spell. &quot;hunters need an AE and threw it together in a day&quot;. disapointing. No explanation as to why, with the amount of why it shouldn't be there, it's there to begin with. No one ever mentions that... <br />
<br />
As for Ret paladins being a one man army, surely that's the same for DK's, hunters, warlocks ... i mean their pets aren't a &quot;man&quot; or &quot;person&quot;.. so technically they are one man armies too. Sometimes i wonder if blizzard blues think before they open their mouths then i remember the majority are american.. and just nod and go &quot;yeah one man armies..&quot; and &quot;colour&quot; hasn't got a u in it... neither has harbour or armour.. and yet american say they use &quot;english&quot;, no they use &quot;american&quot;, not our fault noel webster couldn't spell or pronounce his words.<br />
<br />
-munches popcorn- wonder what their next change to Ret Paladins will be, there will be more changes to them - blizzard have never got the class even close to right. I'd stop playing it, but have you ever levelled a warrior before.. it's hell and certainly not worth the bills or the inability to solo dungeons. (even a certain level 58-60 one where you need at least one magical ability to destroy a certain mob, although holy water from another dungeon does work, it is a pain).<br />
<br />
i don't even understand why worgen and goblin become DK's surely they join alliance and horde AFTER the lich king is dead... bolvar has taken over and we're all back from northrend. Very odd.<br />
<br />
Sky wall looks good, but then i saw that from total biscuits uldum video, mixing stargat.. i mean changing egyptician themes.. not copied at all from everywhere else (like blizzard would do such a thing) and arabian nights them with the air and djinns (whose tatoos and colour look very similar to a certain supernatural episode mixed with genie from disneys aladdin)</div></div><hr />

multishot that hits 1 or 2 mobs is nothing like volley so to compare the 2 is crazy, thats like saying a rogues blade flurry is a valid aoe ability in a group of 5 or 6 mobs......ignoring the fact it only hits some of them.<br />
<br />
the bigger question is why? why can you not have volley and multishot working side by side the same as you have for years why change something that noone im aware of qqs about(i dont recall any volley sucks qqs) it just seems blizz are changing things for the sake of it now stop trying to over complicate things like this blizzard because in doing so your proably going to end of removing abilitys like this that a lot of people use for some unknown reason i cant think of other then u fancied stirring the class yet again.<br />
<br />
`<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure Blizzard made it clear that it had to be &quot;...inane or derogatory&quot; in order to get the said ban. Constructive criticism is what Blizzard wants from players, not a bunch of whiny brats ruining the forums saying they can predict the future of a class through the change of one spell.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't express that Blizzard is changing things for the sake of changing them, but if you read into what WoW has been for the last 2 years after Heroic badge farming was introduced, you might have a little more insight as to why they may try to quell AOE. This comes from (currently) any group running an instance or (old) raid decides that the Tank -must- hold an entire pulls worth of Mobs instantly and tightly so that the DPS can spam their AOE and get the trash down quick. I believe this is Blizzard's intention and we just haven't seen the whole of it yet. We will not see AOE removed, that would be counter-productive. However, if they limit the amount of classes that can dish out the AOE damage, then it no longer becomes a viable strategy and we return to the days of caring about what target we are hitting, and what our threat building is looking like.<br />
<br />
PS: Like everyone's posts, most is speculative and for all intents and purposes you could be 100% right, and I could be the opposite. Just my two cents from a different prospective.<br />

That's not what they said at all. People can disagree. But there is a huge difference between honest concern and asking questions as opposed to blatant QQ. If you read what said on the forums, there won't be AoE like there was in LK. Are you mad that you can just hit one button and AoE all the trash? Are you mad that you might have to focus fire on the tanks target? They are buffing MS and ET to make them better when an AoE situation occurs. What exactly are you mad about? Now, what if Blizz said, okay no more multi-shot, you just get volley. Would you moan then? Why? You got to keep your huge AoE spell. Or is this general &quot;You nerfed my class QQ&quot;? If Blizz just took away Volley and didn't buff multi-shot and explosive trap then I would fully agree, but they aren't. You really have to read, not just look at the words. You'd understand.</div></div><hr />

2. GC did NOT say that they will ban you if you disagree. He said they will ban you if you troll.<br />
<br />
In Blizzard's view, disagreeing is trolling. GC only agrees with people who match up with his predetermined notions, the beta forums are a sham - the internal build is always 5 or 6 builds ahead and it's convenient that the only time they acknowledge the fans is when they've already come up with it themselves. Whenever a legitimate concern is raised that they didn't think of first, Blizzard ignores it because &quot;players can't think like designers&quot;. <br />
<br />
Back in Wrath beta when Ret pally damage was insanely out of whack, Blizzard said &quot;we don't balance lvl 80 talents around lvl 70.&quot; When Pally's came out the first week of the Wrath patch doing 9000 DPS when everyone else was at 2000, then they said &quot;Oh&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, with as many issues as they had with the easy of paladins being able to solo heroic 5s while in T9/10 you would think they would learn and make that harder not easier.

It wasn't until WoTLK that Paladins were considered seriously in groups, and even after wotlk, we were OP for a patch or so, then we were nerfed in a variety of places. <br />
I still see bad paladins die to stuff in PvE all the time, and people QQ'ing about paladins are usually those who don't know how to counter ANY other classes in pvp with their own, let alone a paladin. (srsly, if you see a bubble.. move away)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding AoE: Yes, AoE will not be desirable unless you greatly outgear the content - that is what Blizz has stated. Imagine it like trash packs in Ulduar or Royal Quarters (Blood wing) of ICC - they pretty much required some form of CC.<br />
<br />
Regarding Multi-shot: Blizz said it WILL be changed from current Wrath implementation (however they didnt say how) so please stop whining. Right now in Cataclysm it does less overall damage than a single target shot (Aimed, Chimera, Explosive) but bigger problem is that you have absolutely NO control which targets are going to be hit with the two extra arrows so it is very easy to break CC with it (if the CCed target was CCed after entering combat). After all, Multishot is not even AoE spell, it is just ranged form of Cleave that can affect mobs in 180° &quot;cone&quot; unlike AoE spells that dont even require to face the area/mob you want to hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ever go into BC heroic and try to solo it on an ICC geared 80? Damn hard considering they are a whopping 10 levels below you!!<br />
<br />
With the universal freezing trap that affects most mobs regardless of type and their excellent kiting capability any hunter who is ctually skilled will find themselves very desirable in the homecoming of crowd control. Back in classic WoW a hunter could lock down 2 or even 3 mobs simultaneously, and this was BEFORE traps were usable in combat<br />
<br />
So relax guys, you'll be too busy juggling several mobs around to volley anyway</div></div><hr />

I think that would work nicely.<br />
They already said that one of the things they didn't like about Volley was that it was a channeled ability. You can bet that whatever changes they make to Multi-shot it won't be that it is channeled.<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm they are trying to nerf AoE damage. With the addition of trap launcher it would be very easy for a hunter to fire an explosive trap and then volley to get some decent numbers probably higher than other classes. In order to balance that you either need to have some kind of exclusive cooldown between the two (that would feel very clunky), nerf the damage of both explosive trap and volley (in which case both feel pretty week), or you remove one of the abilities. If you go with their idea of removing an ability that just doesn't feel very &quot;huntery&quot; I think Volley fits that bill. <br />
<br />
I think Explosive Trap and Multishot should provide adequate AoE where necessary, especially once they've tweaked Multishot a bit.</div></div><hr />

in other words typical blizzard, disagree with us in any way and youll be banned, as a hunter who uses volley a lot for aoe situations I think i have a right to moan about this, all i can say is whatever they put in the game to replace it better be as useful/damaging or or your gonna get a lot of pissed off hunters in the game.<br />
<br />
multishot that hits 1 or 2 mobs is nothing like volley so to compare the 2 is crazy, thats like saying a rogues blade flurry is a valid aoe ability in a group of 5 or 6 mobs......ignoring the fact it only hits some of them.<br />
<br />
So not only can you not discern between disagreeing with a gameplay decision and worthless posts, you didn't even read that Multi-shot would be altered to fill the AOE gap removing Volley would create. Good job champ.</div></div><hr />

A few quests in Hyjal and damn near all of Deepholm REQUIRE a flying mount to complete. And with the linear quest progression, if you can't complete a quest, you usually get stuck very quickly.<br />

I suppose someone could just grind mobs to 85 at that point, but by that time they would have easily made enough gold to buy the flying mount.</div></div><hr />

GC only agrees with people who match up with his predetermined notions, the beta forums are a sham - the internal build is always 5 or 6 builds ahead and it's convenient that the only time they acknowledge the fans is when they've already come up with it themselves. Whenever a legitimate concern is raised that they didn't think of first, Blizzard ignores it because &quot;players can't think like designers&quot;. <br />
<br />
Back in Wrath beta when Ret pally damage was insanely out of whack, Blizzard said &quot;we don't balance lvl 80 talents around lvl 70.&quot; When Pally's came out the first week of the Wrath patch doing 9000 DPS when everyone else was at 2000, then they said &quot;Oh&quot;.<br />
<br />
Point #1: If you have that much hate for Blizzard, why are you playing their game?<br />
<br />
Point #2: It is not that GC only agrees with people who line up with his design views. It's that his job is not to design the game based around what players say they want. If you give feedback in line with the stated design goals for Cataclysm, which in this case is &quot;Reduced reliance on AoE and lower AoE damage overall&quot;, then you are fine. <br />
<br />
Point #3: You do realize that the point of beta is NOT for the players to help design the game. Blizzard pays a team of people a decent amount of money to do that. We are there to say &quot;This thing isn't working the way you said it was supposed to&quot;. Not &quot;That design sucks, implement these completely different things instead.&quot; Which is why anyone crying that Blizzard has destroyed hunters for the rest of time is pointless right now because we haven't been given the completed design for hunter AoE to test. Constructive feedback would be to wait for the Multi-shot changes to be implemented, testing it, and if you don't feel that the implemented design makes up for the loss of volley, suggest ways to improve the implemented design. And do this without crying to have volley back, asking them to completely overhaul stuff, or insulting/flaming Blizzard or their design team.<br />
<br />
Be happy that Blizzard is even bothering to share all of this. They could do like every other company and have an NDA in place on their closed beta up until release.</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, not a big fan of this raid for 2 reasons: only 2 bosses ; we will need to fly around (Occulus) As lock I already see myself having to TP raid mates who got lost or afked right after we cleaned a platform. <br />
The place itself if really nice looking though :)<br />
<br />
Should that really be your concern? Your raid leader should enforce a -no afk during raids- rule unless its totally nesseccery,not getting lost should be easily fixed by simply not beeing a dumbass and paying attention to the rest of the group. Should it happen anyway,well you're a lock,do you remember how things were in vanilla? exactly.<br />
<br />
Back to the original subject,the place looks awesome,love the soft pastel coloring and the smooth feel it gives. I can hardly wait to try the raid! One thing about platforms that could be slightly annoying is probably the minimal fighting space and the fact you can fall off during the raid if you're not paying attention or maybe blizz gets really mean and gives the boss a knockback skill :p</div></div><hr />

You people fail to realise that the skull of Mannoroth is as big as an orc, and the tusks even bigger (you can check this in Orgrimmar). Also, from ALL the images, Warcraft 3 cinematic, etc. we can see that Mannoroth has SMOOTH tusks, no spines on them whatsoever.

People are waaaay to spoiled by the plethora of information, go to the star wars mmo forums and try to find out about 1 of the abilities in the game. The lack of any concrete information about anything in the game that actually matters, like the talent trees for example is sad, Bioware is telling NOTHING except pre planned overproduced video snippets that tell them NOTHING.

People QQ'ing about loss of Volley seem to be skipping-over the rest of what was said:<br />

We think Multi-Shot is a more interesting ability and can fill the hunter AE niche (along with Explosive Trap). We'll have to change Multi-Shot from the current version to get it there. <br />

the bigger question is why? why can you not have volley and multishot working side by side the same as you have for years why change something that noone im aware of qqs about(i dont recall any volley sucks qqs) it just seems blizz are changing things for the sake of it now stop trying to over complicate things like this blizzard because in doing so your proably going to end of removing abilitys like this that a lot of people use for some unknown reason i cant think of other then u fancied stirring the class yet again.<br />

I dont see Volley being removed to be a big deal. Hunters use Focus anyway, so using a channeled spell seems hard to balance. If it was 50 focus, it wouldn't be able to be spammed anyway, you would need a steady shot inbetween casts.</div></div><hr />

It was the fact that I learned my class for the last 2 years, had a massive range of spells and worked on a tight rotation. But in Occulus, that meant nothing, just spam one button the whole time when clearing trash. The frustration hits when nobody knows what the hell to do on the last boss.

I was expecting... I don't know... more? Or maybe I'm just reading it all wrong.<br />

I don't think they understand a damn thing about Paladins -_- we are strong in PVE cause we can last, but in PVP? WE SUCK!!!!! Morons....<br />
You do? Really?<br />
<br />
You know, that's funny, because the last time I PvP'd up against paladins, they damn near kicked my ass. I was fighting a retadin... it seemed we had her outgunned, but she started healing herself over and over and over until her reinforcements arrived (another paladin and a rogue) and they wiped us out.<br />
<br />
On numerous occasions I have tried (and usually failed) to kill paladin healers in PvP. They just won't die. And paladin tanks? They're one of the best tank classes that can PvP! They can dish out more damage (in my experience) than warrior tanks, they can take nearly as much damage as bear tanks, and they can heal themselves when they are on the brink of death.<br />
<br />
Paladins last in PvE AND PvP.</div></div><hr />

Na, Blizzard has stated that no raid dungeon in Cataclysm will have more than 6 boss encounters but because of that we will get more raids per tier. In the end we'll hopefully have the same number of bosses. Skywall seems like the Cata version of Gruul's Lair.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WOAH. That seems a little more extreme to me. As posters have said before me, the wording makes it seem like there are two encounters, one of which is Iron Council-style.<br />
<br />
I don't mind keeping some of the raids small, but I hope that the total number of raid encounters available at release will be comparable to or greater than Wrath's. From what we've heard so far, it sounds like there will be three raids upon release- Skywall, Bastion of Twilight and Blackwing Descent. It looks like they'll have 2, 4 and 6 bosses respectively, adding up to 12. Add an algalon-style fight to each raid and you have 15. How does that compare to the other expansions?</div></div><hr />

It's already better than wotlk which only had 2 bosses on release.</div></div><hr />

Yes, if hunters lost volley and multi-shot remained the same as it is now, that would suck. That's not going to happen. I expect it to either drastically increase in the number of targets it can hit or become a targeted fan of knives. Volley just doesn't work with energy/fous.<br />

<br />
I was going to go more in-depth on this but... protection pallies aren't a threat, ret paladins are so kitable it's not even funny, and holy paladins are a pain, just like every other healer in the game.<br />
<br />
Pro tip: Every ability they have (even bubble!) is of the holy school. Use your counterspells and silences, please.<br />

Oh yeah, it blasts wrath out of the water, with its refurbished content. But didn't BC (I didn't raid during it, so forgive me if I'm wrong) have a ton more? Like 20+ if you count the 10-man Karazhan?</div></div><hr />

Now if only pallys had some sort of instant heal on a 6 sec timer....O WAIT....stop being bad.<br />

Again i ask did you clear naxx at 60....betting not so it was new content for you.</div></div><hr />

First of all, let's keep this friendly. The focus of my post wasn't complaining about naxx. I'm trying to figure out how much I should be impressed by Cataclysm's entry level raid content compared to previous expansions. Cataclysm will have less bosses than wrath did at release, but they're all completely new fights.<br />
<br />
Second of all, I already said that all healers were a pain to kill. Holy paladins are no exception. And last time I checked, neither ret nor prot paladins had access to the 6 second cooldown holy shock. They might even get an instant flash of light every once in a while!<br />
<br />
Personally, I eat paladins alive on my warrior and (especially) my mage... so... are you asking me to stop being good?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legendairee</div><div class="date">2010-08-26, 04:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">there are 3 entry level raids, with a total of over 10 iirc bosses</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you might ask, why is my post inane (and therefore irrelevant since it will be ignored by the devs)? <br />
<br />
Good question: it's because every point you raised was already addressed and explained. You've offered nothing in the form of a logical rationale to go in a different direction.<br />
<br />
1) Multishot gets changed to become something in between what it is now and what volley is now rather than keeping them both... what it is now does not stay the same while volley gets removed. You're really just moaning about keeping the ability name &quot;multishot&quot; for an ability you've never seen or used that is a hybrid of the two. You go girl!<br />
<br />
2) The new hybrid AE aligns with other AE changes occurring in other classes for Cata; ie tuned for the role they expect hunters to play relative to other classes. God forbid they design a game where each class has a separate style of play and role that fits in with the rest of the game. <br />
<br />
3) According to their numbers, multishot got largely ignored in favor of volley, so both versions of AE existing in parallel previously is also meaningless.<br />
<br />
Introduce a new idea and maybe folks would care.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
`As always, those of you whose sole contribution is to post very inane or derogatory things will be banned.`<br />
<br />
<br />
in other words typical blizzard, disagree with us in any way and youll be banned, as a hunter who uses volley a lot for aoe situations I think i have a right to moan about this, all i can say is whatever they put in the game to replace it better be as useful/damaging or or your gonna get a lot of pissed off hunters in the game.<br />
<br />
multishot that hits 1 or 2 mobs is nothing like volley so to compare the 2 is crazy, thats like saying a rogues blade flurry is a valid aoe ability in a group of 5 or 6 mobs......ignoring the fact it only hits some of them.<br />
<br />
the bigger question is why? why can you not have volley and multishot working side by side the same as you have for years why change something that noone im aware of qqs about(i dont recall any volley sucks qqs) it just seems blizz are changing things for the sake of it now stop trying to over complicate things like this blizzard because in doing so your proably going to end of removing abilitys like this that a lot of people use for some unknown reason i cant think of other then u fancied stirring the class yet again.<br />

I think 18 is not 2... Naxx had 15, and then one in Obsidian Sanctum, Eye of Eternity and Vault of Archavon. I think you wanted to point out that Naxx wasnt new and you dont count Archavon to be a raid boss. But in fact, Archavon required a raid group and dropped raiding loot. And also Naxxramas´s loot improved &quot;a bit&quot; from level 60 so it was relevant raiding content. 18 bosses are 18 bosses, not 2</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mechanics of naxxramas was watered down so much. nevermind naxx, heroics was basically normal, no challenge at all. the fact that a piss easy boss like lokan caused so much whine is demonstration that wotlk whines are worthless. the fact that wotlk did not give the same amount of subscription rise as tbc is another proof that wotlk raid design is a failure.<br />
<br />
2 bosses are 2 bosses, not 18. what you say is irrelevent. If you want to support activision so badly, feel welcome to buy their shares instead of coming here posting crap information.<br />
<br />
Atm, cataclysm has over 5 times more raiding content on release than wotlk, so stuff that.</div></div><hr />
