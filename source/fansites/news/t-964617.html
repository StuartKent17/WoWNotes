Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Step right up and prepare to be amazed!<br />
<br />
It’s incredible! It’s unbelievable! You’ll be dazzled. You’ll be amazed! You aren’t prepared for the Darkmoon Faire, ‘cause it’s like nothing you’ve seen before! Don’t be shy now, don’t be bashful, step right up for a tantalizing glimpse of what we’ve got in store for you when patch 4.3 arrives!<br />
<br />
That old thing?<br />
<br />
No, no, no, Clem. The Darkmoon Faire isn’t what it used to be and it isn’t where it used to be. The management hasn’t changed but the Faire certainly has. It’s a whole new animal. Tickets? You don’t need those old tickets, just rip ‘em right up, ‘cause we’ve got new tickets! Out with the old, in with the new -- new quests, that is! Things have changed ‘round here: we’ve got an island all to ourselves now, and what an island it is. Mist-shrouded Darkmoon Island is a conundrum wrapped in an enigma. It’s a place of mystery and wonder, and you wouldn’t believe the deals we made to get it… or who we made ‘em with. But never mind that, just follow me right through here and I’ll show you what the Darkmoon Faire is all about.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
All new! All spectacular!<br />
<br />
Catch a show at the marvelous main stage or witness a dazzling fireworks display. But don’t stare too long or you might miss the stunning spectacles that surround you. Gaze in awe of our magical menagerie, get your fortune told by the amazing Sayge, go on a pony ride, experience the healthful effects of carnival food, and more!<br />
<br />
Of course, there’s more to the Darkmoon Faire than just fantastic shows and culinary delights. You can still turn in your Darkmoon Cards, but you wouldn’t just come here for measly ol’ cards when there’s so much more to see, experience, and win. Yes, win! You like dancing bears, right? Everybody likes dancing bears. Even bears like dancing bears. How about a dancing bear… you can ride!<br />
<br />
That’s not all! We have adorable companion pets includin’ a fez-wearing monkey, a plethora of profession recipes, toys, balloons, souvenirs, delectable carnival snacks and beverages, heirlooms for the little ones, and even replicas of long-lost suits of armor that we’re offering for your Transmogrification needs. You can also make your mark with new achievements and titles. All it takes to earn these fabulous rewards is a few Darkmoon Faire Prize Tickets and a good reputation with the carnies. How do ya get your grubby mitts on some tickets? I’m glad you asked!<br />
<br />
Step right up! Try your luck! Everyone’s a winner!<br />
<br />
Have we got games? You bet we’ve got games, and they’re so easy to play an orc could do it. Just head on over to the midway, buy some Darkmoon Game Tokens, and get ready to play. Easy to learn, difficult to master, anyone can play and everyone can win. Just lay your tokens down for a chance at winning Darkmoon Prize Tickets playing games like Whack-a-Gnoll, the Tonk Battle Royale, the Cannon, Ring Toss, the Shooting Gallery, and more! Five games are there to test your skills at any one time. The better you play, the easier it is to win a bucket of Darkmoon Faire Prize Tickets! Once a month, you’ve got a shot at tickets, and the fun never stops ‘cause you can play as many times as you like. But that’s not the only way to win big!<br />
<br />

<br />
The Darkmoon Faire Field Guide<br />
<br />
It’s your passport to riches, my friend. Y’see, we need a few things -- just some junk, nothing valuable to a big hero like you. We call ‘em Darkmoon Artifacts, and there’s all different kinds to be found all over Azeroth. The Darkmoon Field Guide helps you discover artifacts while you’re explorin’ dungeons, slayin’ monsters, and fightin’ in Battlegrounds. Without a guide, you’d never notice ‘em, and it’ll help keep you focused on the stuff we want. Whether you just reached level 10, or you’ve crushed the biggest baddies in the land, we need somethin’ from nearly everybody. You won’t have to go too far out of your way to get ‘em and each month you’ll get a new opportunity to seek out an Artifact for us. What do you get out of the deal? Don’t you worry, you’ll get your cut. When you bring a Darkmoon Artifact back to us, you’ll get valuable experience (it builds character, you know!), earn a better reputation, and possibly earn precious Darkmoon Faire Prize Tickets too!<br />
<br />
Oh, did I mention that you can use the Field Guide to get to Darkmoon Island whenever the Darkmoon Faire’s monthly extravaganza is up and running?<br />
<br />
So, you want to work in show business?<br />
<br />
Maybe you’d like a little peek behind the scenes, eh? Want to see what it takes to run the greatest show on Azeroth? Well, it’s not all sunshine and cotton candy, my friend. There are beasts to heal, food to cook, and buildings to fix. If you’re willing help keep the show going and put your skills to work, you’ll not only impress us, but you can get experience, Darkmoon Prize Tickets, and even polish up your skills -- up to five skill points per profession, per Faire week, if you’re good at what you do!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Darkmoon Deathmatch!<br />
<br />
Like any good carnival, the Darkmoon Faire has a shady side. You can leave the skilled labor to the suckers and go for a faster score instead. If you’ve got the minerals, the Darkmoon Deathmatch offers an experience unparalleled since the Gurubashi Arena. Pitmaster Pei has a big old treasure chest just brimming with goodies and Darkmoon Faire Prize Tickets that he’ll drag out into the Darkmoon Deathmatch Pit every three hours or so. Everybody wants it, so if you want a piece of the action you’ll just have to jump in and prove that you’re the toughest one in the Pit.<br />
<br />
Oh, the Faire is perfectly safe, Clem. Just don’t wander into the woods.<br />
<br />
Now, now, don’t panic. Darkmoon Isle might be a bit spooky, but except for the Deathmatch Pit, the Faire itself is completely safe, I guarantee it. It’s a sanctuary even, and we won’t let anybody’s beef ruin the fun. The shadowy woods surroundin’ the fair are another thing entirely, though. I wouldn’t say that people have disappeared into those woods never to return, but, well… people disappear into those woods never to return. So watch your step , and your back, when you leave the Faire. Don’t say I didn’t warn ya!<br />
<br />

<br />
Mark your calendar<br />
<br />
Now that you know how amazing the new Darkmoon Faire is, you won’t want to miss it. Just take a look at your in-game calendar, and the Darkmoon Faire dates will show up there on the first week of every month. Darkmoon Faire barkers and displays will also pop up in every capital city to herald the arrival of the Faire. Silas Darkmoon himself has even started up a mailer to make sure that no one misses out!<br />
<br />
Hitch a ride<br />
<br />
During the first week of each month, convenient Darkmoon Faire outposts with Darkmoon Portals will appear in Elwynn Forest and Mulgore, offering free rides to Darkmoon Island and the Faire!<br />
<br />
Darkmoon Mages in capital cities and on Darkmoon Island will also be around to help you get between the Faire and various capital cities. There’s no such thing as a free lunch, so naturally you’re obliged to compensate them for their services.<br />
<br />
The all new Darkmoon Faire is coming to Darkmoon Island in patch 4.3. Don’t miss it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get the feeling that new rep rewards with DMF will be low to nonexistent. That way they can keep DMF in the Insane rep grind since it'd still be, y'know, insane. Granted, only having one shot at each activity per month would still keep your grind slow, so it's possible they could put in a nice chunk to help you along (just throwing a number out, but getting, say, 2k rep per month would still take almost 2 years, so you'd still have to supplement your grind with Darkmoon decks if you wanted to finish sooner).<br />
<br />
I was worried about the description (especially since they said you only got access to it once a month, and my initial reading made me think it was a new daily hub), but a bit more comprehension alleviated my concerns. Fun activities to do? New recipes, pets, and mounts? Ability to get unobtainable gear again? Color me excited.<br />
<br />
Also note the mages that will port you to and from capitals and DMF. It'll cost gold (most likely), but DMF becomes a portal hub for one week a month? Interesting.<br />
<br />
(On a side note, I like how a couple people are complaining you only get access to the place one week a month. You are aware that that's been DMF's schedule since its inception, no?)</div></div><hr />

What IS it? Did you NOT read the article?<br />
<br />
It helps up my proffession skills, discontinued armor is being made available, alts gain experience for doing it, there's an ARENA DEATHMATCH thing like in STV that gives rewards (rewards probably for level 85s!

ARENA DEATMATCH! D: Why does no one like this????<br />
<br />
Lemme just remind u that casuals completely outnumber non-casuals and they are very thankful for the few things they get. Hardcore people are always hungry for more content and NEVER satisfied when they get it. Honestly the casuals deserve these things. They didn't get anything for like 3 patches! The zandalari instances were too hard for most of them, dailies are kind of a mixed bag as only few people, casual or not, enjoy them.</div></div><hr />

Pulling numbers out of your ass to try and prove a point makes me laugh.<br />
<br />
This as I said will make those that plays for other reasons then me, you and mr.hardcore raider happy and give them something more to do, I give Blizzard props for actually adding content for others then just the whiny, sel centered raiders who thinks everything should revolve around them.<br />
<br />
And as for content, we will get content for 4.3, so I'm not to worried.<br />
<br />
I just dont see why it's so wrong that they add something for the RP players(they will love this) and the extremely casuals once in a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1% care about it now (though that 1% is your opinion I see no sources for that percentage) They are remaking it so that more than *1%* will care about it, a monthly hub, with stuff to do, things to collect, content for those that don't focus all their time to raiding, there are many different types of people that play this game, you only want them to give content to those that raid or PvP? (I'm guessing) <br />
<br />
Never knockback the fun stuffs, it's what makes the game enjoyable for a huge percentage of players, I love DMF, (heck I play on the realm DMF) and am buzzing that it is getting a make over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like any good carnival, the Darkmoon Faire has a shady side. You can leave the skilled labor to the suckers and go for a faster score instead. If you’ve got the minerals, the Darkmoon Deathmatch offers an experience unparalleled since the Gurubashi Arena. Pitmaster Pei has a big old treasure chest just brimming with goodies and Darkmoon Faire Prize Tickets that he’ll drag out into the Darkmoon Deathmatch Pit every three hours or so. Everybody wants it, so if you want a piece of the action you’ll just have to jump in and prove that you’re the toughest one in the Pit.<br />
<br />
Ah going to enjoy this so much, This makes it more exciting. This was actually needed for a long time seeing how the Faire has been pretty much outdated for awhile now</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if they keep it the same rep, we have no clue how much rep will be obtainable, I mean it looks like a monthly thing, so you will only beable to gain rep once per month, so it doesn't sound like it's going to be such a cake walk, and to be fair getting DMF isn't hard, it's just costly and time consuming, I would welcome this. <br />
<br />
And if it is a new rep , then that's fine too:)</div></div><hr />

we’ve got an island all to ourselves now, and what an island it is. Mist-shrouded Darkmoon Island is a conundrum wrapped in an enigma. It’s a place of mystery and wonder! this for me sells it that the next xpac is going to be &quot;mists of pandaria&quot; :cool:</div></div><hr />

It was a loooooooooooooooooong time since we had anything &quot;new&quot; and fun to do aside from raiding, which in my honest opinion has been really, really boring in Cataclysm (Not because of the raids, but due to the fact that I've been doing it for 6 years). I've wanted an updated Gurubashi Arena thing for ages, I remember back in Vanilla when over 60 people would camp for the chest and killing each other. The fact that you'll be able to get old stuff back is also neat, I just hope none of this will end up being a disappointment.<br />
<br />
Edit: To all the people saying they should use resources/manpower to develop PvE and PvP things instead... You don't seriously believe that Blizzard only has one giant group of people doing everything? It's quite obvious that they have different teams for different things. It -is- possible for a company as large as Blizzard to do several things at the same time, y'know.<br />
... Now look at what you've done, you made me defend Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

The only really fun thing I can see out of this is the deathmatch, and unless they ban groups in the pit, it's just going to turn into a clusterf**k, wherein the same few groups of PvP savants farm it, and the rest are left to die. This honestly sounds like a flashy Argent Tournament, but one for which you get to wait three weeks to get back to grinding for tickets. I'd much rather see them dedicate the man power from this to go for something new and original. Just my thoughts. I know they won't be popular.</div></div><hr />

No I did not miss it. I said it looks like GILNEAN woods. Not Gilneas. I mean it seems to be around Gilneas. It might be off the coast. It has the same trees as Tol Barad which is just off the coast too.<br />

And why would they try and resurrect something that 1% of the playerbase cares about. I visit the DMF once per expansion, for my trinket, and that's it.

<br />
Fine, it's fluff. Fluff was what made the game interesting, what put the &quot;World&quot; in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
My only concern is that DMF will expire at the end of the expansion. I really hope it's designed in a way to keep it relevant throughout the rest of WoW, like the cards.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad to see the darkmoon faire get an overhaul though, because it was always pretty lame to be honest. Another event like the chest in STV is good, perhaps finally higher lvl players will care less about the one in STV. Giving the lowbies an acctual chance to get it. Tank battle game?! sign me up! <br />
Anyone curious about what's in the woods? Perhaps huge horrifying monsters? Or rare spawns? Sons of arugal, the old model for worgen. That would be creepy enough! :P</div></div><hr />

well t7 arnt complete look alikes i for one hate the look of the war t7/7.5 but love the t3 look.<br />

also the za gear is slightly different too and a lot of the original zg gear is no longer obtainable.<br />

ALSO season 1/2 weapons and season 3 gear is no longer obtainable.<br />

there are as well many quest items that have unique modles that cant be obtained any longer....but if they do bring some of these back i dont see them bringing back all of them (ei. corrupted ashbringer)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because people are looking for actual content, not a daily quest hub with arbitrary gating mechanics to pace how long it takes you to actually get to the end so that it will last until the next expansion since 4.3 is the last content patch until the next expansion.<br />
<br />
If you looked at it expansion by expansion, this is the worst expansion by amount of actual content but each time someone brings it up, some Blizzard apologist quickly comes up with some excuse demanding people to stop being so negative. Why? Did your monthly subscription start costing less? Did Cataclysm expansion cost less than the TBC expansion or WotLK expansion?<br />
<br />
TBC gave us nearly 60 raid bosses, a new &quot;planet&quot;, a ton of new dungeons and bosses within, heroics, and love it or hate it gave us arenas and daily BG/honor grinds as a way for PvPers to compete which was also brand new content. WotLK gave us like 45 some raid bosses, a new continent, a handful of new dungeons, and it gave casuals a way to gear up with the Argent Tournament.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm will end up giving us 20? some raid bosses and at least 2 end ones so far have been recycled (Nef and Ragnaros), 7 new dungeons and recycled for us Shadowfang Keep and Deadmines, recycled ZA and ZG and called them &quot;new&quot;, gave us like 5 new zones. The content is so lacking, in fact, that Blizzard apologists are so desperate that you're willing to latch on to a side event like the Darkmoon Faire and call it &quot;content&quot;? Oh look it adds a mount ooooh. And some companion pets. Oooooh. So a billion dollar company took a year to add 1 mount and some companion pets? This is what you accept as content now when you are paying the same price? Your bar is so low?<br />
<br />
They're not even bothering trying to put out new content because they decided that after 5 years of saying they didn't want you changing how you looked, they reneged and introduced transmogrification and you said HOORAY. So the &quot;new content&quot; of Cataclysm is you going back to do level 60 raids to get the gear you sold 4 years ago, that way, they don't have to make any new things for you because you're too busy going HEHEHE LETS GET THE OLD STUFF AGAIN THAT I FARMED BEFORE.<br />
<br />
This is why the game is dumbed down. Because Blizzard keeps lowering the bar and instead of getting an outcry, you just nod and lower your expectations below their bar and accept what they gave you. Giving you less and less each year but trying to squeeze out more microtransactions, and you keep paying for extra while accepting less for the same price you've been paying.<br />
<br />
It's absurd. And stupid.<br />

Content? It's not content. It's laughing at you and you're apologizing for it.</div></div><hr />

Its just ridiculous how many people get mad at something that isnt a requirement.

4.3 looks to be a great patch. did other expansions have more content than cata? depends on your definition of content really but for the most part yes the other expansions did.<br />

Besides, you know, THE COMPLETE AND TOTAL REDO OF THE 1-60 EXPERIENCE INCLUDING NEW QUESTS AND LANDSCAPES.<br />
<br />
Every idiot who bitches about the fact that an expansion that added only 5 new levels doesn't have enough end game content always forgets that it did a lot more to early game content as well.<br />
<br />
And Nef and Rag, recycled? Are you fucking kidding me? Just because they are the same fucking character doesn't mean its the same fucking content. Compare the Blackwing Lair and Blackwing Descent encounters. They aren't ANY BIT alike. The same applies to quite a few bosses in Shadowfang Keep and Deadmines.<br />

<br />
It is for some, not everyone who plays wow or who has left recently is a raider. Not everything they add has to be a raid or something to do with a raid. Seeing as how there is nothing to do for the non raider atm i don't see adding this type of content as a bad thing. It may not be for you and that's fine. Right now you log into the game to either level a toon, do 5 mans or raid. So there adding something to do on your off time why is that bad? If you don't wanna do it fine if you do well its there for you simple as that.<br />

If you looked at it expansion by expansion, this is the worst expansion by amount of actual content but each time someone brings it up, some Blizzard apologist quickly comes up with some excuse demanding people to stop being so negative. Why? Did your monthly subscription start costing less? Did Cataclysm expansion cost less than the TBC expansion or WotLK expansion?<br />
<br />
TBC gave us nearly 60 raid bosses, a new &quot;planet&quot;, a ton of new dungeons and bosses within, heroics, and love it or hate it gave us arenas and daily BG/honor grinds as a way for PvPers to compete which was also brand new content. WotLK gave us like 45 some raid bosses, a new continent, a handful of new dungeons, and it gave casuals a way to gear up with the Argent Tournament.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm will end up giving us 20? some raid bosses and at least 2 end ones so far have been recycled (Nef and Ragnaros), 7 new dungeons and recycled for us Shadowfang Keep and Deadmines, recycled ZA and ZG and called them &quot;new&quot;, gave us like 5 new zones. The content is so lacking, in fact, that Blizzard apologists are so desperate that you're willing to latch on to a side event like the Darkmoon Faire and call it &quot;content&quot;? Oh look it adds a mount ooooh. And some companion pets. Oooooh. So a billion dollar company took a year to add 1 mount and some companion pets? This is what you accept as content now when you are paying the same price? Your bar is so low?<br />
<br />
They're not even bothering trying to put out new content because they decided that after 5 years of saying they didn't want you changing how you looked, they reneged and introduced transmogrification and you said HOORAY. So the &quot;new content&quot; of Cataclysm is you going back to do level 60 raids to get the gear you sold 4 years ago, that way, they don't have to make any new things for you because you're too busy going HEHEHE LETS GET THE OLD STUFF AGAIN THAT I FARMED BEFORE.<br />
<br />
This is why the game is dumbed down. Because Blizzard keeps lowering the bar and instead of getting an outcry, you just nod and lower your expectations below their bar and accept what they gave you. Giving you less and less each year but trying to squeeze out more microtransactions, and you keep paying for extra while accepting less for the same price you've been paying.<br />
<br />
It's absurd. And stupid.<br />
<br />
Content? It's not content. It's laughing at you and you're apologizing for it.<br />
<br />
I agree with pretty much all of this statement 100%. I strongly believe that Blizz knows they didnt do as well with Cata as they could have. I think they are wrapping up the Exp with some small fun things in 4.3 and will try to release MOP (or whatever it might be) sooner than expected to kind of plug the dam if you shall. I do think people forget about all the 1-60 content they changed, which was great and was a lot of work Im sure but did nothing for people in end game. The recycling of dungeons was kind of lazy, but it isnt the first time they have done it (im looking at you LK Naxx, and Onyxia). No company I can think of can release a diamond every time. Apple has filed before, lord knows MS has failed before (ME, Vista) and several others. Unfortunately all the petty screaming 12-15 year olds hold Blizz on too high of a pedestal and the only way to please those people is go F2P, release a patch every week, and have 900+ playable different classes and make sure not a single one is too OP</div></div><hr />

Transformawhatever and Darkfare are prob the 2 greatest patch notes I have seen in years.It does not sound like just a daily hub.. actually sounds like alot of fun and bringing back a new gurabshi arena souds epic.Cataclysm may = dissapointmentbut 4.3 = best best patch ever by far</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
You're being ridiculous. You are forcing the idea that only your idea of fun is, in fact, fun. I happen to enjoy Cataclysm. You can call me a &quot;Blizzard Apologist&quot; (what the hell does that even mean?) all you want, but my enjoyment is my enjoyment. <br />
<br />
The Burning Crusade gave lots of raid bosses. Yep. Big deal. Everyone saw every single one right? They all had fun and interesting mechanics, right? Were they fun, yes. Does the amount of them make for fun? I don't think so. You can prefer quantity, I prefer quality. You can try and argue that Firelands is shit since it only has 7 bosses, but really, they are all pretty unique. Lord Rhyolith, while I despise the fight, it's not like anything else that we've seen. Staghelm and Alysrazor are completely different than anything else. Atramedes was pretty damn neat. Conclave of Wind is probably one of my favourite fights to date. <br />
<br />
Recycled content? Seriously, stop with that fucking word. How similar are the new Deadmines and Shadowfang Keep to the originals? They have the same setting? Got it. How about Zul'Gurub? Same setting? Got it. You basically flat out said you just want more bosses. Well, these are more bosses. Yet you hate it because these bosses are in a place you visited 6 years ago. Got it. Throw the word recycled around all you like, it doesn't make the dungeons any less fun. Was the new Deadmines on heroic terrible? Nope. Not at all. Vanessa VanCleef and Cookie were really cool and fun encounters. I loved them.<br />
<br />
Why is it you're screaming that Cataclysm has less content? What do you call content? Just raid bosses? Then, by gum, you're right! It has less raid bosses. Ergo, it's terrible and has no content. You're opinion. I've had loads of fun with this expansion. Just because you haven't, doesn't mean others don't enjoy it. <br />
<br />
Transmogrification does excite me. I get tired of seeing my clones everywhere. I'd like to actually roleplay in the roleplaying game we all play. Nuts, I know. And guess what, I'm not even raiding anymore. My guild decided we'd had enough. So now I'm just enjoying the content in questing and PvP. This new Darkmoon Faire will add a fun and unique experience at the start of each month from now on. You don't like it? That sucks. You get your Deathwind raid though. Why the hell do you hate on one aspect of the patch so much when there is already a really good piece coming your way? <br />
<br />
The game is not dumbed down. Why do you say it is? I'm pretty sure stat priorities and reforging and all the other stuff they've thrown in has made managing your character far more complex than ever before. Raid content is much more difficult than ever before. (Though, since we're all Dragonslaying Firelord Gladiators that are Insane and ride around on a giant Robot Head that's pretty Invincible here on MMO-Champion, I guess we wouldn't notice.) My server's top guild is 2/7 heroic. Sinestra was only just downed recently. What exactly was &quot;dumbed&quot; down? <br />
<br />
Content? It's content! I'm laughing and having fun and you're pouting over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TBC did have about 52. He exaggerated slightly, but I won't fault him for it. TBC did have more bosses than Cataclysm has had so far. You know, since it's not even completed. And the amount of bosses is really all that matters.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keLston</div><div class="date">2011-08-25, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And Nef and Rag, recycled? Are you fucking kidding me? Just because they are the same fucking character doesn't mean its the same fucking content. Compare the Blackwing Lair and Blackwing Descent encounters. They aren't ANY BIT alike. The same applies to quite a few bosses in Shadowfang Keep and Deadmines.<br />
<br />
Stop acting like you know shit, because you clearly don't.<br />
<br />
The question is, do you? Have you even done Rag? I'm 6/7H. What are you? You're praising the 1-60 redo lol, so you must be some rando casual. Rag is pmuch the same except he hits harder. He does a knockback, he summons sons, he even submerges. The difference is, you hit him from the front the entire time. Is the fight harder? Sure. But don't kid yourself if the fight is somehow novel or new.<br />
<br />
And really? Oh man, they redid 1-60 that takes 20 minutes to go through and all the zones are empty and you get idiots in your level 85 group who do 600 dps because hunters use expertise. AWESOME LEVEL 1-60 BRO. YOU DID IT. CONGRATS. With a billion dollars, it only took you 5 and a half years to revamp this content that has been sitting here.<br />
<br />
I hope you could update a god damned quest that tells you to collect 10 bear asses with a billion dollars within 5 years.<br />
<br />
<br />
100% agreed, also Ragnaros heroic was one of if not the hardest encounter Blizz has ever made Dumbed down&quot; i think not.<br />
<br />
Forcing raid stacking to make an encounter hard doesn't make an encounter new, unique, or exciting. It simply makes it tediously stupid.<br />
<br />
Bulldozing a brickwall using your face is hard too. But doing so is still dumb. Therefore, just because HM Ragnaros is &quot;hard&quot; isn't indicative of anything. It's not skillfully hard. It's tediously hard.<br />
<br />
There's a reason the few 10mans that actually have managed to pull off a HM Rags kill are the ones that have access to a 25+ man bench and can do things like throw down 2 hunters and 2 frost DKs and call it a normal raid setup (one Korean guild with a 10m H Rags kill did this).</div></div><hr />

Only thing I don't agree here is Nefarian and Ragnaros being rehashes, from the moment you had your way with them in vanilla with all the breadcrumb quests around it hinted at possible returns, one being the element of necromancy giving way for Deathwing raising his son back from the grave with his possible return and Ragnaros being an elemental lord as every other of them, is only killable in his domain. Normally, the game and the expansions should have lined up as:<br />
<br />
Vanilla, WotLK, Cataclysm, South Seas/Naz'jatar and then places in Twisting Nether, yet due to the ever crying, non-quest description reading and shiny-loving and overestimating idiots this community has contained Blizzard have screwed up the game, right now I'm not even waiting for the Blizzcon announcements, all I'm waiting for is my guild to find a proper replacement in place of mine, then I'll take my leave, not for another MMO of course, because what we have(and will have, SWTOR or GW2 eg) won't be what WoW was supposed to me as from what I've seen so far, the companies are blinded with their greed to the point now where they are aiming to gain money and forgetting to make the game. What I mean here is that, it should be a strong story driving the game not a fragile gameplay, yet they're just too lazy and extremely greedy(as every company is) to do that...<br />
<br />
The problem in the end is Blizzard not trying to listen to the community, but trying to silence some annoying brats, they know it and do it and most of you ignore it while some are still crying on it.<br />
<br />
This DMF Island being another artificially gated grind, is a state-of-the-art proof to my argument.<br />
<br />
Criers continue to cry, lawyers on with your advocation and ignorers, words are lost on you either way...<br />

<br />
Also you don't have to use transmog its for people who like the look of the old gear its not like they aren't adding new gear.<br />
<br />
I never say this because its usually BS but seriously if you don't like the game stop playing and stop looking at websites about the game that you supposedly hate.</div></div><hr />

Well, I'm sure as hell it will be a big ass grind with some gimmicks to keep people hooked, that's what blizzard always does. Then again, not because there are new dailies and whatnot it means you HAVE to do them. For instance, I only got the blacksmith patterns because a friend needed them, I got them to never set a foot on the molten front, and don't even get me started on Tol Barad.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malygos The Spellweaver</div><div class="date">2011-08-25, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The question is, do you? Have you even done Rag? I'm 6/7H. What are you? You're praising the 1-60 redo lol, so you must be some rando casual. Rag is pmuch the same except he hits harder. He does a knockback, he summons sons, he even submerges. The difference is, you hit him from the front the entire time. Is the fight harder? Sure. But don't kid yourself if the fight is somehow novel or new.<br />
<br />
And really? Oh man, they redid 1-60 that takes 20 minutes to go through and all the zones are empty and you get idiots in your level 85 group who do 600 dps because hunters use expertise. AWESOME LEVEL 1-60 BRO. YOU DID IT. CONGRATS. With a billion dollars, it only took you 5 and a half years to revamp this content that has been sitting here.<br />
<br />
I hope you could update a god damned quest that tells you to collect 10 bear asses with a billion dollars within 5 years.<br />
<br />
Did you join in Cataclysm or what? If you had any idea of the 1-60 content before Cataclysm, it was a complete and total pain in the ass. It was boring, outdated, and everyone longed for the day they got to 58 so they could get to Outland. Blizzard updated this to the point that everyone dreads going to Outland now because the content THERE isn't half as interesting or fun as the 1-60 content.<br />
<br />
Clearly you are &quot;LEET HARDCORE RAIDAR&quot; which means you only appreciate your end game content. Thank god, you are not the only kind of player in WoW. Hard to believe, I know. And, Ragnaros, the same? LOL. 6/7H? That statement alone seems to point to &quot;hasn't got a character past level 40&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Cataclysm is now more of a necro-expansion figuratively speaking then Wrath was literally speaking!Look, I know people are going to enjoy this, and that's great. I'm glad people are going to get something out of the second coming of the Darkmoon. But that doesn't change the fact that it's still just the Darkmoon faire, updated. It's not a new idea. I did this the first time it came out, like I did most everything else they've brought back this expansion. Also, people getting angry at the naysayers have to understand that this isn't going to be everyones cup of tea.It just sounds to me like they tossed as many cool ideas as they could into the faire ((Dancing bears! Fez wearing monkies! Old armor sets for our NEW transmogrifying! GURUBASHI 2.0!)) in an attempt to catch peoples attention and to try to slow the hemorraghing subs.</div></div><hr />

Two things you didn't have to do, you wanted to do molten front to help your friend and you wanted to do Tol Barad. i didn't do Tol Barad did i miss something? NOPE <br />

Blizzard: MORE DAILIES!<br />

Blizzard: We give you more bosses. And more bosses! And more Bosses.<br />
Non-raidres: Man this game sucks. Thats not content.<br />
Raiders: Shut the fuck up and get out of our game.<br />
Blizzard is doing a great job creating content for all. They even added a pvp deathmatch pit. Still pvp players can use a lot more love. Stop forcing your idea of fun and content on other people. Theres more to this than just pets and old armors sets. Just like theirs more to raiding than gear.</div></div><hr />

Well this doesn't seem to be built around dailies. It clearly says you can do everything as much as you want. You could get what you're after in a day probably! Seems anti-grindy to me. It mostly just seems like something you by to have fun in and get rewarded with free items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been playing since my server went live. It wasn't quite an original (Eredar launched 3 days after the official WoW launch).<br />
<br />
Just for you, from our guild's hunter. He joined us in BWL:<br />
<br />
http://k.min.us/ib8Yfu.jpg<br />
<br />
So the question still is, what have you done? You're clearly a nobody that hasn't seen any of the actual content to get excited over 1-60 revamps and DMF islands.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RincrowTheOmnipotent</div><div class="date">2011-08-25, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're being ridiculous. You are forcing the idea that only your idea of fun is, in fact, fun. I happen to enjoy Cataclysm. You can call me a &quot;Blizzard Apologist&quot; (what the hell does that even mean?) all you want, but my enjoyment is my enjoyment. <br />
<br />
The Burning Crusade gave lots of raid bosses. Yep. Big deal. Everyone saw every single one right? They all had fun and interesting mechanics, right? Were they fun, yes. Does the amount of them make for fun? I don't think so. You can prefer quantity, I prefer quality. You can try and argue that Firelands is shit since it only has 7 bosses, but really, they are all pretty unique. Lord Rhyolith, while I despise the fight, it's not like anything else that we've seen. Staghelm and Alysrazor are completely different than anything else. Atramedes was pretty damn neat. Conclave of Wind is probably one of my favourite fights to date. <br />
<br />
Recycled content? Seriously, stop with that fucking word. How similar are the new Deadmines and Shadowfang Keep to the originals? They have the same setting? Got it. How about Zul'Gurub? Same setting? Got it. You basically flat out said you just want more bosses. Well, these are more bosses. Yet you hate it because these bosses are in a place you visited 6 years ago. Got it. Throw the word recycled around all you like, it doesn't make the dungeons any less fun. Was the new Deadmines on heroic terrible? Nope. Not at all. Vanessa VanCleef and Cookie were really cool and fun encounters. I loved them.<br />
<br />
Why is it you're screaming that Cataclysm has less content? What do you call content? Just raid bosses? Then, by gum, you're right! It has less raid bosses. Ergo, it's terrible and has no content. You're opinion. I've had loads of fun with this expansion. Just because you haven't, doesn't mean others don't enjoy it. <br />
<br />
Transmogrification does excite me. I get tired of seeing my clones everywhere. I'd like to actually roleplay in the roleplaying game we all play. Nuts, I know. And guess what, I'm not even raiding anymore. My guild decided we'd had enough. So now I'm just enjoying the content in questing and PvP. This new Darkmoon Faire will add a fun and unique experience at the start of each month from now on. You don't like it? That sucks. You get your Deathwind raid though. Why the hell do you hate on one aspect of the patch so much when there is already a really good piece coming your way? <br />
<br />
The game is not dumbed down. Why do you say it is? I'm pretty sure stat priorities and reforging and all the other stuff they've thrown in has made managing your character far more complex than ever before. Raid content is much more difficult than ever before. (Though, since we're all Dragonslaying Firelord Gladiators that are Insane and ride around on a giant Robot Head that's pretty Invincible here on MMO-Champion, I guess we wouldn't notice.) My server's top guild is 2/7 heroic. Sinestra was only just downed recently. What exactly was &quot;dumbed&quot; down? <br />
<br />
Content? It's content! I'm laughing and having fun and you're pouting over it. 100% agree on every single point. Also a lot of the BC bosses where the same fights just with different names. It was rare to find bosses with unique mechanics. Cata is filled with them.<br />
Why do people play something if they don't even enjoy it? Its unhealthy.</div></div><hr />

There's just no pleasing people. XD People should go back in time to the end of BC and go to all the WoW fansites. Its was just filled with bitching about how BC sucked. Wrath was another bitch fest and so was Cata. I despise gamers. They are an unhappy bunch.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't stop the fact that blizzard re did all the 1-60 content cause people were asking for it. just Like reforging, transmogrification, old world flying etc.<br />
Or the fact that everything blizzard ever adds to the game doesn't have to be strictly raiding, why can't there be other things to do even if there optional? We'll still get our raid in the end so who cares?</div></div><hr />
