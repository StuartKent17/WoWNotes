Upcoming Raid Testing - December 13<br />
On Tuesday, December 13, we will be conducting focused raid tests of Heroic Nighthold bosses.<br />
<br />
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for groups between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. <br />
<br />
Tuesday, December 13<br />
<br />
Elisande – Heroic Nighthold<br />
13:30 PST (16:30 EST, 22:30 CET)<br />
<br />
Gul'dan – Heroic Nighthold<br />
15:00 PST (18:00 EST, 24:00 CET)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />

We definitely understand that Marksmanship Hunters were used to a version of Vulnerable on live that was, for all practical purposes, full uptime (i.e. it could be up for every or virtually every Aimed Shot). Skilled players will still be able to have a great majority of their Aimed Shots affected by Vulnerable even in 7.1.5, albeit with a higher demand on focus management and good use of Windburst. That is intended, even if it involves losing a degree of comfort in essentially never being without a Vulnerable when you want it. The debuff is less diluted and has more significance when it requires that sort of attention, and it is not without payoff: the damage of an Aimed Shot with Vulnerable is significantly higher than in 7.1, and can be further increased with the new Patient Sniper. The ability to use Piercing Shot with Vulnerable (and potentially Patient Sniper) is an example of a new option allowing a very strong burst.<br />
<br />
While the fundamental mechanic driving it is a proc, the proc rate is quite high, and our goal is to make sure it is the sort of randomness that provides variation to a rotation while allowing responsive gameplay and room for mastery. The ability to wait on a Hunter's Mark while pooling focus to get full value from the Vulnerable will be more important than before. Windburst, as well as the talent options Sidewinders and Sentinel, allow on-demand Vulnerables as a resource to deal with situations where you have focus but not a Mark (or simply to make sure you have one for a key burst moment without having to react to a proc). Finally, removing the Vulnerable requirement for Marked Shot to do strong damage removes a reliance on multiple rapid procs and/or Sidewinders in order to use consistent buffed Marked Shots.<br />
<br />
As the PTR goes on, we welcome feedback on what problems turn up when you try to put this into practice, but I wanted to explain a bit more what our expectation was.

Cheat Death at 6 minutes is ridiculous... At the very least they need to make it reset on death, or no one is going to use it.<br />
It does.<br />
<br />
To say a bit more on the 7.1.5 changes to various “cheat death” effects, including Cheat Death, Cauterize, Purgatory, and Last Resort: firstly, the cooldown increase is not the only change—the cooldowns (specifically, the cooldown-enforcing debuffs) will now clear on death. So if you Cheat Death early in a dungeon, yes, you should avoid dying again for the next 6 minutes. However, in the event you do die (or the group wipes), you will return to combat with Cheat Death once again available.<br />
<br />
More broadly, we examined the value of these effects as a whole and concluded they are too easily available. When Cheat Death was first added as a deep Subtlety talent (before the change to modern talent rows), its power and cooldown reflected the significant investment into that tree. In the current game, not only is its opportunity cost much lower, but, taking a look at the gameplay of healing and survivability challenges, the power level of such a frequent extra life is very high. For example, Rebirth has a 10 minute cooldown, and is a distinctively powerful ability that significantly contributes to a class’s perceived power in dungeons. Reincarnation has a 30 minute cooldown, and is far from being meaningless or forgotten. If we were adding Cheat Death and its ilk today and evaluating its power, there would be little justification for a cooldown as short as 2 minutes. Preventing a death that might otherwise have scuttled the entire current attempt at a dungeon or raid boss has more value than that.<br />
<br />
On Last Resort in particular, we are aware that Vengeance Demon Hunters felt somewhat reliant on this to avoid deaths to unexpected burst damage, and we will be monitoring whether they need other changes to compensate (for example, they have increased health on PTR, increased baseline damage reduction, and a stronger Metamorphosis effect). And on Purgatory, its cooldown was increased the least because it conditional, and it was also made more reliable: the effect will now always last for 3 seconds regardless of whether you momentarily go above 0 HP during that window.

One problem that Destruction Warlock had was a number of talent rows with very obvious &quot;single-target&quot; vs. &quot;AoE&quot; talent picks. This has clear downsides--a requirement to swap talents often (and as a corollary, a feeling of being significantly crippled when not using the ideal talent loadout for a given situation). Clearly, it's a DPS loss single-target to say you can no longer have both Eradication and Reverse Entropy, and a DPS loss in some AoE situations to say you can no longer have both Cataclysm and Fire and Brimstone. But making that swap, and then making sure throughout PTR that Destruction DPS remains reasonably consistent with live, will leave the spec more well-rounded and not as pigeonholed by talent choices in a given situation. PTR already has buffs to Doomguard and Imp damage that help with numbers in all situations, as well as buffs to various talents to help futher improve flexibility.

I dont see any articles praising alcoholics for drinking x l of vodka. Cause thats what it is - gaming addiction, and many blind people stil dont care cause its a new sickness.<br />
As i said in previous thread (that was locked), it doesnt take any skill, it doesnt even take any effort, the only achievement in this is that the guy spent most of his life since 31st August in the game, which is sad and alarming and has nothing to do with being jealous or bitter.<br />

I can have all the time and can go over and over again because even monkey can learn same things repeating them again and again. But who with normal brain would do that? Who would like to have a kid who is slave to this? I agree he deserves achievement, achievement where he realises what he is achieving right now in his life. Wow is nice game but this is not good.

You forget 1 major thing. It's his job and he is making a decent living out of it. If you're arguing that a job where you sit behind a computer all day is bad, then I suggestion you go talk to the millions of people in this world that only sit behind a computerdesk for their job.</div></div><hr />

He's actually an electrician, if you read his twitch. So he is/has done &quot;useful&quot; things. Apparently he has had a ton of time to play recently because of an illness according to his bio on twitch. So he has a &quot;real&quot; job since you don't consider streaming a job. Which I would have to disagree with since top streamers make quite a lot of money. If you are getting money while streaming, by either people donating or having a sub button, it's a job. Might not be a full-time job for most but it's still a job if you get paid in my book. <br />
<br />
Also, he is done farming AP for that weapon. Forever. Meanwhile, people will still be grinding out their AP for months and months. Some people might not even finish. For those months, he could do something other than farm AP if he wants. Maybe he wants to farm AP for another weapon. Take a vacation. Who cares. It's his life. He will do what he wants regardless of your opinion. Your argument that is this is a detriment to his life and a bad example for other players is a huge stretch. You know absolutely nothing about his life and just make assumptions about him. <br />
<br />
I didn't realize you were a doctor and could make a statement that he has a mental disorder. Just because someone plays video games a lot does not mean they have a mental disorder. They &quot;could&quot; have one. But I &quot;could&quot; also be the Pope for all you know. There is no possible way you could diagnose that. You also imply he plays 16 hours a day but I can't find a source for that. Care to enlighten me where you found that information?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I think I know why, it is because the people who are doing the verbal bashing, berating and hating are just jealous because they know that they will never achieve anything in their sad pathetic lives, so they have to hate on someone who has achieved something, just to make themselves feel good..</div></div><hr />

Well to fair almost anyone can work in sewers, but not everyone can be an artist or atleast a good one. Also why can't you have both? That is what I was trying to say to that guy, just because you think X person is useless for you, doesn't mean they are useless to another person. I don't watch streams and I don't like em in general, but that doesn't mean it is not a real job. I recommend watch the movie After the Dark (2013), it deals with exactly those questions with people stuck in bunker in post apocalyptic world trying to decide who to allow to stay in said bunker due to limited resources and while you need engineers and such, almost anyone can work in the sewers while artist can help alleviate stress.</div></div><hr />

you get less ap for doing the lower ones, so you would aim to speed run maw 8 plus's for maximum AP effeciency. At least that's what I would assume anyway.</div></div><hr />

Uhm no.Since 2 weeks ago there was a hidden cap on the number of legendaries that can drop for 1 character which was 4.Blizzard admitted that aswell.<br />
So the guy farmed 2000 mythics while having 4, and 0 chance on finding the 5th.My guess is that he got the 5th after Blizzard removed the hidden cap.<br />

Actually there was a SOFT cap, not a cap. It just means that the &quot;protection&quot; was working only for the 1st 4 legendaries you get, you can get 10 legendaries after that but with the original drop rate, which probably is 0.00000000001% or less :P</div></div><hr />

This is so important... the legendary drop rate is so broken that without luck protection is almost impossible to get a drop... they designed it so badly that you NEED bad luck protection or you're screwed.

So why do you must have legendaries it seems to me to be more like the molten core legendary drop rates that if you had bad luck you didn't see the item dropping for all the time you where raiding it.<br />

<br />
How does he stream for a living? I'm at this Twitch channel and I don't see a subscriber button, donate, ads or promotions. Am I missing something about how he makes a living off streaming?</div></div><hr />

I would probably go batshit crazy sitting in front of wow 14 hours a day grinding out dungeons over and over and over. Hell I did a charity marathon this weekend and did 20 M+'s and I was SO done by the time it was over. If that's his thing, then good for him.</div></div><hr />

Also - 'lower' is relative.<br />
<br />
There's no reason to 3 chest anymore if you are only doing them to farm AP. They nerfed the 3-chest AP farming method a couple months ago. You used to get the AP items out of all 3 chests (2 each for a total of 6 iirc), that's why people speed ran low M+ for 3 chests. Now you only get 2 AP items out of the main chest and nothing but gold (or gear) out of the other 2.</div></div><hr />

1. Didn't realise that, thanks<br />
2. I'm sure he started his farming well before the nerf<br />
3. Speed still is a benefit.</div></div><hr />

Yeah people were able to farm ludicrous amounts of AP before they nerfed it. The butter zone now is +4. Reason being that they changed the AP items in the main chest (with the nerf I mentioned) so that the higher the + the higher the amount of AP that is awarded from those items. Thing is that they are in brackets. This is what they are now:<br />
<br />
Mythic 2-3: 500 base Artifact Power<br />
Mythic 4-6: 800 base Artifact Power<br />
Mythic 7-9: 1000 base Artifact Power<br />
Mythic 10+: 1200 base Artifact Power<br />
<br />
You can see why +4 would be a butter zone. It can be argued that +7 can also be a butter zone if you have your own crew of 4 and just set up a group finder group with something like: &quot;LF1M +7 carry, your stone&quot;. Just grab 1 pug with a +7 stone through the group finder, clear their +7 in 3-chest time, jump back in group finder to look for another person with a +7 stone, rinse and repeat all day long.</div></div><hr />

Dude, if you're going to insult someone at least put some effort into fixing all of the grammatical errors and misspellings. I can't believe people still don't know the difference between &quot;your&quot; and &quot;you're&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unbelievr</div><div class="date">2016-12-12, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I happen to know this guy and have boosted a tiny fragment of the total dungeons he has ran, and feel I should clarify:<br />
- No, he does not stream for a living. He recently started streaming Mythic raids, as one of the most consistently good players (across expansions) for guilds that raid 2 times a week.<br />
- He mostly runs M6-9 Maw of Souls, Darkheart Thicket or Court of Stars. Maw keys are heavily contested by other boost groups, so they are hard to come by. It's also a limited amount of slots for trinkets/gear that drops in those dungeons, so he can't have titanforged+socket in every slot. With easier affixes, e.g. sanguine+overflowing, he runs almost every dungeon for variety.<br />
- Yes, he is legit. He usually works as an electrician, but has been ill for some time, and thus played more than the average player.<br />
- He has not been alone in attempting this. There's been a few others that were fighting for the #1 spot, and they would overtake each other while some were sleeping. Cerli was also dethroned after having to basically log off for a week, but worked hard to regain the lead. (He actually saved up a ton of AP tokens to fake a smaller lead, then used them all at the same time to jump far ahead and discourage the competitors).<br />
<br />
Basically, he has made running late night M+ boost groups into an art form. His boost groups know every single pull, cooldown/trinket to swap to and has seen almost every screw-up possible and can handle it. It's super efficient, but still very relaxed. We talk on discord, joke and laugh, and it takes very little mental effort to run the dungeons after some time. He usually has an enormous queue of people who want to join his groups, because you know what you'll get.</div></div><hr />

My point, though, is that it is specifically his/her opinion. I doubt Cerli considered it a waste of time, or he wouldn't have done it at all, and probably could not care less what an edgy anon on the Web thinks of how he spent that time. I don't particularly care about the accomplishment, either, but I don't post on MMO-C simply to be condescending and thus prove that I am somehow the better person for behaving as a snooty prat.</div></div><hr />
