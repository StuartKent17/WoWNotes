Dragon Soul LFR Testing Now Open (10/26)<br />
The first half of Dragon Soul is now testable through LFR. If you're level 85 and have an average item level above 365, you will be able to queue for the Siege of Wyrmrest Temple. The second LFR entry for the later half of the raid is not yet available.<br />
<br />
This is VERY much a work in progress, the UI is in an unpolished state right now. Give it a try though! <br />
<br />
<br />

Pandas? Why??<br />
Blizzard has given the Panderan a rich culture and a specific way of thinking. A history that goes back beyond the sundering with their own struggles and accomplishments. They have an identity beyond &quot;Look, its Pandas.&quot;<br />
This is something I want to touch on a bit more. People seem to think that Pandaren were a joke, a throw away easter egg that we never fully intended as a playable race.<br />
<br />
I will direct you to recall the Warcraft RPG (pen and paper) manuals released in 2003. While much of it hasn't been canon for quite some time, the Pandaren occupy a greater amount of pages and space within the manuals to establish their lore and story than pretty much every other creature on Azeroth. To give it some context, they occupy the same number of pages as Trolls in the Monster Manual, and share the same amount space in the Alliance and Horde Compendium with Orcs or Humans, and just like them ... you guessed it... Pandaren were a playable race.<br />
<br />
(there's also an awesome sketch Metzen did of a Pandaren, Dwarf, Furbolg, and Gnome hanging out all friendly-like)<br />
<br />
As I said a lot of this was pre-World of Warcraft, and by whatever stroke of fate, Trolls and Forsaken became playable races and Pandaren, Naga, and Furbolgs did not. Some other mix could have just as easily been true, and no one would have questioned it. Worgen didn't even exist back then, of course, they were a new creation for World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
It would simply be inaccurate to state that Pandaren were a throw away. Our intent, going back to Warcraft III, when the vast majority of the world lore and story was established for the franchise, was always to have a deep and rich history for a race known as the Pandaren.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowpedia.org/File:Heroraces.jpg?c=1 There's the pic.<br />
Haha, yup, that's the one. Thank you. And this is actually a great resource covering the contents of the manuals, just please keep in mind that much of it is now highly inaccurate and the visual style of the Pandaren have changed quite a bit since then.<br />

Yeah, but i would think a mage can manipulate time through magic since he has abilities like time warp etc, the cog wheels suggest something like engineering :confused:</div></div><hr />

Don't have much experience with art concepts do you? These arent good the only one that even comes close to resembling 4.3 is the warrior. Looks like deathwing. Druid looks like mushroom abusers. Mage looks like a garment and eng would were. Lock looks KINDA cool and has some resemblance to the twilight council. Hunter looks like a rebel doesnt match anything really.

<br />
I believe the majority of the player base would prefer sets that reflect their class, as opposed to the current raid/content. The mage set was designed with Time Warp in mind, Druids with their new mushroom ability (cant remember the name atm), etc. So, while you think these are bad concepts, you are in the minority. I suggest you try to start thinking outside of the box instead of bashing aesthetically pleasing designs for not conforming to your notions of what a tier design should be; after all, the past few tiers that they based on current content proved to be a &quot;flop&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh and yeah, I knew warlocks would have some wicked colors right there. KA-BOOOW.<br />
<br />
I hope Blizzard's still gonna add those writhing tentacles.. or I'll have to call Faceless Shroud a cake.<br />
<br />
Despite static tentacles, I still think (and I was already a fan of the first coloration of the set, which everyone thought was a clown set) the new colors make it a 100% better fit and will surely be my favorite set.<br />
<br />
Sorry T8,5 Conqueror's Deathbringer.. you've been beaten out of the water. :&lt;<br />

And the other colors really made me appreciate the other sets ALOT more. Good job Blizzard, and thanks Boub for delivering!</div></div><hr />

Just a &quot;what if&quot; question too you, but. What if the &quot;Heroic version&quot; isnt the red one? I guessing it might be, as seen with the past ... yet blizzard appears to be shuffling up their norm just a tad. So what if the BRIGHT blue one is in fact the heroic one? o.0</div></div><hr />

Actually, if you preview the sets on the WoWhead model viewer, you'll see that a lot of the males in don't get full face masks either. Tauren, Worgen, Goblin, Troll all get eye-masks only - for both male and female. All races of Female priests get half-masks.</div></div><hr />

I prefer the gray/blue coloured rogue set not the red/green combination. Like the priest set too...Wonder how it will look on taurens lol. Paladin is awsome, wasnt sure about the helm tho but it grew on me. Not feeling the mage and druid set..they could have done better. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

whats wrong with the shaman set ? Bones is a shaman thing T_T ...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thetallest</div><div class="date">2011-10-01, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay sorry but I have to rant about this somewhere. Why do some of the female armor sets look completely different from the male sets? Shaman, paladin, and druid, I'm looking at you. And the female warlock looks like she has a giant skin toned tarp over her chest, but at least her chest is covered. What is the deal with the mage set? She's like completely covered and it's almost like the armor team was like, &quot;Well we gotta have women boobage somewhere, give her a random skin patch in the center of her chest hurrhurrr&quot; Really? Was the dimorphism between the sets really necessary? I think everyone liked how they looked during the previews, and I didn't see a SINGLE person complaining that they needed to be sexed up for the lady sets. Why, oh why, did they ruin some perfectly good armor sets on the female models like this? Bad show to blizzard's new armor team. I really liked the designs they had presented during the previews. This just ruined it for me. Contrary to popular belief, WoW armor team, not every armor set needs to have major boobage for the female characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More to add:<br />
The shaman was originally a horde class and that's what it looks like. I love it.<br />
Paladin on the other hand never really fits into the horde, but of course that's just my point of view.<br />
<br />
If I may add, I also love the druid set. Mushrooms is so &quot;nature&quot; and it doesnt look as over the top, as some others.<br />
Warrior is great too, in red and in yellow too, but blue ? Nah.<br />
The sets I like least are Priest, although many seem to like it, Paladin (same as priest) and rogue.<br />
<br />
btw, I really want to see the grey warlock set on the other races.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've actually come to see that Hunter is my least favourite, which pains me because my main is a hunter. It just looks wayy too clunky, the Helmet rediculously huge - SO much so that it looks unbalanced and if you pushed a hunter forward just a bit he'd fall flat on his dragonface that he can barely see out of. The wings could have been cool but look more like a plastic mop bucket that you cut the bottom out with scissors. There is NOTHING attention grabbing below the shoulder+facial area. No lights. No glowey Magic.<br />
<br />
Sucks. Hunter got the short stick - our pvp tier is also the most forgettable design in WoW and looks more like a level 40 lumberjack set from Elwynn FRIGGIN FOREST!<br />

Transmorg isn't just a feature, its a savior.</div></div><hr />

The mage set was designed with Time Warp in mind, Druids with their new mushroom ability (cant remember the name atm), etc. So, while you think these are bad concepts, you are in the minority. I suggest you try to start thinking outside of the box instead of bashing aesthetically pleasing designs for not conforming to your notions of what a tier design should be; after all, the past few tiers that they based on current content proved to be a &quot;flop&quot;.<br />
<br />
You are wrong, i would say it is about 50/50. I play a druid and have read many druid posts MANY. Cause that is what I do as a druid and 75% of the posts I have read do not like the druid set. One mushrooms do not reflect a druid. Yes it is nature but trees,leaves,things that are beautiful in nature is what a druid is about. Mushrooms that grow in dark damp areas are not what a druid is about at all. I suggest YOU think out of the box on how the sets should look. Mage and Time Warping, that is a spell a MAGICAL spell not a TECHNICAL spell so putting cogwheels on a MEDIEVAL tier of armor is stupid. Plain and simple.</div></div><hr />

How do they all look the same? Most of them look much different. Just because there's stitching in some of them doesn't mean they all look alike.<br />

What common item is most readily associated with time? Give you a hint, it starts with cl- and ends on -ock. Hell, even watching any episode or movie that has ever dealt with time shows gears and cogs spinning. So yes, gears and cogs are highly representative of time, especially with the movement shown on the tier.<br />
<br />
Second, saying one piece of nature is somehow more representative of nature than another piece of nature...well, that's just grasping at straws to defend your argument.</div></div><hr />

I've looked at the map on the PTR i must say that the new Raid looks quite boring to me.... almost all encounters are circular rooms, it seems we will be fighting inside something alive like the huge monster in Twilight Highlands.<br />
<br />

BTW Boub since on WE days there's nothing new to post about, you could think to post something regarding the new encounters since they are already in the dungeon journal (all except 2 dragon fights)<br />

or how it sucks the new starfall / wrath animation :(<br />

<br />
Deathwing will be all about hentai tentacles appearing everywhere from his back, living blood that deal damage / heal the boss and adds to explode to destroy his armour. Very Yogg Saronish<br />

I play a druid and have read many druid posts MANY. Cause that is what I do as a druid and 75% of the posts I have read do not like the druid set. One mushrooms do not reflect a druid. Yes it is nature but trees,leaves,things that are beautiful in nature is what a druid is about. Mushrooms that grow in dark damp areas are not what a druid is about at all. I suggest YOU think out of the box on how the sets should look. Mage and Time Warping, that is a spell a MAGICAL spell not a TECHNICAL spell so putting cogwheels on a MEDIEVAL tier of armor is stupid. Plain and simple.<br />
<br />
Except lore has techno magi, genious. and if you think this is a medieval game, are you not paying attention when you play this game? first off even the titans have machinery, did you never play in an area that housed gnomes or goblins?</div></div><hr />

I like how the Warrior set looks more Warlock than the Warlock set. I swear, no love for Locks since Tier 6. Also, the giant chunky belt thing needs to stop, it's not cute kthx.<br />
<br />
<br />
..... it's a *WARLOCK* they aren't suppose to BE cute.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully that one won't be the heroic version or I might have to find my way into a heroid raiding guild just for that.I hate it in blue. But I love it in purple. Funny how changing a set's color can make all he difference in the world (like for example, the blue warrior set? EW!)</div></div><hr />

That looks like the spookiest, most dreadful set that Blizzard has ever made for them. Not only that, but all the sets besides Mage and Druid look unique and badass in their own way. Plus, do you guys really want a beard on the female priest sets?...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thetraveler12</div><div class="date">2011-10-02, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">after all this time they are STILL unable to put the glow effect ON the eyes.. you can clearly see from the side shot that it is, once again, in FRONT of the eyes. And can we PLEASE make the inside of the warrior helm TOTALLY black. It makes it look like you are dead with the pale skin.. but it might be different with the darker skin tones. More complaints in KNOW.. OMG its like complaints dont get things changed for the better sometimes or anything.. *GASP*!!! And the paladin set needs a belt buckle.. and the gems on the leggings are STILL flat and featureless. Jesus wept can we get some leggings that ARENT spandex? yea there is the single piece of armor sticking out but thats it. It is HIGHTIME Blizzard does something about the look or armor sets beside focusing on the Helms and shoulders.. the rest of the set pieces look terrible as usual. I would rather LESS detail on helms and shoulders and more detail on the rest of hte set pieces. might be nice to see my toons wearing more than socks that are just CALLED plate. 90% of them DON'T look like boots. OMG art department might have to work a little harder than they are? well guess what people.. thats what they ***ing get paid to do. innovate.. work harder to make people want to keep paying for the game. lacklust set pieces are a sign of lazyiness. And it hasn't changed in HOW long?but im just an angry whiner who pays blizzard for a game im clearly unhappy with mirite? yea whatever but the truth is still them being lazy with not taking all pieces of a set and treating tham as individual and unique to each class in regards to design. oh a pretty texture.. spread out like soft butter on a piece of toast.. no longer a pretty texture.</div></div><hr />
