The Patch 4.1 PTR Notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160430/patch-41-public-test-realm-notes-april-12) have been updated to reflect the changes from the latest PTR build.<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Dungeon Finder<br />
<br />
Players will now get bonus rewards 7 times per week (while earning less than 980 Valor Points) instead of once a day when using Dungeon Finder.<br />
When there is only 1 player left in a Dungeon Finder group, they will now be able to queue for replacements as long as they queue within 2 minutes or stay in the dungeon.<br />
Once the dungeon is completed the eligible player will receive a Satchel of Exotic Mysteries (account bound) with various potential rewards including: gold, rare gems, non-combat pets, and (very rare) mounts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guilds<br />

User Interface<br />
<br />
The Network category contains the options &quot;Optimize network for speed&quot; and &quot;Enable IPv6 when available&quot;. &quot;Optimize network for speed&quot; will be enabled by default, and will send packets more frequently at the cost of higher bandwidth. The higher bandwidth may lead to disconnects for some players who have limited bandwidth. Players getting disconnected frequently should try unchecking this box.<br />

<br />
<br />
I dont think that is what it means: &quot;the eligible&quot; player will still only be the one (or ones) on Call to Arms - even if they joined later. <br />
<br />
They made this change so the groups that fell apart after 2nd boss can still finish the run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That'll help with all the bad tanks that are going to start flooding the queue - and since you're already in the dungeon, I'd imagine you'd get priority in re-assembling a group, even if you're by yourself. And it gives dps a chance at a bag. I like that.<br />
<br />
EDIT: NVM, re-read 'eligible' player, meaning you'd still have to be the CTA role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the satchel is going to be BoA. Not the loot inside it, im sure you can open it, if it doesnt become soulbound by then, and look what's inside it.<br />
However, if you got a tank alt.. just send all your satchels to your main if you're hoping for a mount. Anything else from the bags are going to be AH selling stuff or vendor trash. Maybe the odd non-combat pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the misleading word is &quot;once' in the 3rd bullet point, because when you read the notes, you (rightfully) make the assumption that it is continuation of the previous sentence and that &quot;lonesome&quot; player gets the bag. <br />
<br />
they wanna fix the problem when 4 players leave the group pissed off for whatever reason, the 5th one can finish if they wanna wait for new members, whereas now you are automatically &quot;kicked&quot; out of the group too (party has disbanded).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only person to get the satchel is the person (or people) who queued as Call to Arms specs. It has nothing to do with the note saying that if 4 people leave, the last person can requeue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would really like to know ...<br />
<br />
It is the same as all other BoA items: Bound to the server.<br />
<br />
Until they solve the multitude of hardware issues (ie: identifying the target character name + server name, with no typos, is correct and on your account, before even being sent, to ensure it doesn't get lost in the system, since not all the WoW servers are centrally located in 1 housing, more like 5-6 just for the North American servers alone. For Europe, then you gotta factor language in too.) cross-server BoA mailing won't happen.<br />
<br />
The nearest thing I can see is cross-server but within the same battlegroup at this time, being the next likely step.</div></div><hr />

You will still get the loot confirmation on soul bound items looted from the bag (say the item will become bound to you, confirm) so it shouldnt matter if you have autoloot on</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im assuming in this case it will be bound to account and on the server. Much like the current status of the heirloom items. Liking this change so I no longer have to queue as a tank to get fast queues when I want to dps. I will however be much more inclined to tank heroics now since the bag is account bound. Don't really care for my warrior anymore and would definately like to get the mounts for my priest when the CTA is not healers.</div></div><hr />

Why don't they just seperate the PvE and PvP mechanics like people have been crying out for for years now? Surely its not THAT hard!

I still don't see the point of satchel. Anyone who has been farming Raven Lord, Rivendale Charger etc for years know it will on average take 100 runs or more to get 1 mount. <br />
100 runs of a 3min lvl 45 / 70 /80 heroic is fine, 100 runs wiping with scrubs for about 100 hours to get one mount is not.</div></div><hr />

Blizz milking the last pennies from WoW with an incompetent dev team that don´t have a friggin clue how to balance classes. Balancing issues coming from PvE vs PvP have never been this bad. It seems as if they just tunnel vision 1 part of the game and try to balance around that with absolutely no regard for the other part, alternating between PvE and PvP. With the Z-team devs and skeleton crew left behind on WoW the balance is actually only getting worse for each patch they put out.. Sad really when there has always been a straight forward solution right in front of them.</div></div><hr />

Wow...are you being serious? Rogues have a passive snare that's better than most(all?) in the game. Also, a rogue's GCD is shorter than a warrior's.</div></div><hr />

It scales fairly well, with 372 gear it starts to not be that horrible. 100% is wwwwwayyyy to much and i reckon It will be facestomped back into the ground so quickly once people start doing 23k to 30k (crits) swipes under berzerk (more in 5 mans!). Even if berserk no longer cuts swipe cost in half its to much. <br />

Very nice change especially for the DPS and the scenario of <br />
- Joining after a 40min queue <br />
- During a fight <br />
- Group wipes <br />
- Everybody leaves<br />
- You need to get another 40min queue.<br />
<br />
Though i hore that the re-queue is on top of the line and not on the bottom.<br />

It doesnt scale well enough. Rofl. I am wearing 372 mostly, and everyone and their dog in my raid can roflstomp my aoe unless i burn berserk, and then i might compete. (while it lasts). You can't be serious, dud. Swipe is so bad that unless you have like 7-10 mobs around it'd be better to single target FF or apply tab-rake. While i do agree that +100% is a lot, especially with berserk in mind, it does need a major buff. I have to use my crappy offspec moonkin gear for maloriak heroic because swipe totally fails there, and on halfus heroic even though im doing fine by the end of it as feral, on the most important and difficult phase where you have to burn everything in mass-aoe i'd be lucky to do half of our mage, rogue, hunter and warlock damage, even though i burn berserk there :(<br />
<br />
23k swipe crit is lol-nothing.. Moonkin's mushrooms crit for 40k plus starfall critting for 20k all around, frost DK HB crits for 70k(and 35k on secondary targets), firemages have 2 dots critting each for 20-25k on everything around, etc etc..</div></div><hr />

Ah, OK. Makes sense. I hadn't realized that was a hotfix, thought it was an 'upcoming' 4.1 change. I'm still unsure of Mastery on my resto shaman, it just feels like a tough stat to really &quot;want&quot;. Between the mastery buff and the new totem at least shamans will have some interesting testing to do...<br />

I wonder if this is the same as BoAs are now (limited to the server), or ACTUALLY account bound, meaning you can transfer between servers.<br />
<br />
Would really like to know ...<br />
<br />
No it won't be truly account bound. They recently answered this in a recent Q&amp;A saying that BoA still can't be achieved and won't come up in 4.1. It was either something to do with the coding taking way too long or it being incredibly tricky or both. It is something however they apparently are planning on doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In 4.1, Earth Shield also benefits from Mastery. Maybe the nerf is to balance around this, so that ES ticks do a little less healing than now when the target is near to full health, and a little more when the target has low health. I didn't check any numbers, but all in all, this doesn't neccessarily have to be a nerf.</div></div><hr />

They are indeed a OP'ed in arenas, but not in PvE. They are one of the weakest PvE healers and without any real cooldowns to reduce special attack dmg from bosses, there now even more reasons not to bring them.<br />
This is ofc only a guess, with mastery affecting all heals, might change things, but I doubt it being that strong. What shammies really needs is a raid wide CD to reduce dmg like electric storm from Nefe, breath from Maloriak, shadow infusion + flame AoE from Omnitron and so on.<br />
I know Spirit Link Totem will be the new shammy CD which does this, but 10% with 10yds is simply to weak imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All healers currently have cons and pros, really. We personally are very delighted to have a fulltime shaman in our heroic raid runs which, really, brings excellent raid healing on the fights needed (such as Magmaw) especially when compared to our ex priest, who couldn't really manage the same uptime, not to mention their endless mana pool if played correctly (and depending on the fight, where, again, Magmaw heroic is an excellent example). Though their lack of cooldown is definitely an issue I miss as well when I play my shaman, compared to my druid I feel much more capable to heal a wide variety of (heroic) encounters, where my druid tends to feel lacking in many situations, not being quite as strong in singletarget as other healers, or in AoE, with only (expensive) hots to make up for the poor remaining heals. (note that I'm not saying druids are not viable, druids are very viable and very fun, it is just that resto shaman are just my personal healing class preference despite the (current) lack of cooldown because I feel they bring a much stronger and variated toolkit). <br />
<br />
In all fairness, I DO feel Earth Shield is too strong, I have always said this, that I find it stupid that so many of my heals comes from one relatively passive source (drop Earth Shield, make power aura, refresh after a minute or so - HARD), and how gimped I feel when for whatever reason Earth Shield is not up in comparison (tried healing a heroic dungeon without for the fun, trying to make things a bit more interesting). I'd rather have Earth Shield less powerful, but returned the lost power in different ways. Someone in this topic suggested the mastery, it'd be nice if mastery would become more useful to resto shaman than it currently is indeed. (yes, i also really dislike the current Lifebloom mechanic, which may be another reason I prefer the shaman, since ES is really the same thing, excent it's less of a nuisance at this point).<br />
<br />
My personal opinion. I realize most people would rather just cry at the nerf and ignore the other buffs shaman have gotten. In any event, I find shaman by and far the most fun healing class to play currently and it is part of the reason why I stopped leveling my new priest and din and rerolled it as a main healer over my druid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Endless Mana pool?<br />
I have some real big issues with mana on my shammy, though our full time shammy says it will change once I get the 4 set bonus, which might be true.<br />
Magmaw isn't really a good example, since during the exposed head phase we can get our mana pool filled up quite fast =)<br />
I try to use mana tide as much as possible, but if you have other pointers how to manage my mana it would be much appriciated.<br />
This is just alt alt char though, so i'm not that much into it, but I am enjoying it quite a lot as an alternativ to my main Fury warr.</div></div><hr />

They already took away bloodlust, nerfed tremor totem, purge, cleansing totems, took away cleansing totems&amp;disease and poison cleanse, nerfed cleansing waters, grounding totem, and talk is they will nerf our interupt aswell (that doesnt even lock the school for more then 2 seconds). And we always had, and will even after the patch have the worst and fewest defensive cooldowns in pvp. And now this, which will hit hard to pve healing aswell were we are already bad in many situations when raid is spread out. <br />
<br />
This just because for the first time in arena history you can actually see a some of the skilled resto shamans in the higher brackets. Not to mention the 2 other speccs are hit hard by most of the changes, which were in terrible shape even before them.<br />
<br />
What really needs changing is for resto shamans to scale like the other healers with improved gear, remove the double resilience set bonuses, and make chain heal not unreliable in raids.</div></div><hr />

It will most likely be blue gems, unless they decide to go the deeply risky route similar to the old fishing dailies with the Stormjewels in WotLK. All those will do is cripple the JCs from making much of any money when they do release true epic gems to cut, AND will piss DPS off more, cause they won't get CtA status except under fluke rare occasions, and likely have to pay out the ass for their wanted +Int/Str/Agi gems (since I know 3/4 tanks will just go for the +Mastery ones).</div></div><hr />

The 20% nerf to earth shield is balanced out by the 3% buff to Nature's Blessing, so obviously they felt like resto shammies were doing too much tank healing through just smacking an earthshield on the tank and letting other healers do the rest.

Try killing a shaman with a ranged that is running around a pillar in 2s. It's impossible if they do it correctly. This should fix that.</div></div><hr />

It's pretty easy to see Blizz's intent behind them. The 20% nerf to earth shield is balanced out by the 3% buff to Nature's Blessing, so obviously they felt like resto shammies were doing too much tank healing through just smacking an earthshield on the tank and letting other healers do the rest. The grounding totem nerf...well that's mostly a pvp thing so I can't really comment on how necessary it is.<br />
<br />
You sir have truly no idea what healing as a resto shaman is like ig you thing all we do it &quot;smack on an earth shield and let the other healers do the rest&quot;. The 3% increase will do nothing to cover the amount of healing we lose on our ES, although the Mastery change might even it out. But please dont belittle my class thinking that all we do it throw up ES on the tank and watch TV until the raid is done.</div></div><hr />

I am wearing 372 mostly, and everyone and their dog in my raid can roflstomp my aoe unless i burn berserk, and then i might compete. (while it lasts). You can't be serious, dud. Swipe is so bad that unless you have like 7-10 mobs around it'd be better to single target FF or apply tab-rake. While i do agree that +100% is a lot, especially with berserk in mind, it does need a major buff. I have to use my crappy offspec moonkin gear for maloriak heroic because swipe totally fails there, and on halfus heroic even though im doing fine by the end of it as feral, on the most important and difficult phase where you have to burn everything in mass-aoe i'd be lucky to do half of our mage, rogue, hunter and warlock damage, even though i burn berserk there :(<br />
<br />
23k swipe crit is lol-nothing.. Moonkin's mushrooms crit for 40k plus starfall critting for 20k all around, frost DK HB crits for 70k(and 35k on secondary targets), firemages have 2 dots critting each for 20-25k on everything around, etc etc..<br />
<br />
Yeah sorry i should of been clearer. Swipe is dogcrap for small packs atm but i think 100% is to high. Somewhere between the 2 sounds reasonable. (I personally wanted a 50% buff) but comparing swipe to some of the best aoe in the game and going &quot;this isnot good enough!!&quot; is a bit wtf imo.</div></div><hr />

Enhancement and Elemental were both useless already, and now you've succeeded in destroying Restoration by giving such a heavy nerf to one of their core ablities.<br />
<br />
Welcome to the first omen of WoW's permanent death. In all due time, the remaining classes are next... Time to go play (the at this moment vastly superior) Rift!<br />
<br />
Wrong. Their core ability is wind shear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nobody cares about the other specs anyway.<br />
<br />
WTF?! Why not nerf other interrupts then, like counterspell for example? Besides, wind shear is one of few interrupts that doesn't even have spell lock :P</div></div><hr />
