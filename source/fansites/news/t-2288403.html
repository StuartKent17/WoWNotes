I was thinking the same thing. We are stuck with spells animation from wotlk, mages just got a recent rework on them on MoP.</div></div><hr />

Yep! We're working on updated Warlock effects as well, they just won't be ready for 7.3.</div></div><hr />

It's hard enough to get people to stand in it and with t20 four piece it's so much of our healing. The rest of the spells look pretty awesome though. I wonder what they'll do with the glyph of deluge for chain heal.</div></div><hr />

Plus Balance isn't getting anything. They got some slight graphical changes but no actual casting animations. Seems weird to do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they have been designed and worked so they don't create any more lag or 'graphical noise' than current animations and effects do, so quit whining like a spoiled brat, furthermore you can't 'turn off' these animations, they are baseline for all classes involved so get used to it, some people are just never happy case in point: you.</div></div><hr />

Ummmm so did you?? They rebuilt your specs in MoP and gave you green fire. Your time will come. I swear Warlocks are the whiniest group of players ever.</div></div><hr />

Patch 7.3 - Class Changes<br />
Patch 7.3 adds new spell animations and combat graphics for many ranged classes!<br />

I was wondering why Chain Lightning was back to looking old. Looks like they also reverted the updated Lightning Bolt? Freaking whiny people.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they'll be able to tweak both some more and get them into 7.3.5.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I was thinking these look the same, and not what they showed last time.</div></div><hr />

The reasons why its not good is too hard for you to grasp. Just dont try next time.</div></div><hr />

GIVE ME BACK MY PURPLE CLASS FANTASY, BLIZZ!Blue? Have you been on the ptr? Shadowform is purple, not blue. It looks terrible though. The version a couple patches ago looked infinitely better.<br />
<br />
Or do you mean Voidform? That doesn't look awful, though I do prefer the live version better. As far as Shadowform...they had it amazing, but sadly ruined it. <br />
<br />
Here's what Shadowform looks like on the ptr:<br />
<br />

<br />
There's nothing shadowy about it. You're not translucent at all. It's just...fucking stupid.</div></div><hr />

Priest Light spells look dope but I still have no idea how it will render on a goblin/gnome character (or even a male Tauren). Showing it on a Pandaren is lazy.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heavens Night</div><div class="date">2017-08-29, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great more &quot;new animations&quot; with fucking horde garbage ONLY. Honestly, horde horde fucking horde. YAWN. I don't give a fuck about how a goblin looks or any other horde race. How about this fucking site shows some solidarity and we actually see some ALLIANCE races using the new animations. <br />
<br />
Yea I'm fed up.</div></div><hr />
