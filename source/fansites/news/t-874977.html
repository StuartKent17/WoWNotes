Blizzard wants frost mages to be the best spec ever obviously. Thats why they nerf the classes that arent very good and buff mages more, its to make sure that other classes can never kill a frost mage under any circumstance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slowshi</div><div class="date">2011-03-25, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Frost buff was mainly for PvE. For those of you who don't know, Icelance didn't get a direct buff only the damage from FoF got buffed. With that being said, the only way to effectively gain stacks of FoF without using a spell that has a CD on it, is to sit and Frostbolt. Currently this is rarely done in PvP for obvious reasons. At the same time FoF has about a 30% uptime in any given boss encounter. Stop QQing.<br />
<br />
If it's true that Arcane Blast got reworked from the original 13% damage buff, it should be interesting to see how the damage sims out.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's just on my battlegroup, but 2 of the top 3 3v3 teams on Stormstrike have Frost Mages.<br />
<br />
Apparently not, second team on Shadowburn has one, also on Vindication. N°1 team on Vengeance has one. Yeah, Subtelty rouges are much more prevalent, but don't tell me that Frost mages are not a top arena spec. You know which class isn't a top arena spec, Ele or Enh shaman, only restoration is viable at high ratings.</div></div><hr />

I still don't understand how they think that's a huge deal, since every CC in the game has had PVP specific effects since BC came out basically. It's not like it's the first ability ever to have a PVP and PVE effect, they just never properly listed anything in the tooltips. I guess they feel that if they don't properly list it in the tooltips, it doesn't make it true.<br />

Do you even play at high ratings? Mages aren't all that strong... they're really strong at low ratings because lesser skilled players don't know how to manage one. Once you learn how to fight Mages, you will find them a LOT easier to manage than when you were low skilled.</div></div><hr />

Are you complaining about Rogues running around spamming Premed in stealth to get a paltry 2 point version of it? I thought Shadow Sight existed in Arena. Travel Form CD would make Druids the least mobile healers in PvP, and Paladins are not, I repeat, ARE NOT a HoT class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No! Mages don't get another buff. The buff you think you seeing is what they talk about 1 few days ago and only now will be apply to ptr.<br />
Btw ppl should talk about one class when they know it. Icelance did not get buff was a proc that get the 10% buff and not 35% like many ppl say.<br />
Also if someone check the actualy damage mage hardcast you see that 10% buff is a good thing to frostbolt and will not change pvp at all.<br />
<br />
Anyway anyone with brains know that frost mage agains one dispeller have less control and become weaker then an Arcane mage. Why? Because defenses = 0 and burst = &quot;healer dps burst&quot;. That why many ppl say that frost mage at 2400+ is the easy to kill.<br />
<br />
Btw maybe when blizzard say mages are now balance in Q&amp;A they allready have this change in mind? Because they plan changes way before they apply it or announce.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1st: Yes every 30s and yes there is shadow sight in arenas. but what about duels or 2s arenas with another dps like a mage? kill the rogue its extra hard and when i said extra hard i dont mean balanced but hard i just mean out of the line. the mage can kite both u and your healer.<br />
i would say put it on a cd after if finishes or something like 1min cd. but anyways this is just me, my opinion you dont need to troll me with caps, bro.<br />
<br />
2nd: least mobile healers? i heard other healers mobility are on cd. but resto shaman. example? holy radiance on 30s cd.<br />
<br />
3rd: Back in wotlk they used to have a hot on flash of light. does that make them a hot class? No. Its only to help them when eating full cc chain. Since cc its more powerful than burst this season i would recommend to give them any kind of hot. not too big, but to help them in some situations w/o crossing the op line.<br />
<br />
i understand that u are such a nub and a troll, i dont even care but if u are going to troll about other ppl opinions think before u troll with caps, bro.<br />

They are nerfing the cc's and giving the mage snares more diminishing returns for pvp, but as far as damage is concerned.... they are probably the weakest full dps class there is. In pve... there is no I win button for mages. These buffs are going into the game because it was needed, and its not like mages are going to be over powered with these either, so, there is nothing to complain about.</div></div><hr />

I still don't understand how they think that's a huge deal, since every CC in the game has had PVP specific effects since BC came out basically. It's not like it's the first ability ever to have a PVP and PVE effect, they just never properly listed anything in the tooltips. I guess they feel that if they don't properly list it in the tooltips, it doesn't make it true.<br />

Go play RIFT, once your favorite spec becomes outdated, you just respec and do the new best thing for your class. &quot;My Warrior is getting nerfed to the ground? I'll just respec Death Knight or Ret Pally.&quot; Essentially is how their respec'ing works. If only...<br />
<br />
Except Rift has even worse class balance, 3 of the 4 classes have a ridiculously OP DPs spec (from 7 souls) and every single one of them was nerfed 1.1.<br />
<br />
Clerics don't DPS, despite having 4 dps specs they are really shitty... can't even out dps a mage which is underpowered at the moment.<br />
<br />
Rift is more linear than World of Warcraft when it comes to classes... they only nerf not buff.<br />
<br />
Talk about terrible PvP balance too.<br />

The previous implementation definitely was retroactive, this new one, not so sure, depends on how they code it. If they pull the data from Different foods eaten (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/1775/different-foods-eaten/)/Different beverages consumed (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/1774/different-beverages-consumed/), then yes, it will be retroactive.

<br />
My statement stands. Somewhat stronger now that you really are just fishing for anything. [s]And, as nitpicky not-that-stupid I am, I feel I should say something. Content patches affects classes, like every single mmo in the past...forever, actually. Right out of text based mmos that used to charge you for the hour. Couldn't be a bigger miscalculation if you tried. Which it seems you have, if only to justify not sounding like idjit.[s] not the point.<br />
<br />
On one hand you have a game that's budding that's only been out for 30 days at most(including the pre-release time which started on the 25th, 22 days including only time past the official day, which was the fourth), and on the other hand you have an aging game that's been out for 6 years. No matter what game, you're going to go with the one which causes you to bitch more at the other.<br />

Basically what blizzard did is, they were buffing us for the colossus smash nerf(I also thought it was to help us be better sustained dps then burst.

Complaining about things not working on the TEST realm are we? XD<br />
<br />
<br />
No buffs ? we've lost 20% damage on starsurge, hunter lost damage from aimed shot but got in exchange a buff to aspect of the hawk. Where the hell is our buff?<br />
We also need to be able to cast in pvp. Our dots do loldamageinstantdispelled, all we get back is 1 sec more on cyclone?<br />
How predictable blizzard...<br />
<br />
Miss the part where we get 0.05 sec off wrath and starfire cast times? It should make up for it (haven't run the sims yet so don't know exactly), as well as being a pvp buff in part (lower cast time means faster eclipses and less chance of being interrupted). Besides, the 1 sec on cyclone coming back is HUGE buff, it means druid / rogue will still rule because of cyclone into sap.</div></div><hr />

Totally agree. My main is warlock for a couple of years; Its disastrous in PVP since Cataclysm released, and I cant see game developers even thinking / planning something about it. This game is not fun anymore. Its not that you can kill/ can't kill other classes 50/50- its just a fail. Every melee inv PVP just lolkill locks. Poor Moonkins can go heal or feral at least. And what we get in this post? A little more nerf. &quot;Lets increase soulswap CD&quot;. GO and buff mages and call it Magecraft, and play it yourself, Blizzards.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard knows what their doing. Sorta. They nerfed starsurge because that was our only useful pvp ability and buffed our other abilites to make pvp fun for us. The only thing I still think we need is for travel form to break roots for us. Its annoying to shift into moonkin before travel form to kite them. <br />

Woohoo Wrath and Starfire cast time reduced joy! Cyclone is already 6 seconds on live tho so derp. Now I hope they fix Death runes for frost dk's and don't scare me more with this increased blood strike dmg crap.<br />
<br />
They already did?<br />
<br />
Blood of the North (passive) now permanently converts both Blood Runes into Death Runes. There is no longer any proc interaction with Blood Strike required to activate Death Runes.<br />
<br />
?? Unless you consider that not a fix over having to use Gay Strike atm.</div></div><hr />

Druids already have a throughput CD, while Shamans lack this. I do like the change to NS mentioned, so I hope it's extended to Shamans as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since the new items have new names and new item IDs, I doubt they'd update the old ones, which would just remain the same. Just new drops, looted after 4.1, will be epic.</div></div><hr />

They only seem OP to low rated people, they dont do as well in high rating. That said i dont think ice lance was the right thing to buff, frostbolt buffs is the right direction<br />
<br />
You obviously don't play at high rating either looking at the statistics on arena junkies there are plenty of teams in every bracket in the top 50 that have a frost mage so I'd say mages are fine. Hunters on the other hand their are hardly any at high rating please check your facts before posting.<br />

The Frost buff was mainly for PvE. For those of you who don't know, Icelance didn't get a direct buff only the damage from FoF got buffed. With that being said, the only way to effectively gain stacks of FoF without using a spell that has a CD on it, is to sit and Frostbolt. Currently this is rarely done in PvP for obvious reasons. At the same time FoF has about a 30% uptime in any given boss encounter. Stop QQing.<br />
<br />
If it's true that Arcane Blast got reworked from the original 13% damage buff, it should be interesting to see how the damage sims out.<br />
<br />
Rotf what a joke you and everyone else here knows no one plays frost in pve so cut the shit it's a pvp spec always has been always will be the ice barrier buff is clearly pvp so cut your bullshit. People have a right to complain about a class that's constantly buffed and if your gonna start quoting me about the nerfs to ring of frost don't cause double and triple frost were lame as shit in arena.</div></div><hr />

* Ferocious Bite now scales from 32.7% of AP with 3 combo points, up from 23.27%. (Tooltip fix)<br />
* Savage Defense now only procs from non-periodic critical strikes.<br />
* Stampede now also causes Ravage to not have a positioning requirement.<br />
<br />
I'm prety sure all of these are tooltip only fixes. Stampede already removes the positioning requirement on its free ravage on the live realms. I'd have to log on and confirm but I was under the impression that SD was non periodic crits only since the precata patch.</div></div><hr />

Warrior in pve is going to be the same as now, they just REVERTED the buffs they gave warriors because of Collosus smash nerf which Blizzard fixed by making it work differently against non players.<br />
<br />
Warriors in PvP are sligtly nerfed now that Collosus smash only takes away 50% armor instead of 100% against players. Soooo, what this means is that even though it looks like warriors are getting nerfed to oblivion, the only nerf is actually on Collosus Smash. <br />

Be it one multiboxer or just 3-4 individual players, you're effed either way. At least in BGs, the 10 characters that the multiboxer controls have a lot less efficiency than 10 individual players.</div></div><hr />

Well yes, but people are complaining about the so called &quot;nerfs&quot; in this thread. So that was what I was refering to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends. If you have 5 spells cast on one target with some players supporting the mutiboxer. Multiboxing comes out the winner.</div></div><hr />

But even in fights, there's gonna be a lot of &quot;damage over death&quot;, and once you separate the multiboxer's characters by slowing/CCing or even killing them, the additional characters start to become useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The same could be said for removing additional character without multiboxing. The one advantage a multiboxer has over anyone else is the coronation of multiple abilities at once without a GCD. <br />
<br />
A good multiboxer will set all characters to use same abilites<br />
A great multiboxer will have a few heal</div></div><hr />
