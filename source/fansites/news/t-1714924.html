Mythic Blackrock Foundry Progression<br />
Midwinter downed The Iron Maidens today, pushing them to 8/10 bosses down. Paragon, Exorsus, and Method also managed to kill Maidens today. You can keep up with the latest progress on WoWProgress (http://www.wowprogress.com/), our forum thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1707079-Blackrock-Foundry-Mythic-Progression-Thread), and Manaflask (http://manaflask.com/en/articles/4114?ref=mmoc).<br />

<br />
Patch 6.1 PTR Patch Notes - February 13<br />
Garrisons, Followers, and Outposts<br />
<br />
Follower Missions<br />
<br />
Level 90-94 gold and Garrison Resource missions will now continue to appear even if there are no Followers that are level 90-94.<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrison Buildings<br />
<br />
Barn<br />
<br />
Barn traps can now be placed on top of a trap that has already been sprung.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mage Tower / Spirit Lodge<br />
<br />
Characters visiting the Garrison are now able to use Mage Tower / Spirit Lodge portals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Town Hall<br />
<br />
The fireplace in Tier-2 and Tier-3 Alliance Garrison Town Halls can now be used as a cooking fire.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cosmetic Transformations and Toy Effects<br />
<br />
Improvements have been made to the way that cosmetic transformations are handled. Previously, using another transformation would overwrite or cancel an existing effect. Now, characters can retain multiple cosmetic transformations and the one with the highest priority will be visible. If a higher priority transformation is canceled or expires, the next highest priority transformation will then be visible.<br />
Cosmetic transformation effects that don't have mount animations and previously prevented a character from mounting (or were canceled upon mounting) are no longer canceled or need to be canceled or prevent mounting. Instead, the transform is temporarily suppressed and the character will regain the transformation once they dismount.<br />
Many Druid shapeshift forms now have attachment points on the head and back for cosmetic toy effects such as Blazing Wings or Pepe. Additional shapeshift forms may receive attachment points in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
Accounts with an inactive subscription are now able to log in with the same restrictions that Starter Edition accounts have with the additional perk of being able to join guilds that characters on the account already are a member of.<br />
New Graphics Options<br />
<br />
Particle Density in graphics settings now have 3 detail levels (down from 5). This may affect the number of particles generated by some particle systems.<br />
Ambient Occlusion<br />
<br />
Added new ambient occlusion method NVIDIA HBAO+, available on all DirectX 11 capable video cards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anti-Aliasing<br />
<br />
MSAA is once again supported, with additional controls for fine-tuning under Advanced graphics options.<br />
A new SSAA anti-aliasing option is now available for high-end video cards.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Lighting<br />
<br />
Per-pixel deferred point lights have been added to create more realistic lighting throughout Draenor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Itemization<br />
<br />
All rings, neck, cloak, and trinket items that can be acquired in Nagrand (A level 98+ zone) or later should now be better suited for the character's loot specialization. This means tanks should no longer receive items with no bonus Armor and healers should no longer receive items with no Spirit from sources like item tokens, quests, or Personal loot mode in Dungeons and Raids for those item slots.<br />
<br />

Can you make the gear from Ethereal Soul-Trader available for transmog?<br />
Appreciate the suggestion, we'll definitely give this some consideration. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563088665908633601))<br />
<br />
Why does Ironspike Chew Toy (http://www.wowdb.com/items/119192-ironspike-chew-toy) have 80 less Int than Goren Soul Repository (http://www.wowdb.com/items/119194-goren-soul-repository). Seems very unwarranted.<br />
Trinkets are tuned around their item-level and proc effectiveness, and as a result will have some variance comparatively. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563108207493521409))<br />
<br />
Any chance the Sha'tari defense transmog set will become &quot;Cosmetic&quot; class rather than &quot;plate&quot; class? Only gloves are atm<br />
Being set as &quot;Cosmetic&quot; was a bug in 6.0, and they will be properly labeled Plate in the next patch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563113681358028800))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
9 Elemental Runes from Gruul Normal versus 27 from Gruul Heroic. Is BRF intended to be diff. than HM WRT drop #'s?<br />
There’s always a chance to get extra Runes like how you might get Clusters in Highmaul; same chance all difficulties. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563055611357958144))<br />
<br />
will the 125 stones for the ring quest drop in BRF if we are still on that quest but raiding BRF now?<br />
Abrogator Stones only drop in Highmaul; the next step, Elemental Runes, drop in Blackrock Foundry. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563072033882636290))<br />
<br />
Tier tokens don't have 100% drop rate per X raid members like in previous expansions or is this a bug?<br />
Tokens on group loot work like other loot: smooth scaling with respect to raid size, no breakpoints. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563075985651019779))<br />
<br />
Ko'ragh executes on his shield are super-buggy; Ferocious Bite isn't refreshing Rip at 25% shield health at all.<br />

For several specs, 6+ items on Ka'graz loot table. Chance to get set token on personal loot are more than extremely slim.<br />
Tighter restrictions on spec availability for accessory slots coming in 6.1 should help with this. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/563120022025822208))<br />

Warlords of Draenor - &quot;Nothing to Do&quot;<br />
Bashiok highlighted a nice post by a player on the official forums today.<br />
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/expand.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;bbcode_blizzquote&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;blizzquote_container&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;bbcode_blizzquote_container&quot;/&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;bbcode_postedby&quot;&gt; Originally Posted by &lt;strong&gt;Blizzard&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/361995-chores-feeling-forced-and-nothing-to-do/&quot;&gt;Blue Tracker&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15699784744&quot;&gt;Official Forums&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;expand&quot; style=&quot;float:right;font-weight:bold;color:#fff; margin-top: -25px;&quot;&gt;Show/Hide&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;collapse&quot;&gt;In all my time in WoW, I've never seen the forums as negative as they've been during WoD. While it's true that the forums always are a place for centralized criticism, and so always are more negative in general than what you hear in-game, the negativity has really swelled in this expansion.<br />
<br />
I've been thinking about the issues with this expansion quite a bit, and particularly the comments from people saying they've unsubscribed. Sometimes they post a list of things that have them dissatisfied, sometimes they just make a small post with one reason. With the lists, while many issues might be subjects frequently complained about, there's usually one item in the list that seems to really be the trigger above everything else.<br />
<br />
Based on what I've seen watching the forums and reading these posts, if I had to identify the main issues making people post threads about unsubscribing, it would be having &quot;nothing to do,&quot; and the sense of being forced to spend all your time in garrisons doing garrison chores.<br />
<br />
Now at this point, I've not said anything novel. A lot of the time, when someone does say something like this, it is met with a reply that tries to rebut the person quitting. The replies tend to point out that &quot;there are tons of things to do, more than past expansions even&quot; and &quot;you are not forced to do anything, you can ignore garrison chores.&quot; The replies are not wrong at a literal level, and yet, there's no question that many players feel exactly like the people unsubscribing. Indeed, I'm not sure I like the upvoting and downvoting system for posts, but there's no denying that quitting posts stating those types of reasons for quitting tend to get a lot of upvotes.<br />
<br />
So I think the most valuable thing to do is not to say, &quot;are they right or wrong&quot; but more, &quot;why do they feel this way?&quot;<br />
<br />
What there is &quot;to do&quot; in WoW<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing to do&quot; is what I hear a lot. So, beyond the initial leveling up experience on your first main, let's look at what there is to do. I'm not posting this list as a rebuttal to &quot;nothing to do,&quot; just as a jumping off point for looking at what people actually do vs. what they could do, and where the breakdown is between the two. So, roughly speaking, here is the list in my mind of &quot;things I can do&quot; in WoW. There is some overlap, but I feel like these listed activities carry enough distinction to be separate items on the list:<br />
<br />
<br />
Leveling up alts (leveling is relatively fast in WoD)<br />
Organized Raiding (Normal, Heroic, Mythic)<br />
LFR raiding.<br />
Battlegrounds (unrated)<br />
Rated Battlegrounds<br />
Arenas (2v2, 3v3, 5v5)<br />
Ashran (Nemesis quests adding a big task here with Gladiator's Sanctum)<br />
Highmaul Coliseum FFA deathmatch scenario (Gladiator's Sanctum requried)<br />
Normal / Heroic Dungeons<br />
Challenge Modes (Bronze, Silver, Gold)<br />
Proving Grounds (Tank, Healer, DPS; Bronze, Silver, Gold, Endless)<br />
Brawler's Guild<br />
Reputation grinding for rewards<br />
Apexis Daily<br />
Fishing (hey, some people like it)<br />
Archaeology<br />
Pet Battles (Collecting)<br />
PvP Pet Battles<br />
Primary Professions (Barn makes a big difference here in adding work to do)<br />
Garrison chores (picking up work orders, harvesting herbs / ore)<br />
Follower Missions (potentially highly involved)<br />
Leveling up Bodyguards (some neat rewards for this)<br />
Collecting transmog gear (War Mill / Dwarven Bunker adding more here)<br />
Collecting mounts (including rares in WoD, such as poundfist)<br />
The Toy Collection (new for WoD)<br />
Garrison Invasions<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, as an all-encompassing category, &quot;Achievements.&quot; There are Achievements related to pretty much everything. In some areas, they actually add reasons to do things in different ways than you'd normally do them (many acheivements in the &quot;Quest&quot; category, for example). In some areas, they simply reward you for completing the associated grind (like a Reputation achievement). Some achievements reward you for doing things in a manner maximally calculated to harm your group's chances of success (i.e. nearly every PvP BG achievent). And of course, there are achievements connected to all of the Legacy content you can visit from past expansions of the game.<br />
<br />
What people are actually doing in WoW<br />
<br />
Of course there are people involved in all of those activities. But in terms of what I see on the forums, a lot of people are saying that their typical game session (aside from maybe &quot;raid night&quot;) is comprised of this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Log in<br />
Garrison Chores<br />
Follower Missions<br />
Apexis Daily (Maybe)<br />
Log out<br />
<br />
<br />
So looking at the typical session, a lot of things that could be done aren't being done. Some might just attribute this to the time people have to play, but I don't think that's quite right. Many people with more time to play lose interest in doing anything more during the time that they do the few things in that list.<br />
<br />
My opinion is this: For a lot of players, they preemptively feel like it's not worth doing something if they can't make a decent measure of progress on it in that session, and that they need a certain level of stamina to meet the necessary measure of progress.<br />
<br />
Stamina Calculation<br />
<br />
For instance, if I want to do Ashran to work on my Nemesis quests, I know the queue will probably be an hour or more. To make putting up with that queue worth it, I know my time in Ashran should be at LEAST an hour, and probably more. The moment I log in, I might feel like I have enough stamina to go through that if I queue up immediately. However, 20 minutes later, I might not feel like I have the stamina to start that process.<br />
<br />
That's one example, but two other things play into the feeling of stamina. First, the less engaged you feel during your first block of time in a session, the larger the stamina cost will feel for everything you might do afterwards. If your first 20 minutes felt like a boring slog, it makes you feel less excited about spending another hour in the same game, even if the other things to do are really different. Second, the less structured an activity is, the more players will default to assigning it a larger &quot;stamina cost.&quot;<br />
<br />
Less Structure = Higher Assumed Stamina Cost<br />
<br />
As an example of this, consider reputations. Getting to Exalted with Laughing Skull (Horde) or Sha'tari Defense (Alliance) revolves around killing mobs for reputation points. There are no daily quests or other sources of reputation. Theoretically, a person could just jump in and kill mobs for 15 minutes, make some progress, and walk away with a gain equivalent to what a daily quest could get them for reputations in Mists of Pandaria. And in terms of gameplay, they are probably doing exactly the same thing as a daily quest would usually ask of them (i.e. an NPC saying &quot;go kill 20 mobs for me&quot;).<br />
<br />
But in practice, with no structure, most players just see a potentially very long grind, low gains, and feel like it's not even worth it if they're not doing it for an hour straight. Because the commitment at any point in time is more open-ended, it feels like it has to be a larger commitment. The most efficient way to farm is to join a group, and who wants to join a five-man group and go through the travel time just to stick around for 15 minutes? And if you're in a group, you know you'll feel some pressure to stick around to keep the pace up for rep farming. It's not a question of them being right or wrong, it's just that they default to assigning it a larger stamina cost and needing a larger block of time to make it &quot;worth it,&quot; and then do not consider it worth their own time to engage in it. So only a sliver of players really engage with that content (fortunately, that sliver can find each other pretty easily with group finder to form groups).<br />
<br />
Content outside stamina range = content that &quot;does not exist&quot; to the player<br />
<br />
The stamina calculation goes on in players' minds constantly. And, if an activity is something they find themselves never doing, then they start to feel like that content is not content &quot;meant for them.&quot; So that initial block of time they log on is very important, it sets the tone for what they feel like they can do. Optimally, people would vary up how they spend their initial time. Some days they would log in and immediately proceed to do heroics, or immediately proceed to Arenas, or Rated BG's or Ashran, or immediately proceed to challenge modes or pet battles or many other things. But in practice, the variety is not happening. In practice, they fall into a pattern of doing garrison chores, not feeling the energy or drive to do anything more, logging out, and feeling like there's no content for them.<br />
<br />
Forced to do chores<br />
<br />
As mentioned earlier, one of the immediate retorts to people saying they feel forced to do garrison chores is that they are not, in fact, forced to do garrison chores. While some people describe Garrisons as a prison, other people wave the complaint away by essentially saying, &quot;if it's a prison, it's your self-made prison.&quot; It's silly to get bogged down in a fight over whether something is &quot;forced&quot; on a literal level, because of course it is not. But it's not silly to ask why something feels forced. So the big question is, what makes people feel &quot;forced&quot; to do something in WoW. In my opinion, two things can trigger the feeling of being forced.<br />
<br />
1. The activity improves your gear to the extent that ignoring it means you will be routinely excluded from advancing in higher end content, and you cannot obtain the same upgrade through other reasonable methods.<br />
<br />
2. The activity is time-based, and failing to take advantage of it when it is offered means losing out permanently on some advantage.<br />
<br />
The first category is a criticism that Blizzard is keenly sensitive too, and I would say they made quite an effort to make sure that gear upgrades could be obtained from many varied sources. This doesn't mean that higher end content doesn't slowly narrow down to providing gear solely through high end activities (i.e. mythic upgrades require mythic raiding), but for someone who just hit level cap, they have a numerous methods to obtain gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
The second category is the one I think tends to be more present and more damaging, but also tends to be overlooked. People hate the sense that a reward dangled right in front of them will be lost permanently if they fail to act. The Garrison chores are a perfect example of this. Anytime you fail to act, you give up a reward. The reward is sitting right in front of you, requiring you to do nothing more than interact with it to pick it up (minine nodes, herb garden, work orders). The more accessible a reward is to your initial log-in point, the more you will feel like the &quot;right&quot; way to play is to engage with it. Not doing the task to get the reward makes you feel like you're stupidly giving up a gain, and no one likes to feel as if they're playing the game &quot;wrong.&quot; So you feel compelled mentally to engage that content.<br />
<br />
And if you have alts... oh boy. People with alts might find themselves wrestling with whether it feels like the right thing to do is to get the &quot;rewards&quot; in the Garrison on each new character, despite the drain and lack of fun they feel. It's easy to say they shouldn't feel that way and they don't need those rewards on all their characters, but the question really is about what the game is making them feel like.<br />
<br />
Tying the problems together<br />
<br />
There is a lot to do in WoD. But post after post describes feeling forced to do chores and feeling like there's &quot;nothing to do&quot; in the game. My experience doesn't exactly match that. I myself feel pretty engaged in a variety of content, and I've gotten somewhat used to ignoring my garrison chores when I feel like doing something else. Yet I don't feel like those posts are stating things incorrectly. I think the experience they describe is what an uncomfortably large number of players are feeling.<br />
<br />
Players are logging on, feel compelled to go through their Garrison chores, getting those rewards that are placed right in front of them... Even though that very content is not fun and drains their stamina for engaging in other content. It reduces their stamina for engaging in other activities that absolutely require large blocks of time to give a reasonable hope of success. And for activites that don't absolutely require large blocks of time, so many of those lack structure that the player defaults to assigning them large blocks of time for what it would require to be &quot;worth it&quot; (i.e. very few players want to make a trip for an unstructured rep grind just to grind for 15 minutes).<br />
<br />
This all leads to the ultimate result of:<br />
Log in<br />
Do Garrison chores<br />
Feel unenergized to do more<br />
Log out<br />
&quot;I feel bored, forced to do garrison chores, and like there's nothing to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
And the longer this goes on, the more the player feels the lack of energy BEFORE they do their chores, because their mind is already anticipating it. Whereas before they felt lack of energy to do things after the chores, soon they feel a lack of energy as they are logging in. They start to feel like they are forcing themselves to log in to do something they don't enjoy.<br />
<br />
THOUGHTS FOR IMPROVING THE SITUATION<br />
<br />
Structure:<br />
More structure is needed for other content. In another thread, a blue post recently talked about how dailies are not viewed as inherently good or evil, and also talked about how many players only have a little time to play and others have larger blocks of time, and they want to design for everyone. Now, that's a fine statement. But I'd add something more: Daily Quests should be viewed as potential structure. Indeed, all quests should be viewed as potential structure. One-time quests, weekly quests, and daily quests.<br />
<br />
And I think when people look outside their Garrison, they see a lack of structure, and it makes everything seem more daunting, more of an open-ended commitment, and overall less attractive. Part of the missing structure is narrative. That is not to say that every zone is not full of story. There is story everywhere. But at level-cap, it feels haphazard and unorganized.<br />
<br />
The Garrison Campaign gives you the quest chain in each assault area that kind of ties the story together. But the Campaign quest is automatically offered from week to week, there is no effort to &quot;earn&quot; the quest. On the other hand, the dailies for Apexis feel unrewarding, and do not feel like they play into a sense of building towards anything. Meanwhile, reputations for factions intimately involved in these areas are completely unrelated.<br />
<br />
Shattrath is an example of this. Grinding exalted for Sha'tari Defense does not carry any story, or any requirement, other than killing a ton of mobs in an unstructured fashion. Doing the daily quest for Apexis crystals does not play any role in whether you get the Garrison Campaign quest that finally sends you to the city to deal with Socrethar, the big villain leading the Sargerei forces. This narrative arc could have been a very fun experience at level-cap, and instead it feels very underwhelming.<br />
<br />
My advice on the structuring process would be this: First come up with a narrative for the story of an area, then structure that narrative to have players work towards the narrative's climax, then make use of blocks of time with frequent, natural stopping points. A very good example of this would be what was done in Patch 5.1 with Lion's Landing and Domination Point. You did dailies that awarded reputation, and hitting certain reputation numbers (not just &quot;honored&quot; or &quot;revered&quot;, but actual a series of reputation points within those bars) opened up quests that moved a larger narrative forward, until you finally hit a narrative climax. I don't expect every narrative to be as good as that one was, nor do I ask that every structure be identical, but I do think that is probably the current gold standard when it comes to structuring &quot;casual&quot; world content, and content design should always try to match the sense of narrative build-up paired with frequent stopping points shown there.<br />
<br />
Garrison Chores:<br />
A solution here is difficult. But I think the &quot;chore&quot; aspect of Garrisons needs a serious appraisal, because it seems like a festering wound on the forums. They can't be eliminated entirely, and I don't think people necessarily would want it eliminated entirely. There is some aspect to the chores that can feel fun, and people don't like having a reward yanked away from them. So here would be my suggestions:<br />
<br />
1. Change the mine and the garden.<br />
<br />
Aside from the highly negative impact they had on miners and herbalists (which is only tangential to what I'm addressing), I think players view these chores with a growing annoyance while feeling like they &quot;should&quot; farm these. And I think it gets worse for people with alts.<br />
<br />
The change I would enact would be to remove spawns for anyone who is not of the appropriate profession (miner / herbalist). I would also remove work orders from the mine and garden for people not of those professions, as the work orders feel incredibly redundant. This does not mean those buildings would lack purpose. I would change the benefit of those buildings to simply be that as you upgrade them, they slightly increase the rate at which the Garrison cache fills. This makes sense narratively too - the workers are creating resources for your Garrison out of the raw materials. If you assign a worker to the building, I would probably make it so you obtain one cart per day from them of ore from the mine and an herb of a particular variety from the garden (this way, for instance, engineers could still get ore for their gears from the mine, and tailors could still get their gorgrond flytrap needed for hexweave daily).<br />
<br />
Additionally, I would make it so that workers assigned to a building do not have to come from your Active Follower list, they could come from your inactive ones. It makes more sense anyway that inactive followers are the ones sticking around in the Garrison not going on missions, so why shouldn't they work in a building?<br />
<br />
2. Work Orders need reduced frequency.<br />
<br />
I think the pick-up and put in of new orders is too frequent, and drives a sense from people that they should &quot;check in&quot; with their Garrison, further distracting from non-Garrison content. Changing the system now may not feel very viable, but if there's a way, I'd look into finding a method whereby players had longer periods between feeling the &quot;need&quot; to check in. I know I personally will sometimes go days without picking up my orders, then I receive a bunch from the next batch I pick up, and for me that's more fun than if I had been picking it up more frequently and putting in new orders (despite this meaning that I ultimately obtain a bit less over time).<br />
<br />
I would look into finding a method to reward players for waiting longer between pickups. Perhaps it could be tied to whether you have a Follower assigned to the building (maybe he adds a passive bonus the longer he has to &quot;polish&quot; finished product or something). It seems counter-intuitive to reward people for being LESS diligent in checking work orders, but I think it's exactly what the system could use.<br />
<br />
3. Follower Missions need longer options.<br />
<br />
When I first heard of the follower system at Blizzcon, I remember talk of there being missions that might take &quot;a week&quot; while others would take a day and others mere hours. Currently, nothing takes longer than a day. I think it's time you look into creating Follower Missions oriented around being days long or even a week long. I think you should consider offering multiple of these missions at the same time AND consider requiring more than just 3 followers.<br />
<br />
In other words, Follower Missions could use missions where people have the option to treat followers as a WEEKLY activity rather than a DAILY or semi-hourly activity. It might not mean sending all your followers on weekly quests, but the more you send on long-term quests, the less followers you have to manage the other days of the week.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
I know this post is probably too long. With a post this long, I realize I might not even get one reply because it simply turns people off from reading the whole thing. Still, sometimes I like to write to order my thoughts on a topic, which can make it feel easier to engage such topics in other posts with shorter comments.<br />
<br />
I hope someone finds this post to have been worthwhile to read. Thanks if you did. <br />
Thanks for putting that together Torvald. I think it's insightful, and presents some very cogent theories about what the deeper cause for people's feedback could be. I feel smarter for having read it, and so thank you.	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />

- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
Also the Post from the US forums about &quot;Nothing To Do&quot; is very very good.<br />
<br />
I don't 100% agree with it (it is ofc impossible to 100% agree with a post that long) for example I 100% do NOT want them to remove the herb garden and mine for toons without the profession (I actually think all gathering profs should be available to all toons ala GW2) and while I still think 6.1 is very light on actual playable content.<br />
<br />
They are actually addressing some of the issues he highlights.<br />
<br />
My main wishes for the future are:-<br />
<br />
Make apexis available from more sources (5 mans, even maybe raiding quests, give us the opportunity to repeat the Garrison Weekly's rather than the super grindy Daily Missions, and make apexis gear relevant (more stat choices and way way cheaper I am not 100% sure it needs to be higher iLvl (there are 670 bits in 6.1)<br />
<br />
Give everything some context (I really strongly dislike grinding mobs what are we 2004 all over again?).<br />
<br />
I am interested in how 6.1 pans out as maybe a stepping stone to making Warlords better from a world content PoV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, Blizzard. But after so long time you finally forced me to say these words: Go to hell, Blizzard. You seem to have no clue about your game. I survived destro nerf and switched to demonology although I loved playing destro and hated demonology, but now with the next nerf you just trashed this class. My prepaid is running out in a few days and I don't think I will buy another.</div></div><hr />

That dude is right about garrisons. There is stuff that you feel like you have to do cause it doesn't need much time but has rather little reward. You spend quite some time on them on a daily level cause you at least get some reward. On the other hand you got huge bloated systems like pets, mounts, achievements, reputation, heirlooms, toys, tabards that need lots and lots and lots of time to give you any kind of &quot;success&quot;-feeling if you start from scratch(not to mention that Blizz wants you to pay hundreds of dollars on top of it in some cases). Most players ignore those systems as content cause &quot;why should I start something where I got no chance of completion anyway?&quot;. <br />
It's very cheap content for Blizz to create and as a result they went over the top with it(MoP for example pretty much killed pets).<br />
Players want the feeling that they achieve something...and reachable goals that feel &quot;final&quot; for some time(instead of just another round in the same treadmill). Currently it feels like taking a look into black holes and fighting windmills.</div></div><hr />

Protection<br />
Improved Defensive Stance now increases armor by 10% (up from 5%).<br />

realy blizz...another buff to our already tuned PHYSICAL MITIGATION! how about you remove gladiator TALENT and BUFF SHIELD BARRIER so we are viable in mythic and we don't need 19 people to carry our asses trough it ...first time ever a tank class gets destroyed just for the sake of a pvp talent</div></div><hr />

Can we, for the love of God, put and end to this crap about having &quot;tons to do&quot; and people posting ridiculous activities as a cheap way to justify your time spent? This a goddamn ROLE-PLAYING GAME, I want to play my character, not social mini-games. And all of these irrelevant activities - they are not content. Farming achievements is NOT content. Achievements are a way to &quot;justify&quot; you doing something idiotic to artificially prolong your time in the game. You should do something because it's fun or because it provides a reward, not because it counts towards the next 10 points of nothingness. If they put an achievement &quot;Keep jumping with your character for 8 hours non-stop&quot;, will this be considered as content? Geez.... <br />
<br />
Just going quickly through this guy's activities:<br />
<br />
- Leveling up alts (leveling is relatively fast in WoD) - <br />
Really? To let them rot in another Garrison? To farm the same rares and treasures? To go through the same quests again? Alts should be an ALTERNATIVE form of fun that you choose instead of playing with your main, not THE ONLY other option due to having nothing to do with your main (even if you play casually).<br />
- Organized Raiding (Normal, Heroic, Mythic)<br />
2/3 raids per week. The other 4/5 days, please?<br />
- LFR raiding.<br />
No gear, no thrill, no skill involved, no social interaction, nothing. Just nothing. And even if you do it, takes 1 hour. Sick!<br />
- Battlegrounds (unrated)<br />
Not into WoW PvP. If I want real PvP, I'll play a MobA or an online shooter - games specifically designed with PvP in mind.<br />
- Rated Battlegrounds<br />
Read above<br />
- Arenas (2v2, 3v3, 5v5)<br />
Read above<br />
- Ashran (Nemesis quests adding a big task here with Gladiator's Sanctum)<br />
Read above, and also Ashran is a joke, and the queues are a joke. I won't even mention the fact that I can't sacrifice a building to get the Gladiator Sanctum.<br />
- Highmaul Coliseum FFA deathmatch scenario (Gladiator's Sanctum requried)<br />
Read above.<br />
- Normal / Heroic Dungeons<br />
Obsolete rewards, not fun when you outgear them, no replay value<br />
- Challenge Modes (Bronze, Silver, Gold)<br />
CM =/= hard dungeon, but = RUSH THROUGH IT ALL AND CHEESE THE MECHANICS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN!!!<br />
- Proving Grounds (Tank, Healer, DPS; Bronze, Silver, Gold, Endless)<br />
Did them. Not even counting the fact that they are pointless. Literally pointless.<br />
- Brawler's Guild<br />
Already had max rank in the old season. Doing it now as well, but the queue mechanic for this one is the most idiotic thing they could think of. I don't care about watching the others. I fight for 15 seconds and I wait 5+ min to get in. Every. Single. Time. for 40 or so fights. For 10+ attempts on some of them. Don't test my patience like that, please...<br />
- Reputation grinding for rewards<br />
For an ugly skull helm or a useless follower or a lvl 600 trinket? For real?<br />
- Apexis Daily<br />
Quests are boring as hell, takes 1 month to get enough crystals for a 655 item, and by then you've already been decked in full 670. Good one, Blizz!<br />
- Fishing (hey, some people like it)<br />
Fishing... No comment.<br />
- Archaeology<br />
99/100 vendor items. Some useless BoA stuff. 1-2 toys. Huge.<br />
- Pet Battles (Collecting)<br />
I wanna play my toon in a role-playing game, not pokemon. Thanks.<br />
- PvP Pet Battles<br />
Read above<br />
- Primary Professions (Barn makes a big difference here in adding work to do)<br />
Blizz killed professions in WoD. Completely. Big time.<br />
- Garrison chores (picking up work orders, harvesting herbs / ore)<br />
That's what I'm doing 90% of the time and it's becoming ridiculous.<br />
- Follower Missions (potentially highly involved)<br />
Read up + got 25 x 645 epic followers. While playing casually. The hell?<br />
- Leveling up Bodyguards (some neat rewards for this)<br />
Useless. Like, literally. Rather run around naked.<br />
- Collecting transmog gear (War Mill / Dwarven Bunker adding more here)<br />
The one in WM/DB is ugly. As for the rest - I've gathered what I need, doesn't take ages...<br />
- Collecting mounts (including rares in WoD, such as poundfist)<br />
Tricky. Apart from the fact that I don't see a reason to collect something that you don't like just for the sake of a number - collecting rare mounts means parking a toon there and relogging. That's not content, nor is an engaging activity. You either sit there doing nothing for ages, or just log for 3 sec every hour. <br />
- The Toy Collection (new for WoD)<br />
Toys are useless. And Blizz is killing the fun of them even more by constant changes to have 1 hour cooldowns and 1 minute durations. The way to go!<br />
- Garrison Invasions<br />
Did several. Boring, unrewarding, repetitive.</div></div><hr />

You can always switch to uh, while ferals cant switch on owl and fulfill the same role. its as simple as that. <br />
Frost will get buffed probably, but tbh I dont see why a spec that lets you dps brain afk should be superior to a spec like UH which affords at least a bit of understanding your classes mechanics. :D<br />
just sayin.</div></div><hr />

QFT. Most of the points here isn't even content, or engaging content. What's the point in transmog if I'm sitting in garrison anyway? I want action, I want thrill, I want progress, something interesting - building your garrison or farming thousands of mobs for useless rewards (boar recolor, really?) sure aren't that. The change to the way mythic works (20 people) made it so I didn't get into the core team cause of cutting off 5 people. Used to raid 2-3 hours Wednesday to clear heroic, but I gave up on raiding completely - 2-3 hours a week is a joke. For the past month I logged in only to set up work orders and send followers on missions (made ~100k g with that, only leaving garrison once or twice to Ashran AH), but I gave up on this too - It's boring, non-engaging. Absolutely no meaningful content outdoor. I really miss something like dailies on Isle of Quel'Danas, or Argent Tournament, or Firelands, or Landfall. They messed it up completely, I recall people creating threads right after the launch worshipping WoD, and a few wise people saying 'wait till the shiny wears off' - they were right. The gold became the shit. It's sad, cause I don't remember any time I was that bored of WoW.<br />
<br />
And to counter the argument that was not mentioned here - Legacy content. It shouldn't be included into 'what you can do in WoD' cause really, with that thinking they could release one boss and ten quest every expansion and say 'Hey! You've got legacy content to do, you have still more to do than last expansion!'<br />
<br />
I find it funny and ironic how the number of subs does NOT show how the game fares - it was a LOT funnier with -3m subs in MoP than it is now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that current logic make sense. Why Demonbolt exist? Like single target damage. Why Cataclysm exist? Like AoE damage. So it is bad that we use one for single and one for AoE or what? If it will be nerfed, we will just run Cataclysm all the time. So we will use wrong talent in wrong situation, because Blizzard decide, that Warlock should not be good anymore. <br />

If you actually read his entire post you would see he isn't saying there's a lot to do.

I agree with Raego on this. If the whole thing was read it makes a good amount of sense. The part about queuing is spot on as well. Why wait an hour to do something that takes less than the time to wait? Its one reason why I unsubbed for a little while in MOP. I had about 2 hours to play each week night. And couldn't meet a organized raid schedule. So queue up for dps for LFR and be time the queue popped well time was over. <br />
<br />
Anyway. It was a well written post. One of the better ones that I've seen.</div></div><hr />

Can we, for the love of God, put and end to this crap about having &quot;tons to do&quot; and people posting ridiculous activities as a cheap way to justify your time spent? This a goddamn ROLE-PLAYING GAME, I want to play my character, not social mini-games. And all of these irrelevant activities - they are not content. Farming achievements is NOT content. Achievements are a way to &quot;justify&quot; you doing something idiotic to artificially prolong your time in the game. You should do something because it's fun or because it provides a reward, not because it counts towards the next 10 points of nothingness. If they put an achievement &quot;Keep jumping with your character for 8 hours non-stop&quot;, will this be considered as content? Geez.... <br />
<br />

If you read the post of his, he's actually saying the opposite of what you're suggesting he said. He's saying that those things aren't what people mean when they say there's nothing to do. He merely listed all the things people claim there's to do when people say there's nothing to do in the game. Please read his post. You WILL agree with him. Trust me.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you need a new RPG to play. Unfortunately, this is what WoW is now. It's not going to change. This is what makes Blizzard money. When choosing between numbers and opinions, they will 100% always choose the numbers first. Words on forums mean absolutely nothing to Activision, despite what they try to tell you. The only thing that matters is the numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is useless btw because there isn't an easy fix, the point is blizzard putting effort into programming and scripting thing it's the same with flying, is blizzard really unable to balance flying? No they are absolutely able to do so without removing it; is Blizzard going to invest the time and manpower to do so? No.<br />
What this guy say is true and you know what blizzard will do? Put some daily quests in 6.2 and gg.</div></div><hr />

WTB logic please).<br />
<br />
People (me icluded) want new content, he wrote stuff that should be there to do but people dislike doing it - 90% of it is related to old content and he doesnt even realize it, maybe thats the problem. His suggestions regarding garissons are crap, only first part of his thoughts is correct - some structure please. Going out to Draenor doing stuff doesnt give me anything (apart from apexis dailies pushing story somewhere, anywhere really) they should give like 1k rep with some faction. There are tons of ideas how to improve current game and all these dozens of new developers work on is - twitter, selfie camera and new store mount. Ehm? They did better with less people, so whats going on?<br />
- iron horde assaults ashran and blows both &quot;cities&quot; up, refugees run to bladespire/karabor or even better - garissons, why not? Daily quests+storyline progression like sunwell isle, building second part of your garisson - capital city hub expanding towards the sea, crashed battleship is already there, anyone up for a long chain+dailies towards building horde/alliance fleet to assault tanaan jungle, possibly other continents (that are probably scrapped already)? This is just my personal idea and would require few tweaks (trade post and such) but would also solve many problems this expansion has. <br />
<br />
And many other ideas im sure other players have.</div></div><hr />

My point wasn't to attack that person, sorry if it was understood this way. I had read his post and I saw that he was looking at both sides, as well as offering some solutions. My negativism was mostly aimed at Blizzard and at the people on these forums who advocate the current state of things with the claims that &quot;there is tons to do, if you don't like it - GTFO!&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizzard have proven so many times that they are best at collecting the best ideas out of several different games, combining them, adding high amount of polish and adjustments, adding a grain of something new and shipping it as a great game. In this regard, I consider them real magicians, honestly.<br />
<br />
And considering this, I don't understand why they have went down on that slope so badly as of lately... The bodyguard (and in a way - the missions) idea I saw before in SW:TOR, yet I consider it used in a much better way. You can use your follower to even come to an instance with you to fill a spot! What's the use of the current bodyguards in WoW when you don't spend your time outside, and they're useless inside?<br />
<br />
Then they took the dynamic events idea from GW2, introduced Timeless Isle and then expanded it further into WoD zones. What they missed to do is to make that system actually WORTH something. The downscaling/upscaling of your character in GW2 is what does the magic trick, thus making the content always viable. Sure, the lower level zones will continue to give less rewards, but it still adds up and is universal - karma, gold and exp ARE universal currencies. WoW has so much content in terms of zones, quests, BOSSES, etc. If only they would ever introduce dynamic scaling and universal rewards, the world would feel so alive again. Imagine looking for group for any of the tens, hell, HUNDREDS of dungeons and raids. And you will never get bored! Today I'm doing BWD, tomorrow I'm doing Ulduar, on Wed I am going for some TBC 5-man Shadowlabs, Thursday is for AQ20 and AQ40, etc etc. This is such a golden mine, you won't even have to make a new expansion for ages lol.<br />
<br />
Someone earlier said that unfortunately with my gripes, I just need a new MMO. It wasn't meant offensively, and I am disappointed, because it seems true. This is not an issue of WoW. This is an issue of the whole concept of business these days. Minimum resources, maximum profit. Let the Executive staff buy yachts and cruises of the Bahamas, the plebs will play and cash in. Hell, considering Justin Bieber is so popular, if they could mix it and put him in WoW to increase sales, they would do it...<br />
<br />
I am actually really impressed and happy with Blizzard, considering that they can still keep a decent amount of quality when being so rotten on an executive level. That's where all the sh*t comes from. If you are told to pursuit a certain direction, you kinda have no choice. I will just give one example - CD Projekt RED and The Witcher serioes. Man, THIS is how gaming should be done, THIS is how development and distribution policies should be done!</div></div><hr />

If they put an achievement &quot;Keep jumping with your character for 8 hours non-stop&quot;, will this be considered as content? Geez.... <br />
<br />
Just going quickly through this guy's activities:<br />
<br />
- Leveling up alts (leveling is relatively fast in WoD) - <br />
Really? To let them rot in another Garrison? To farm the same rares and treasures? To go through the same quests again? Alts should be an ALTERNATIVE form of fun that you choose instead of playing with your main, not THE ONLY other option due to having nothing to do with your main (even if you play casually).<br />
- Organized Raiding (Normal, Heroic, Mythic)<br />
2/3 raids per week. The other 4/5 days, please?<br />
- LFR raiding.<br />
No gear, no thrill, no skill involved, no social interaction, nothing. Just nothing. And even if you do it, takes 1 hour. Sick!<br />
- Battlegrounds (unrated)<br />
Not into WoW PvP. If I want real PvP, I'll play a MobA or an online shooter - games specifically designed with PvP in mind.<br />
- Rated Battlegrounds<br />
Read above<br />
- Arenas (2v2, 3v3, 5v5)<br />
Read above<br />
- Ashran (Nemesis quests adding a big task here with Gladiator's Sanctum)<br />
Read above, and also Ashran is a joke, and the queues are a joke. I won't even mention the fact that I can't sacrifice a building to get the Gladiator Sanctum.<br />
- Highmaul Coliseum FFA deathmatch scenario (Gladiator's Sanctum requried)<br />
Read above.<br />
- Normal / Heroic Dungeons<br />
Obsolete rewards, not fun when you outgear them, no replay value<br />
- Challenge Modes (Bronze, Silver, Gold)<br />
CM =/= hard dungeon, but = RUSH THROUGH IT ALL AND CHEESE THE MECHANICS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN!!!<br />
- Proving Grounds (Tank, Healer, DPS; Bronze, Silver, Gold, Endless)<br />
Did them. Not even counting the fact that they are pointless. Literally pointless.<br />
- Brawler's Guild<br />
Already had max rank in the old season. Doing it now as well, but the queue mechanic for this one is the most idiotic thing they could think of. I don't care about watching the others. I fight for 15 seconds and I wait 5+ min to get in. Every. Single. Time. for 40 or so fights. For 10+ attempts on some of them. Don't test my patience like that, please...<br />
- Reputation grinding for rewards<br />
For an ugly skull helm or a useless follower or a lvl 600 trinket? For real?<br />
- Apexis Daily<br />
Quests are boring as hell, takes 1 month to get enough crystals for a 655 item, and by then you've already been decked in full 670. Good one, Blizz!<br />
- Fishing (hey, some people like it)<br />
Fishing... No comment.<br />
- Archaeology<br />
99/100 vendor items. Some useless BoA stuff. 1-2 toys. Huge.<br />
- Pet Battles (Collecting)<br />
I wanna play my toon in a role-playing game, not pokemon. Thanks.<br />
- PvP Pet Battles<br />
Read above<br />
- Primary Professions (Barn makes a big difference here in adding work to do)<br />
Blizz killed professions in WoD. Completely. Big time.<br />
- Garrison chores (picking up work orders, harvesting herbs / ore)<br />
That's what I'm doing 90% of the time and it's becoming ridiculous.<br />
- Follower Missions (potentially highly involved)<br />
Read up + got 25 x 645 epic followers. While playing casually. The hell?<br />
- Leveling up Bodyguards (some neat rewards for this)<br />
Useless. Like, literally. Rather run around naked.<br />
- Collecting transmog gear (War Mill / Dwarven Bunker adding more here)<br />
The one in WM/DB is ugly. As for the rest - I've gathered what I need, doesn't take ages...<br />
- Collecting mounts (including rares in WoD, such as poundfist)<br />
Tricky. Apart from the fact that I don't see a reason to collect something that you don't like just for the sake of a number - collecting rare mounts means parking a toon there and relogging. That's not content, nor is an engaging activity. You either sit there doing nothing for ages, or just log for 3 sec every hour. <br />
- The Toy Collection (new for WoD)<br />
Toys are useless. And Blizz is killing the fun of them even more by constant changes to have 1 hour cooldowns and 1 minute durations. The way to go!<br />
- Garrison Invasions<br />
Did several. Boring, unrewarding, repetitive.<br />
<br />
I know 3 year olds that cry less then you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not checking back in with the game until the last patch of the expansion, if that. I'm still not sure if I'll get the next expansion. Everything about what happened with this expansion looked great on the surface, was extremely fun for a month or so, and then it quickly felt obligatory and chore-ish, instead of fun. <br />
<br />
It's a real bummer to cancel a 10 year old account, but the magic is gone. They're still a bit tone-deaf in terms of listening to suggestions about what the playerbase likes, so I don't have high hopes that they'll incorporate a lot of these ideas.</div></div><hr />

Couldn't have said it better myself. I know it's a bit unfair to judge an expansion this early, but so far it very much looks like this WoD is the new Cataclysm. I seriously don't understand why Blizzard did the exact same thing again after that train wreck. Players need end game content other than raiding, ESPECIALLY now that they've made 5-mans completely irrelevant.<br />
<br />
I'm also sad over what they did to professions. Yes, they were incredibly outdated before WoD, but what they've done with them now is seriously the worst possible solution. At this point I would've just preferred if they let them be.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zharikov</div><div class="date">2015-02-14, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't quite feel like quoting the big giant list, but I have to agree with it quite heavily. Unless you're into hardcore pvp or hardcore raiding, there really isn't much left interesting to do, especially after you've played for long enough that there are almost no: toys, pets, mounts, or ect to do. Ashran is awful (I'd rather have TB than that,) the reputation rewards aren't very exciting (wtf? a 615 summon trinket for something that takes longer to get than LFR, raid, profession, or heroic gear?) and require you to simply boringly grind a giant amount of orcs or bird-men usually. Zero quests or lore tied to them. Give me the MoP dailies that had actual long thought out storylines tied to them, please, not half-finished grindfests dropped on my plate. <br />
<br />
Outside of the Gladiator's Sanctum (don't care to do pvp/Ashran enough for that, thanks,) I've /already/ finished up everything the Garrison buildings had to offer on a single character, and all my active followers are max item level. The transmog gear (with the exception of the SW guard one, which is only useful to humans) is just purely orc-centric, there's no point in doing dungeons (there rarely ever is outside of grinding valor, mind you, but that's a consistent issue that blizzard has always had, so no point in complaining there.) Apexis dailies lost their allure pretty fast, and I just gave up on doing them by now. All the fun timeless isle things they added in place of dailies? Surprise, you can actually only do them once, ever, before they offer you nothing, not counting the annoying nagrand ones that just give you items for...another boring rep grind with no lore or anything exciting tied to it. (Yay, another 615 trinket.)<br />
<br />
I really do feel like they decided to ignore everything good about MoP almost and just take all the bad parts of MoP and made an expansion about it. It feels more like a shell of an expansion rather than a true one - a lot of things when looking at it, but from the inside, it's pretty empty and feels unfinished, especially compared to MoP. There are so many things they obviously didn't finish and just left in that way (The Orgrim Doomhammer quest line, for one) that it feels like WoD is either filler or that they've just given up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To you and the guy you repiled to: It's not about the list. To just quote the list is like reading the headline and saying TL/DR. He is saying there is stuff to do - if you want -, but the whole concept of the Addon has a bigger problem. It is pushing people into a grind they think is rewarding. It's stuff repeating itself and because of that burning people out - so they don't do or try other things. <br />
<br />
Hell, I've never had this many alts to max level before this early... so I kind of agree.... imagine doing the Garrison stuff on 7 max level alts. I'm a little bit OCD, so I have to at least check in (and try to forget the mine and the garden). 1 hour gone and nothing gameplay wise has been done. I get stuff from the Garrison with much less effort, than to go into a raid or do an instance. I could gear up alts in H-Instance stuff when they hit max level. <br />
The Leveling was great! Loved it! The Garrison was fun at the start. But if I want to micro-manage stuff into the abyss, I don't need an MMO, I'll go and play Rome 2 (or better the good old TW games) or Hearts of Iron 2 some more.<br />
<br />
That said, it's early in the expansion and let's see what happens. I'm just angry that they didn't take the beta testers opinion serious. They complained about exactly this problem and nothing has been done. The devs seemed to be to much in love with their concept and thought the players had to adjust. No Plan B. The follower &quot;missions&quot; are a joke....just a timer. Why not do it like some other guy wrote and make it the new Scenario.

Miss Instances that matterd (Points), miss Scenarios (short...and Points)...even miss Mop LFR (a minimum of &quot;I give a shit&quot; was needed) and the daily quest rep grind (well I never complained about that in MoP). <br />

I paid for *new* content - and it's not there. <br />
<br />
If you raid, you're gold. Grats. Seriously, no jealousy here, if you're raiding, you're having a good time. I'm not - I decided to not raid this expansion, and I shouldn't be put on the bench game-wise for that decision, especially as it hasn't been a problem since vanilla. <br />
<br />
If you PvP arenas and ranked battles, you're gold. Again, grats. Not my cup of tea, and Ashran - if you can get in - is just dumb. BGs are a waste of time because of the bots and honor buddy players. <br />
<br />
But, it's probably not going to change. I guarantee they have the rest of the expansion mapped out, much of it's being worked on, and the stuff most people want back would require too much of the game being scrapped and redone, like professions, dailies hubs, dungeons, etc. They'd have to gut Garrisons, and they're not doing that. I only see more of the same, until the end of the expansion. They're all in with the current vision, and changing course at this point would add a year to the expansion, and would not show up in game for 6 months or more, if at all. Ashran will probably be tweaked and nerfed into a shell of what it is now, like AV was. Other than that - this is what you're getting. Another raid, probably split like this current one, MAYBE a dungeon and a day's worth of quests in Tanaan, and some BS last minute garrison things like the boss summoning. Another round of drop grinding for the legendary ring, the garrison campaign will creep slowly forward once a week, and some more quality of life changes and things they didn't get to. That's it. That's what $50 and $15 a month will get you, until 7.0.<br />
<br />
I'm glad I unsubbed weeks ago, I don't care much anymore, and I don't feel any real loss without WOW to play. It's up to Blizzard to bring me and many others back - or not. <br />
<br />
I'm just interested in how they're going to pull this story off, and end it. I guess I won't get more until 6.2, in a couple months. If I still care.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard shows no restraint. They are going to need to stat squish again by the time 7.0 drops. Their lack of restraint when it comes to gear power; mythic brf gear has nearly twice the dps/spell power of heroic 5 man gear and this is the first raid set! This same lack of restraint is why they cannot achieve class balance. It is like the people who create loot don't work with the people who do class abilities. We know that is not true but damn these guys are like eight year old kids with their +500 Vorpal Swords of BunnyElf slaying.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Failboat</div><div class="date">2015-02-15, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think I agree with the nothing to do post. I mean no don't get me wrong, I also think there is nothing to do in the game right now outside of raiding or hardcore pvp but his main point is that there is a lack of structure. That doesn't gel with me 100%: he is right that there is a lack of structure but at the same time there just isn't a lot to do anyway. A lot of his list is just padding, look at pet battles, there is one new pet battle daily that is worth repeating each day (the garrison daily). It takes less than 5 minutes to do, that is not even worth putting on the list. Follower missions? Apexis Daily? Professions? Leveling up bodyguards? None of those things are very time consuming and are either time gated (professions) or can be finished in under an hour (like leveling up a body guard) that is a sad excuse for content. <br />
<br />
A better list would be things you can do past the first 2 weeks of the expansion because most of his list wouldn't make it. Just off the top of my head I've been done with bodyguards, arch, pet battles, transmog, toy collection (outside of ultra grindy things that require doing non-Draenor content), Draenor mounts, and heroic dungeons since the first month of the expansion. Other things have fallen off as well but in most cases the only reason I didn't do them earlier was just because I didn't feel like it. For example I just finished my last faction (Arrakoa) a few days ago but it's not like it was time consuming or anything, it took me 3 hours (timed by 3 DMF rep hats) to go from revered to exalted (in addition to a few rep tokens I had from missions). The expansion has been out for months now, 3 hours of rep grinding content is not something you can hang your hat on when you are talking about a list of content in the expansion.</div></div><hr />

And when it's not, it's boring. Apexis dailies solo? Nightmare, draggy. Forced to go into a group for something so trivial and with many flaws (ppl leaving the party before u completed and making your pace slower again, for example, or many traps from the environment not working when in a raid group)? Annoying, structurally problematic. Nothing is relevant in Wod, except Heroic and Mythic raiding.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huldu</div><div class="date">2015-02-15, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't agree. This expansion has the most things a player can &quot;do&quot;. There are a few flaws tho. The first one being the 5-man dungeons, especially the heroic versions. Beside gearing up or being a tank/healer for the bag, what's the point of even running them more than once or twice. None. Without any justice or valor they're totally pointless. I'm not going to even argue about the current raids since some people take it a bit too personal, let me just put it like this: they're bland and boring. I'm not liking the route blizzard has taken with the various &quot;difficulties&quot; it's a laugh really. Basically the same content redone 4 times if you count the lfr. That just ain't working out for me. The lack of dailies was a bit of a surprise in this expansion. Not that I ever did them that often to begin with in earlier expansions. <br />
<br />
I'm just surprised at the complains of some people who clearly are stuck in some nostalgic mindset. To the guy above, you consider the raids &quot;relevant&quot;? Oh please. I could almost say it's worse than ever. You get a piece of gear that will be replaced within 4-6 months. Time well spent. You could take a break now, return in a year and use their catch up mechanics. You basically missed nothing beside a gear grind. The game has to be more than just grinding gear. I'm a bit surprised that people are so easily distracted. It could be that raiding is far too &quot;casual&quot; these days.</div></div><hr />

Crafted gear and instance gear (heroic/non heroic) needs to scale automatically to where it can support the entry iLevel for current raid tiers. This does not mean auto scaling existing gear, it means that if you ran a heroic 5 man on day one it would drop 630, but later it would drop 640, 650, and so on. However gear already in the game would stay at its original drop iLevel. At least then there would be a reason to rerun the 5 man. The difficulty of the 5 mans would not change, there is no reason for that as you still have fresh 100s having to do them</div></div><hr />

It's relevant to become powerful DOING something. All the other forms of getting gear don't require u to actually move your character out of the garrison anymore, raiding does, that's why I think it's the only content with any kind of importance right now.</div></div><hr />
