As we read most everything posted here (and elsewhere) about next week’s content update, we can’t help but be impacted by the subject of transportation portal removal. It’s a subject that’s approaching 5000 replies in one thread alone, and the question raised there, repeatedly, has been, “why?” Here’s the answer to that question.<br />
<br />
From the beginnings of World of Warcraft, game designers have had a number of guiding principles. Sometimes these notions change quickly, and sometimes they evolve slowly, but a few guiding principles have remained more or less the same throughout WoW’s history. One such lodestar has been “don’t overuse portals between locations in the world”. Too many eliminations of the distances between places can diminish a sense of the world having a meaningful size.<br />
<br />
Of course there’s an equal and opposite design consideration—“don’t make it too inconvenient to get from most places to most other places”. Some amount of convenience is vital. Not every visit to a wondrous landscape is your first. We know when it’s your 100th visit, you don’t want the flight over to be the bulk of your time spent. And of course, some players have chosen to play as Warlocks or Mages specifically because those classes offer unique means of transport.<br />
<br />
With new expansions, we’ve made a tradition of removing some of the portals from the previous expansion’s cities. The goal with that is to encourage transportation flow through newer places where players are more likely to interact with other players. We neglected to do that initially following Legion (and we never did that following Mists of Pandaria for various reasons), but we feel that we should have. We’re correcting that now.<br />
<br />
Boralus and Dazar’alor will continue to offer portals to a full range of capital cities, as well as to Silithus. The portals to Cataclysm zones will remain intact, and many other modes of transportation, such as Dalaran Signet Rings, Karazhan’s ring, the Timeless Isle trinket, Coordination Cloaks, and boats and zeppelins between many regions, will all be retained and functional.<br />
<br />
However, we’ve seen how updates to the game can leave the means of accessing different areas feeling increasingly chaotic. For example— today if you go to the Cleft of Shadows in Orgrimmar, you’ll find it dotted with portals in a way that almost looks sporadic. We’re cleaning that up, and we see this as an opportunity to consolidate a lot of travel into a consistent venue with a consistent look and feel, and room for future growth when needed.<br />
<br />
We’ve processed a lot of feedback on this, especially feedback about specific locations that feel like they’re going to become disproportionately inconvenient to reach, and we’ve followed that feedback through to the conclusion that you’re seeing on the PTR. We believe that the numerous remaining means of quick access in the game make most locations quite reachable.<br />
<br />
If there are any specific locations that feel as though they’re about to become unreasonably inaccessible, we’re certainly open to adding additional means of travel in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Upcoming Beast Mastery Hunter Changes - Patch 8.1.5<br />
There’s a significant set of changes to Beast Mastery coming in the content update next week. These were shipped off toward the PTR yesterday, but haven’t appeared there yet:<br />
<br />
<br />
Barbed Shot (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/217200-barbed-shot) damage increased by 125%.<br />
Barbed Shot (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/217200-barbed-shot)’s bleed damage now ignores the target’s armor.<br />
Cobra Shot (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/193455-cobra-shot) damage increased by 25%.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the Heart of Azeroth:<br />
<br />
Feeding Frenzy (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/278529-feeding-frenzy)’s tooltip damage displayed has been lowered commensurate with Barbed Shot now ignoring armor. Its total effective damage remains unchanged.<br />
<br />
<br />
As always, you’ll see these (and everything else) in the final update notes, which we’ll publish just before the update goes live.</div></div><hr />

The problem here is that the majority of modern WoW still won't encourage players to go out in the world. I'll still queue for raids, dungeons, BGs, IEs and Warfronts from my capital city, get summoned to them, clear them out with a group of people I'll never meet again, then Hearthstone back and log out, while occasionally spending 20 minutes in a specific zone for a handful of World Quests. Spending 5 minutes auto-flying to a legacy raid isn't going to solve any of the systemic problems affecting how big the world feels.<br />

This change is effectively trying to stop the Titanic from sinking using a small cup...after it's already sunken to the bottom of the ocean. I'm cynical enough that it seems like they just want to increase participation metrics with a paper-thin gameplay justification.</div></div><hr />

This pretty much.<br />

The whole &quot;But the world will feel bigger&quot; argument only matter if, and I know this is crazy talk, the world actually has something to do in it (for max level). A giant, empty world that we're just flying over is nothing but a boring chore; a chance to afk, tab out and go to the bathroom, get a drink, check a website, etc. It does absolutely nothing for game play.</div></div><hr />

That would make sense if there was a large contingent of people who actually do legacy farming. But when you can make an argument that there's as many people getting cutting edge than there are people who legacy farm, I'm pretty sure that's not the reason for it.</div></div><hr />

Because they come with a lot of old portals being removed.<br />
<br />
Blizzard posts a lot of &quot;explanations&quot; about it, but they're just:<br />
TL;DR: Trying to justify an unwelcome change...<br />
<br />
Instead, why can't you find a middle ground? Old portals didn't make anyone as good as a Mage when going around, new art is really good, why not make it a good change too?<br />
It's really so hard to understand Blizzard sometimes. Why keep shooting your own foot, man?<br />

<br />
lol right. I haven't met a single warlock that likes summoning. Infact it seems like most find it annoying ...<br />
And as for mages blizzard hasn't removed city ports from Boralus so how is this beneficial to mages at all? You can't even tip mages for ports anymore since everything is cross-server so it's not like this change encourages mages to port people more. I mean it's obviously just a way to stretch out play times</div></div><hr />

Relative to the amount of effort it takes to remove the portals (i.e. almost none) it's entirely plausible that increasing the time spent in-game by legacy farmers would be well worth the (lack of) effort for Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

I do agree that the Cleft of Shadows was a mess though. Not opposed to cleaning that up.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biomega</div><div class="date">2019-03-07, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Relative to the amount of effort it takes to remove the portals (i.e. almost none) it's entirely plausible that increasing the time spent in-game by legacy farmers would be well worth the (lack of) effort for Blizzard.<br />
I mean, that's pretty painfully obvious at this point. Just as the loot changes to legacy raid now make it a pain to get certain items (like old tier gear, which is no longer guaranteed drops; 5 weeks and counting with 0 tier chests from Kael'thas, heck I got Ashes of Al'ar and no tier token let alone the right one), or just how the leveling changes that were meant for scaling &quot;coincidentally&quot; also adjusted XP values in ways that vastly increased leveling time (though they did revert some of those).<br />
<br />
Their reasoning is contrived. Me now having to fly more to do Angler dailies or whatever other old content there is doesn't make the world feel &quot;more alive&quot;. It makes me AFK more. In fact, it might even make me NOT do certain content because I think to myself do I really want to invest an extra 10 minutes into this.<br />
<br />
This has no mechanical reason and does little other than increase tedium.</div></div><hr />

Trying to say it makes the world feel bigger. Vote with your wallets unsub, we know right now that activision is paying attention to how players react. If you allow the devs to win it will only cause them to change more things for there own benefit, not the players. Removing portals is just there way of avoiding fixing meaningful things in game. Classes and other bugs for example. Don't let them lie to you.<br />

*chuckles* Agreed that was bad.<br />
It's not like that anymore in newer content.<br />
<br />
In General I like SEs no BS stance when it comes to travel. You can fly from day 1 and there are teleport pylons in every zone.<br />
I certainly spent a lot less time on travel in XIV compared to WoW, where 30% of my gametime was tabbed out travel when doing my daily rounds.<br />
Another + of XIV is that they don't pester you with dumb trash mobs every 5 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. My time is my favorite thing in WoW.<br />
<br />
To continue with my analogy above, I don't mind waiting 5-10 minutes for a table at lunch. I'm not waiting 15-20. I just timed it on the PTR, and it takes about 2 minutes 20 seconds to fly from Uldum to Caverns of Time. It takes two minutes to fly from Paw'don Village to Siege of Orgrimmar portal. It takes about a minute and a half to fly from Blasted Lands to Karazhan. It takes 3 minutes 30 seconds to fly from Ironforge to Old Dalaran Crater to head to do the Valentine's Day dailies.<br />
<br />
This is all on top of the fact that now low level alts cannot get ANY quick portal to Ironforge anymore for Thanksgiving because the devs deviously figured out they could lock the portals away behind a level 110+ quest in Boralus.<br />
<br />
So, yes. Portals are my favorite thing in WoW. That's why my main is a mage, and I have a very hard time enjoying any of my 12 alts which hover in the 110 to 114 range.<br />
<br />
You should focus less on what you enjoy about the game, and start caring more about what is keeping all the other people around you playing the game. Because, if enough of them quit, you won't have a game to enjoy.<br />
<br />

One that sacrifices critters? When was that introduced?<br />
Yes, there are many portals...and up to the last expansion I had them all(I thought at least. Never heard about that critter thing. I only had a medaillon I think for the temple port...no critters involved there). What you ignore is that many of them need quite some time and gold to get. So you can still get everywhere but Blizz is forcing you to spend more time in game to get that mobility. Which on the other hand ruins their argument again...cause it is STILL possible to make the world feel small, it just ain't that easy to achieve anymore. Is that customer friendly?

the flavor is all the same. a portal/hearth to where you need to be. take out the portal to org you like, there are still items that get you to org. take out portals to shrattrah there are still items that get you to shattrath. take out portals to old dal, there are still items that take you to old dal. try again.<br />

At the very least they could be there for us more experienced players because we've been around the world more than once. We appreciate the portals. Now you're removing some of them... It's just so scary that instead of actually working on improving this awful expansion you find ways to ruin it even more? Hat off for that achievement.<br />
<br />
This is like saying that people are tired of demon hunters so we're removing them to make the game a better experience. I'm sure some of you would defend that to the last breath, that's the kind of &quot;community&quot; wow is these days.

Yes. That's exactly what I do all day. I just jump in and out of portals, doing nothing else at all on either side of the portal. Let me rephrase the question for you:<br />
<br />
&quot;Is all you do waste your time with pointless travel all day? The only thing you enjoy about WoW is spending twenty minutes of your day flying from one place to another?&quot; Perhaps you should just buy a flight simulator instead of WoW.<br />

I'm not a vegan. I don't particularly like vegans. However, I can empathize with their annoyance at a restaurant removing the one or two possibly poorly-selling vegan-friendly items from the menu.<br />

Removing portals increases how long it takes to do weekly mount farms since they are spread out across the world yeah if they make it even more painful to do them I can absolutely see people saying screw this I'll go play a game the devs aren't actively trying to make doing stuff more annoying in such as ffxiv</div></div><hr />

True. But you need to work for those. Invest time into questlines and farming that you may not like. So in other words: There still is the cake you like best...you just need to pay twice as much for it.

Wait... You're saying you think people would not stop eating at a place that used to let them craft their own salad, but replaced it with pre-packaged garbage?<br />
<br />
I made an earlier post about being willing to wait in line for 10 to 15 minutes at lunch, but not 20 minutes that gave some BS about my post not showing up until a moderator approves it.<br />
<br />
So, that's a better analogy. These portals are all about time. The time is mostly about older content. When the current content is not enjoyable, we used to have old content to fall back on. Now, Blizzard is progressively making that old content less and less appealing. That's a pretty bold strategy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV_PzRb1pLk) with the state of Blizzard at the moment. Let's see if it pays off for them. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV_PzRb1pLk)</div></div><hr />

IMO as a result there isn't much &quot;world feeling&quot; either, zones feel more like questing decorations. Flying also changed zone design, HW and StB ones feel less detailed, especially Ala Mhigo (second and third) and Dravanian Hinterlands/Azys Lla.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, it won't shock me anymore if we will soon see a vendor mount for 8million gold that has a portal mage on it. Or we see a shop pet that can port you when talking to it. It just would fit to Blizzards behaviour as of late. It will need 6 months to a year tho...the dust has to settle first.

wouldn't be an annoying grind if you grinded it when it was current and got the items to make current content more convenient. sorry you started late in the game. sucks to be you. sorry you are not good enough to sell runs and get an unlimited amount of gold to purchase some of these cheap items from vendors. funny how you find it annoying to grind in an MMO. what is so &quot;fun&quot; about taking a portal? convenient yes, necessary no. you want convenience to grind mounts or pets but don't want to grind to make grinding easier. hilarious.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Sorry you don't want to play this game today. You should have played it a long time ago when it was fun.&quot;<br />

Awesome business plan. You should apply for a job at Blizzard.<br />

<br />
So people care enough to farm for mounts every week but add on a minute to the time it takes to get there and the to much? If ffxiv has the content thoses people wanted why are they farming mounts in the first place and not just playing it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's use CoT. How does me flying over Tanaris benefit anyone, myself included? How does wasting an additional minute, as small as that may be, benefit anyone?<br />
<br />
The world feels small not because of portals, but because almost every piece of endgame content is instanced. And I don't see them changing a core aspect.<br />
<br />
Gets them more active time sadly that's their primary metric at the moment.</div></div><hr />

FFXIV is fun but there is this thing called a sunk cost people have been playing wow for over a decade getting them to swap is hard especially since wow still has better raid design and slightly better combat even if the gcd idiocy still sucks. The biggest issue though is sunk cost it's the same reason HoTS failed despite being imo a better game than league people had spent so much time and money on league.<br />

Also removing portals clusters even more people in a small area part of the reason I used to use my dal hearth constantly is the portal room there had zero lag where it definitely can on high pop realms in bfa content.</div></div><hr />

It's more than a minute. Flight from Uldum to CoT takes two and a half minutes. Flights to other places are also a couple minutes. That adds up, especially for people with very limited time to play.<br />

How many minutes would you really be willing to stand in line on your lunch break? You don't have to reply, but I'm just asking you to really think about it tomorrow. It matters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eggroll</div><div class="date">2019-03-07, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's just one of those changes like the camera distance change. Something that nobody asked for, nobody enjoyed, but they are hellbent on doing. Because reasons. No, what they said above I don't find reasonable.<br />
<br />
Because in the past the world was considerably smaller, there were fewer places to go. In fact. I in my opinion THIS change will make the world smaller, because people will probably abandon places that are not easy to get to. Basically what they are saying is: we are doing this because this is how we always did it. Removing the portal to CoT? Are you freaking kidding me? It has been there since Wrath...<br />
<br />
I find it funny how they refer to &quot;rules&quot; and traditions only when it's convenient for them... . If I'm being cynical I'd say they are doing this for one reason: to create drama. Reminds me of WoD and the flying drama. They knew they had nothing to offer and everything they did offer was shit. So they created negative publicity to keep players talking - because the negative will stick longer with people than<br />
the positive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one quits over just portals, quit being obtuse, ever heard of the phrase &quot;straw that broke the camels back&quot;? All the little shit adds up eventually. While none of it alone would make someone quit, when you take it all together it just becomes too much. Removal of ML, removal of abilities, titanforging, the uselessness of AP, the poor traits from Azerite, the arguably worse M+ design compared to legion, removing portals, etc etc, eventually somethings gotta give.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only aspects wow has better is high end raiding and that's largely because I prefer larger raids if ffxiv had 24 man actual hard raids I would be so damn happy. The combat at this point is pretty damn equal outside of fury warrior and maybe a few others that have some actual speed. The frost dk apm is something like 30 it's actually pathetic and lower than ffxiv classes.</div></div><hr />

And this isn't a case of people quitting JUST because portals are being removed. It's portals being removed on top of a hundred other little things. They've made so many small negative changes in BfA that every time something new gets put up it's going end up being another set of people breaking points, and if it keeps going like this it's just going to snowball. They're not making these changes for the players, they're making them for their metrics and it shows.</div></div><hr />

Back when WoW was super-popular, there wasn't that much to do for easy entertainment. A lot has changed since then. The attention economy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) is over-saturated. At WoW's peak, there weren't things like Fortnite, Apex Legends, Twitch streams, daily YouTube streams, NetflixHuluAmazonEtc. available for people to pass the time. The fight for people's time is vicious today. I think it's hilarious that Blizzard thinks they can make things more tedious to somehow improve their financial performance.</div></div><hr />

So true! 14 friends of mine played the game at BfA launch. Nowadays I am the only one who has an active sub because the ship mount (which cannot float on water). They will check out Classic but they won't come back for this expansion.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately this one portal removal is likely to stay because those people quit BFA and WoW in general and never coming back (although some only returning to wow classic only)<br />
<br />
What we're seeing here is activision purposefully making these dumbass change just to artificially expand gametime. Look there's more minutes being played in total when it's just players spent flying from point a to point b.</div></div><hr />

I'm against the portal change. You probably can't even list off one benefit I'd gain that isn't trivialized by the introduction of flying mounts. I'm all for Classic too. Why? Because we didn't have flying mounts and flightpaths were far more limited.<br />

This isn't true at all. Mini Alar, Alakir mount, Aly mount, Ultrax mount, the orange drake 1% drop off deathwing, hell vortex pinnacle stone core, the zg/za mounts, sha, galleon, nalak, oondasta, horridon, ji kun, huolon, elegon<br />
<br />
Probably some more I'm forgetting these have always been low drop rate mounts there is no guarentee you got them even if you killed them every reset when it was &quot;current content&quot;. They are also spread out all over the damn world removing portals makes it more annoying to farm them.<br />

It's just freaking weird like people actually think wow is a legit hardcore mmo. The current time period and only if you raid top end is by far the most hardcore wow has been since it's inception. The insanity of leveling 3 professions, the island grind, the chalk grind and so on is burning people out at a crazy rate not to mention alt class stacking that was never a thing in vanilla or bc or even wrath outside of yogg 0 since it was literally the only way to kill it. WoW's entire concept was to create an mmo for the masses with an already loved property and they made bank because of it. There are zero death penalties of actual consequence you don't drop gear you don't lose xp this is not the hall mark of hardcore mmo.

Being the casual mmo never ment it was something you can put extremely little time into wow has litteraly never been that other then wod. If you can’t invest time into it wow isn’t for you and has never been for you, less hard core then other mmos doesn’t mean no time investment.<br />

This is yet another example of when game design can't follow democracy. If players got to decide they'd have a menu that'd let them teleport to any zone, any city, and any instance. Because to players, convenience is always more important than anything else. Then they'd scratch their heads and wonder why the game feels like a bunch of loading screens.<br />
<br />
The bigger problem is that they keep letting these things spiral out of control. There shouldn't even be the case that there are so many portals to every single major area that people forget there's a world between A and B.<br />
<br />
<br />
I understand wanting the world to be big, which is why I'm so excited for WoW Classic. The problem here is that the majority of modern WoW still won't encourage players to go out in the world.<br />
And this is the biggest problem if any that results from portal removal. It's not the loss of inconvenience in itself, it's that the game world overall is pointless almost right away after hitting maxlevel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What the game needs is a overhaul of the crafting system that makes old world materials relevant to make end game cosmetic items.<br />
<br />
It's why i unsubbed. Current bfa content was to boring for me and the new world felt small because there was nothing to do.<br />
Old content was a nice filler, easy to access, quick raids, quests, travel time.<br />
If i knew it would take me to much time to travel i would have stopped doing it or unsubbed earlier.<br />
apart from achievements and few drops there is no content that makes the world for me to explore. mount up, fly and autorun then alt-tab is nothing that makes the world big.<br />
<br />
making the world relevant to players makes the world big. removing convenience and not adding content makes the world not worth to explore.<br />
<br />
It's blizzards fault for giving players an handholding approach in previous expansions. Content that is stupid easy to access and requires no effort, hell they even got rid of flightpaths on Argus and gave us teleports. Now they are trying to revert that. The logic and game design is all over the place... no set items, gear is purely RNG and for every spec, however they require addons or websites like askmrrobot. I miss the times where u had tanking, healing, dps stats on gear (not trinkets)</div></div><hr />

If we wanted instant gratification, we wouldn't be running SoO and all the other legacy raids multiple times every week on multiple difficulties while also taking our alts through multiple runs of holiday events, world quests, etc. Of course, my main is a mage, so this just makes playing my alts feel boring as Hell.<br />

People did old content to kill time till there is something new to do or till their friends would pop up to do one m+ for weekly<br />

Did anyone actually expect anything else? Blizzard has been doing this for years. At least it shows they are aware we're unhappy with it. Had they not posted, I might have otherwise assumed they were simply ignorant.<br />
<br />
Bring me back to when virtually the entire community was asking Blizzard to make Bladespire and Karabor the capital cities for Horde and Alliance respectively in Warlords of Draenor, and Blizzard blatantly blew them off because trashran was easier. It's really rare for the WoW community to literally come together on issues like this and speak almost unanimously. Blizzard simply doesn't care.<br />
<br />
The only thing this post shows is that they are aware we don't want portals arbitrarily removed. It doesn't show that they care or would have changed anything regardless of how players feel or how it impacts them. Convenience is starting to seem like an after-thought to them and that's kind of concerning...<br />
<br />
At least some of the portals are back, I guess.  Just have to take what we can get.</div></div><hr />

Who feel entitled to everything. I personally don't care for the change, cause it just gets me out into the world. Now if they had removed Flight paths I'd be upset.<br />
<br />
Also that BM buff. I mean Bm is already beastly but oof. That is gonna be nice.<br />
<br />
Then people wonder why blizzard doesn't want to communicate, I get it that it's a change that people won't like, but at least they are saying why they did it and made a post about it, I personally don't care and it doesn't affect the way I play the game, but as I said, I understand why some people are mad about this and yet they should appreciate that blizzard at least said something about it, I don't mean &quot;great blizzard keep it on we love you!&quot; but a more polite way and constructive criticism about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I do find annoying is this. The Horde Portal Room is by the entrance of Orgrimmar and you can get out of it and mount up within seconds, easily just by using your class' movement ability. The Stormwind Portal Room is still in the mage tower and thus takes substantially longer to get out of and mount up.</div></div><hr />

But it is kind of ridiculous seeing the explanation behind this change. It is understandable that there are no easy to access portals to each cranny and nooks in the current content (Continent or zones), which reinforces the fundamental core value, but not at all necessary to access content that is old, where the only gameplay element there is for collectors to do a farm run. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is just removing options when it is utterly unnecessary. If players indeed liked the experience of flying to places instead of portals, those options were already there.</div></div><hr />

While I agree with your sentiment, I do think Horde were due for some transport convince love after having to live with &quot;the temple of fall damage and everything you need is far away lol&quot; for an entire Xpac.<br />

No one is complaining that there are no portals to the various zones in Boralus or Zandalar. It is the removal of portals for zones that no longer have any relevant outdoor content for players.</div></div><hr />

Outdoor content. If the only reason to travel to a certain area is to access a old dungeon or raid there, then why does it matter that player should be saddled with a tedious flight, where there are no emergent or intended gameplay while doing so. This is akin to putting an extended loading bar (Albeit an animated one) before accessing the content the player sat out to do.</div></div><hr />

convenience for convenience sake is actually fine in my eyes. Getting to places which is a complete ass ache to get to is welcomed.

<br />
Mostly because it's about grinds. Grinds itself are not &quot;enjoyable&quot; - you don't enjoy actually going there and doing the dungeon for the 206th time. It's just the prospect of getting what you want that makes it 'worthwhile'. If the grind gets out of hand - if it takes too long, then at some point it just falls into &quot;it's just not worth it&quot; category.<br />
And not sure what you're talking about 'an extra minute'. Just for fun, can you take a FP from Shattrah to closest to Eye and count how long it takes? I actually don't farm that dungeon for that reason even though it drops Ashes.</div></div><hr />

Not just about portals.<br />

It's all the other things wrong with BFA on top of them continuing to make a pig's ear of the expansion.<br />
<br />
And crap like this &quot;oh we hear you but we're still doing it&quot; especially for something that can be easily reverted is idiotic. It just shows they do not care about being in touch with the playerbase and just give a &quot;yes man&quot; response.</div></div><hr />

Honestly mate if you are stuck looking for another MMORPG I highly recommend ESO and FF14. They just do nearly everything better than WoW imo.<br />

And you'll need to do it every expansion, won't that be fun?<br />
<br />
The world currently does not feel small because of portals. The portals we have now are perfectly fine and have been for years. If they want to clean things up and route everything through SW and Org, fine, but those old portals need to be included somewhere. <br />
<br />
For whatever reason Blizzard continues to live under this delusion that they can close Pandora's box, and every time they try it bites them in the butt. Do I think people will quit just because if this change? Not really. Do I think it may burn some people out faster and cost them in the long run? Absolutely. <br />
<br />
Also people really need to quit with the whole Classic vs live thing. Its 15 years later, the expectations from one version to the next are completely different.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claymore</div><div class="date">2019-03-07, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem in all of this is that Blizzard is being inconsistent, as per usual.<br />
<br />
Just like Flying. Personally? I don't think it should have ever been added to begin with, and I would've completely supported them removing it earlier in the game's lifespan. But they didn't, and considering how dominant flying mounts are, there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.<br />
<br />
But rather than embrace it, they keep taking it away and selling it back to us, forcing us to grind content in a way players knowingly do not like, simply to call it &quot;more content&quot;. Blizzard is removing a shitload of portals, but they're going to be more than happy to bring them back when they deem those locations &quot;relevant&quot; once again.<br />
<br />
And that's the story of WoW's entire development; one short-sighted decision after the other, and a &quot;we don't give a shit&quot; approach to features added and removed with every expansion. Player housing? &quot;Hey, we'll add a half-assed Garrison system to shut them up, and then promptly scrap everything to do with it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to have a legit meeting about consistency. I don't give a shit if they want to remove all of the portals from the entire game, barring Mage portals. But fucking stick to that plan, then. After all, look how excited people are for WoW Classic, and it's a *massive* pain in the ass to get anywhere. So, there *is* a certain appeal to that, and making the game world feel bigger. Again, though, you've got to sort that shit out and stick to your guns, instead of this continues wishy-washy bullshit that's been so pervasive since Mists.<br />
<br />
Also? I've said it before, but I'll say it again: I think WoW needs a proper &quot;reset button&quot;, or Cataclysm-level event to give us a clean slate. Phasing has completely destroyed the game, and this whole &quot;just talk to the Bronze Dragonflight to revisit areas&quot; just isn't a good solution.</div></div><hr />

If it feels like too much effort to get there then less people will bother clearing out old content every week, which means more people will notice the lack of content in BfA.<br />
<br />
They have no reason for this change. WoW isn’t the same game it once was. You’re not enhancing the experience by removing portals at this stage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could have just left them as they were and added new room in the faction capital. Then they could have spent that time they spent defending the wrong decisions addressing other stuff deeply wrong with the game. Stuff such as phasing, an mmo where you could be in the same place as friends, guild members etc etc but not see each other, why we cant have big city raids and events without the servers crashing in an mmo, why some class's are just undesirable or bad (VHD, Guardian Druid, DK's).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed.<br />
<br />
It is exactly because the world is big that I like portals. I get no pleasure out of spending extra time flying over Uldum, Tanaris, or what have you to reach Caverns of Time at all. I won't get any extra satisfaction out of flying from Blasted Lands to Karazhan instead of just appearing at the entrance. I don't get more excited at playing the game for flying to my destinations from the butt of Pandaria instead of starting from the center. All this does is make me take longer to actually reach the activity I want to perform. That doesn't make me more invested in the game. Quite the opposite, it's working against my willingness to actually go out and run that raid or whatever.<br />
<br />
The world does not have anything interesting that I'm not familiar with already happening, there is absolutely no purpose at all for making something take longer just for the sake of it. If there were some random events or some crap like that that could possibly be an incentive for you to take the long route and actually taking some extra time to complete, I would be all for forcing us to fly instead of teleporting. As it stands though, this is just a hindrance and an annoyance, and I will feel less inclined to run old content than I do now.<br />
<br />
The World of Warcraft is a really big place. We are very well aware of that, and that is precisely why we want to keep the portals we have now. Because it is and feels big, not because it feels smaller. They have it backwards.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, they only buffed 2 of BM's buttons, and will likely only result in a single-digit percentage buff to the class' overall DPS. BM is severely under-performing. Look at Warcraftlogs and you'll see just how bad it is.</div></div><hr />

ESO and FFXIV have thier own problems too. No mmo is perfect out there.<br />
<br />
ESO lack the content that WoW have, the game is more close to comparition to SWKotOR since is more focus on single pve that anything else. <br />
And FFXIV while is a exelent game, the bosses fight tent to become bored quick, and the game is more close to a Chiness/Japaness MMO that a Wester Style one like WoW.</div></div><hr />

But he has a point.. The community has become entitled. Whenever blizz does something they think is right, people cry and complain about it. Let's take this situation for example. People are upset about the portals being removed. Right? There has been thousands of people posting backlash on this, when all blizzard wants people to do is see the world they created. Plus it's not hard to just ASK a mage to port you somewhere. That's what mages (Other then the outrageous damage they do) are here to do. I don't really care for the change, since I have all the flight points, and I have a mage. I don't see the big issue here other then people being kinda lazy, and taking the portals we currently have for granted.</div></div><hr />

You say this, but I am betting when the next game comes out (Either wow classic, or WC3 Remastered) You will buy it. It's also not right to say they should go out of business, this is the issue with the community right here.

I mean tbf both of those are actually good games.<br />

As for WC3. I'll just keep playing the older one because if it's anything like SC they will make the older one free to play. Still a fair few custom games being played on it.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they went full retard.. I think they just want people to see the world they worked so hard on. Plus it's not hard to JUST ask a mage to port you places.. I feel like the community is becoming entitled and lazy. It's not hard to just ask for a port.<br />

Not really.<br />
<br />
They removed something, then proceeded to say &quot;we hear you&quot; and then go full on ignorant about it. If they actually heard the community they'd be considering reverting it. But no they seem to have a mantra of &quot;if it ain't broke let's completely fuck it up&quot; these days.<br />

I've played this game for almost 13 years now. I've SEEN the World they've created 27 times now. Before AND after the Cataclysm. I've leveled through every single zone they've put out. I have the Loremaster Achievement. I have the World Explored achievement. I've SEEN the damned world. Their world never changes. There isn't dynamic weather. Dynamic events. Nothing that changes the zones I've seen dozens of times. Making it take longer for players to get places is just adding idiotic tediousness at this point.<br />

This is what I mean. Everyone has taken the Dalaran portals for granted. In Cata they removed all the ports to the other cities. Same with Wrath for Shattrath. You had to realize they weren't gonna be there forever. Just ask a mage. It's not hard.. I know I am coming off as defending this. It's mainly because I don't care about it.

WoW is a themepark, the Devs purposefully abandon the entire existing world each new expansion. This is not a sandbox game. Otherwise you'd give us weapon skills back, and other inconveniences. Travel time to old rides do not make any sense. It's just another inconvenience without substance to back it up.<br />

While I feel that this is alittle rude, I have to agree that it feels like many in the community feel entitled, and kinda lazy. We've taken the portals for granted. It's not hard to just ask a mage or take a flight path somewhere. Or even fly there. We should be lucky they haven't taken flying form Azeroth, Outlands, Northrend, Pandaria and Draenor. But instead the community goes into uproar.. I get what people are saying, but the constant rude and cries over portals being removed. Portals that weren't going to stay forever is kinda silly.</div></div><hr />

Ok, on a more serious, non-sarcastic note: Removing the portals has nothing to do with making us appreciate the world. It's not about making the world feel bigger.

But I do need to point out that if a core class ability needs to be buffed by as much as 125% in the middle of a raid tier, I wonder how BM hunter even passed internal Qual and was deemed raid ready. It is an admission on Blizzard's part that BM was essentially DOA on BOD release. And that's utter BS way to treat every BM brethren who have been struggling through BOD. <br />
<br />
Couple this with how buggy BM is on fights like Jadefire, Jaina with pets despawning or not able to hit walls etc, I wonder if they even were tested internally by Blizzard before BOD released. Very poor form from Blizzard dev.</div></div><hr />

World of Warcraft is huge, getting from one place to another takes literal ages (not as much as going by foot through barrens for example, but it's different). If we'd like to do some weekly stuff like legacy world bosses, maybe some legacy raids like AQ, MC for tmogs/mounts, going back to Legion for fucking pets I'm still missing from emissary chests (because fuck RNG) we're going to take just as much time traveling as doing the actual stuff.

<br />
Does everyone play a mage? Does every mage just drop what they're doing to port someone somewhere? <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but you're being naive. Travel to these old areas SHOULD be convenient. Why? Because we've all been there, done that hundreds if not thousands of times. There is no value in making it take longer to get there. There's no making the world feel bigger in these places. It's like putting up rope barriers in front of a door and claiming that the rope makes you appreciate getting across the otherwise empty space bigger, and that you'll appreciate that empty space more. <br />
<br />
It's pure bullshit. All it does it make it irritating and slower. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's not a big deal&quot; is just another form of rationalization.<br />
&quot;Go get a mage&quot; is just another way of excusing blizzard for doing something nonsensical. <br />
<br />
&quot;It takes a little longer&quot; is EXACTLY what it's meant to do. Or did you forget that we have pay Blizzard each month to play?

Why do you feel like every single Mage in the game is going to be like you? Because, I'm sorry, they aren't.</div></div><hr />

So you would throw away sitting 10 minutes in a 20 min queue to port a random person? You have my deepest respect then. I probably wouldn't even bother asking...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does everyone play a mage? Does every mage just drop what they're doing to port someone somewhere? <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but you're being naive. Travel to these old areas SHOULD be convenient. Why? Because we've all been there, done that hundreds if not thousands of times. There is no value in making it take longer to get there. There's no making the world feel bigger in these places. It's like putting up rope barriers in front of a door and claiming that the rope makes you appreciate getting across the otherwise empty space bigger, and that you'll appreciate that empty space more. <br />
<br />
It's pure bullshit. All it does it make it irritating and slower. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's not a big deal&quot; is just another form of rationalization.<br />
&quot;Go get a mage&quot; is just another way of excusing blizzard for doing something nonsensical. <br />
<br />
&quot;It takes a little longer&quot; is EXACTLY what it's meant to do. Or did you forget that we have pay Blizzard each month to play? How many tiny little &quot;it takes longer&quot; do you think there are in the game? I'll tell you: THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS. Time = money and Acti-Blizz isn't stupid. They know how the boiled frog theory works, but apparently you don't.<br />
<br />
You gotta admit that because of the dalaran portals, mages haven't really had to use their ports because there has been no point. While I do agree with some of the stuff you've said.I stick by what I said. Not being a fanboy/girl or anything. I just feel this isn't a huge deal. Atleast to me. This is all my opinion after all and you are welcomed to disagree with it! ^.^<br />

&quot;Hi, I sit on my ass playing a video game for several hours a week. I am an adult and know that its a complete and utter waste of time to play a video game. A lot of times I'm just on a mount in a capital city hitting my space bar because I think its cool. I like wasting time.&quot;<br />

&quot;What, what?? You remove portals *stats to drool violently* Now I have to spend an extra 300 seconds getting somewhere! This is absurd! I won't stand for it! *more drool*&quot;</div></div><hr />

I agree with the last statement. I feel like Blizz is afraid of their fanbase. I mean they got bullied into balancing the WM buff because of the horde fans yelling. I mean people should of realized they would remove those ports after the expansion they were in. It's happened in Wrath and in Cata.<br />

Why do you think there's no flying in BFA? Why do you think there's no flying across oceans? Because of a lot of reasons, but among those reasons is because they don't want to make the game open to people to travel via flying because of this &quot;illusion&quot; of a large world. It's really not large, at all. Cities aren't cities, they're towns. Countryside is more like someone's front yard. Oceans are more like lakes. They rely on the &quot;illusion&quot; rather than making actuality.</div></div><hr />

... You might not know this but WoW has a VERY diverse community. You thinking both groups are the same people is.. well.. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xath</div><div class="date">2019-03-07, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I feel that this is alittle rude, I have to agree that it feels like many in the community feel entitled, and kinda lazy. We've taken the portals for granted. It's not hard to just ask a mage or take a flight path somewhere. Or even fly there. We should be lucky they haven't taken flying form Azeroth, Outlands, Northrend, Pandaria and Draenor. But instead the community goes into uproar.. I get what people are saying, but the constant rude and cries over portals being removed. Portals that weren't going to stay forever is kinda silly.<br />
<br />
Ahahahahaha you have to be ion the community would completely riot if they tried to take away flight from old areas what little is left anyway. Defending removing convenience to increase time spent not playing the game while afk on a flight path is the most brain dead arguement I have heard yet from a blizz shill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The amount of ridiculous crying over something like this is just sad.<br />
<br />
<br />
If it was up to me we'd have even less of them and more zeps/boats or just fps.<br />

I can't think of a single time someone has actually said this and meant it unless they were talking about Vanilla. And Vanilla is viewed through 12in thick nostalgia goggles, and it was only fun back then because we didn't know any better. <br />
<br />
And even if I'm completely bassackwards wrong on that.....Classic servers are coming for anyone who wants that &quot;inconvenient&quot; gameplay. Leave current conveniences in the live game alone. Nobody wants portals removed except Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Why is it people have such a hard time understanding that those 2 sets of people are almost entirely different? *sigh*</div></div><hr />
