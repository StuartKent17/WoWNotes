Two days ago I talked about the Wrath of the Lich King Mounts (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=13096.0) and mentionned in the post the new motorcycle mount called &quot;The Hog&quot;. I didn't expect it to happen that soon but it looks like the item related to the mount is now unlocked on beta servers! For the moment I'm not really sure if this was caused by a GM testing it or if players can already get it in game but it's definitely here. <br />
<br />
The item is here, the mount isn't something temporary used in a quest or something and it looks like you can actually get an item and learn the spell just like any other mount.<br />
You can also use it in Northrend and Outland.<br />
As of today, it's not restricted to engineers and anyone can use it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, keep in mind that this is a beta version of the game and it could be changed in the future. <br />

Blizzcon tickets lottery restrictions<br />
Anyone who was able to purchase any amount of tickets before they sold out last Tuesday will be ineligible to win additional tickets in the drawing. We do understand that some players may have intended to purchase more tickets for family or friends, however, this drawing is intended to help out as many players as possible who were unable to secure any tickets on Monday or Tuesday due to technical issues with the store.<br />
<br />
The drawing is specifically to give those who tried to get tickets (or had tickets in their carts) but could not purchase them due to technical issues another shot at buying tickets. This drawing is not simply a way of releasing 3,000 more tickets for anyone else that wants to go to BlizzCon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/25/9023605638-lottery.html))<br />

Account password on beta servers<br />
If we refresh the beta accounts from the live ones, you might get the new password instead. Until that time though, which is not to be expected, you should continue using the old password. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/9023686088-password-in-beta.html))<br />

Armor in Wrath of the Lich King<br />
Armor is one of the most important stats a tank can have. We aren't trying to keep bears from getting it.<br />
<br />
The change to itemization was done solely to avoid having so much diversity in the items we could drop. It's lame when you're leveling up to keep seeing quest rewards that are itemized for your spec (which TBH is still a problem we haven't solved for Feral weapons and idols). It's lame when your raid kills a boss and he drops say elemental mail, healing leather, and a spellpower mace, none of which your group can use. Having bears, cats and rogues all desire the same leather drops isn't a panacea -- it helps some problems, but it creates others. Having bears run around with as much armor as a rogue would be a big, big problem.<br />
<br />
Fortunately there are plenty of ways to give bears the armor they need -- through talents (like the crit resistance one) or through Dire Bear form itself for example. Even if another tanking class ends up having slightly more armor than a druid, the differences should be so minor that neither of you is at a significant disadvantage on a boss.<br />
<br />
I am glad someone mentioned the hunter example. I am really hoping you guys have the same reaction when you see the next pass on druid talents. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/8537784293-feral-concerns-in-wotlk.html))<br />

Growl sucks. We'll fix it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/9023666362-growl-is-weak.html))<br />
<br />
Boars and Charge<br />
We actually debated this issue quite a bit. In the end it came down to a call about whether it was more fitting to boars to keep Charge or whether it was more fitting for the boar to be a tanking pet. The tanking pets were all going to get Intervene instead of Charge, since it let them be more useful as an OT, and we didn't think it was worth the cost of making changes or exceptions to that design just to preserve boars Charging.<br />
<br />
In the end, we decided that boars are feared because they are tough. They have leathery skin, a stubborn disposition and had a reputation for fighting on long after their wounds should have killed them. In short, they felt like a tank. We tried to keep the feeling of the old Charge with the bonus component to Gore.<br />
<br />
It was very difficult to come up with a whole new system for pets without losing any aspect of the old system that might be important to players. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/9023656642-boars--charge-the-now-lost-fun-factor.html))<br />
<br />
Kill Command changes<br />
Kill Command was initially created as a reactive ability, something you hit when an event happened (a critical strike). The problem was that the event happened too often, and players just stuck it into a macro. Kill Command basically just became a flat damage increase. Players are right to assume their DPS has jumped because of shots not interrupting the auto-shot timer (it has, our tests show a ~140 DPS increase in some trials), so I think it's fair to say the class' sustained DPS will be okay.

WotLK Cinematic at the Games Convention ?<br />
Yesterday, the following mail from the Blizzard's PR team was posted on Maxconsole.net (http://www.maxconsole.net/?mode=news&amp;newsid=30623)<br />
<br />
Just wanted to let you all know that Blizzard will be unveiling the opening cinematic movie for World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King at the Games Convention in Leipzig. The cinematic will be shown at 1:00 p.m., Thursday 21 August at the Blizzard Entertainment booth (D01 in Hall 5). A Q&amp;A session featuring members of the cinematics team will immediately follow.<br />
<br />
Blizzard’s lineup of activity will also feature hands-on gameplay with StarCraft II and Wrath of the Lich King, Q&amp;A sessions with members from the StarCraft II and Diablo III teams, and more.<br />
<br />
The information was widely posted on other sites, including popular ones like Kotaku (http://kotaku.com/5038293/blizzard-unveiling-lich-king-cinematic-details-at-leipzig) but I wouldn't take it as confirmed until we hear it from Blizzard itself on one of their official site.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids have already taken a hit to our dodge / agility ratio, now they're planning on making us not the highest AC tank too?<br />
<br />
Druids need the extra armor for the mitigation as we lack block and parry. Both Warriors and Paladins reduce a lot of damage with blocking. All tanking classes apart from Druids reduce a chunk with parry. <br />
<br />
If a Druid is sitting at similar armor levels to any of the other tanking classes, with dodge rates even lower than they are now, they're just not going to be viable tanks :(.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard decided that druids will tank by having biggest amount of health... Which of course impacts healers most, druid tank with low avoidance armor and big HP is like a Target Dummy. Will try to find this Blizzard post and paste it.<br />

What's not to like? First, you get two extra ports with trinkets. I'm alliance and gnome engineering, so they are to Toshley's and Gadget(now less useful with CoT rep). You also get good pre-raid bullets, potion injectors, a CC, and even a way to rez others in an emergency. The mote gun nets me double the profits from farming. Engineering has overall a good money making ability, utility, and fun factor(especially with the crafted mounts). What more do you want?</div></div><hr />

There was no mistake that a horde and an Ali version was made. If thats not a indicator that its not a engineering mount I don't know what is.</div></div><hr />

Potion injector was a nice try but its useless atm, the pre-raid bullets aren't economically interesting with the inflated ore (I hate all you jewelcrafters), there is no cc for goblin engineering, jumper cables only become usefull on hunter/rogue/mage, otherwise they're just cute, mote extractor is only worth it if your other profession is gathering and blah blah blah. Perhaps I was wrong in making a gnome lock with tailoring/goblin engie, so far all I use are the googles and the repair bots (and the choppa).<br />

<br />
Let's see...<br />
1. Less armor = more damage per hit<br />
2. Still no parry or block = less mitigation per hit<br />
3. Agility nerf = less dodge = more damage per hit<br />
4. More HP = more healing needing to be done due to larger hits and getting hit more often = healers going OOM healing a druid = no one wanting a druid tank.<br />
<br />
I realize that they are not done with working on ferals, but the way they keep talking about them is making me more concerned that they have absolutely no idea how druid tanks work now, and no idea what to do with them in LK.<br />
Hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised by the next pass on druid talents, but at the moment I'm not going to be holding my breath.</div></div><hr />

WoW is not a medival game.... its based on fantasy and fantasy is way more flexible then Medieval times. If you played any of the rts warcraft games you would understand where their technology comes from. The hog should be Engineering only based on the fact that peopel sacrifice so much to have it capped. The bike is far from stupid so if your not a fan of it get over yourself. <br />

<br />
1 - It seems like you get the key as a quest reward. Perhaps as a rare drop from professional daily (engineering) quest - much like the fishing hat / pets / eye of the sea / 2 ring ( &lt;- hope not that rare) from fishing daily? This would prevent the &quot;everyone will be riding it&quot; that people are qqing about. That is my guess anyway. Though not having &quot;requires engineering level XXX&quot; makes it unusual and if it were from professional daily it seems you could drop engineering after winning it. Maybe it is not engineering specific at all, but i still suspect it is likely to be.<br />
<br />
2 - Can't use in old azeroth or in BGs? :( that is the only place i ever use a land mount. especially with flight form being instant cast and way faster, I could see it sitting in my spell tab but never really getting used (much like my roflcopter tbh).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's see...<br />
1. Less armor = more damage per hit<br />
2. Still no parry or block = less mitigation per hit<br />
3. Agility nerf = less dodge = more damage per hit<br />
4. More HP = more healing needing to be done due to larger hits and getting hit more often = healers going OOM healing a druid = no one wanting a druid tank.<br />
<br />
I realize that they are not done with working on ferals, but the way they keep talking about them is making me more concerned that they have absolutely no idea how druid tanks work now, and no idea what to do with them in LK.<br />
Hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised by the next pass on druid talents, but at the moment I'm not going to be holding my breath.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless Blizzard backpedal on something, this looks to be the way we're going. No healer is going to want to heal a tank whose sole tanking ability is that he just has a ton of health to absorb all those blows for a while. Unless mana is almost useless for healers since they always have it, meaning they can spam heal all day long, I don't see this as a realistic option. <br />
<br />
The comments thus far are that Druids will be a different healing style than Warriors. If, by having to have multiple healers spam heal the Druid because the Druid is taking a lot of that damage rather than mitigating it, no one's really going to bother with Feral tanks unless there's some trick boss that does such an insane amount of un-resistible damage that no one other than a Feral can do the job. So, great, you may have a boss or two tossed in that only Druids can tank because no other tanks can stack the sheer amount of stamina. What, then? Back to cat form?<br />
<br />
Thus, we're left hanging. Waiting to see what, if anything, Blizzard comes up with for mitigation. Damage reduction either via talents or integrated into Dire Bear would be something. So far, all we hear is that we'll have a big health pool. It's not enough. No one wants a sponge tank. No one wants to heal a sponge tank unless they have to.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;druid healing is a blackhole&quot; in TBC is really not true, unless your druids suck at itemization? <br />
Or are you talking about in Beta?<br />
<br />
And if Blizzard does continue down this path, even with down-ranking no longer available, it would still be a problem.<br />
Let's say that Warrior does 65% mitigation with avoidance, parry, block, armor.<br />
And bear gets 35% from dodge and armor.<br />
Warrior has let's say 18K HP<br />
Druid has 30K HP<br />
Boss hits for 12K pre-mitigation, and hits 30 times per minute.<br />
Warrior will take 4.2K hits 126K damage per minute<br />
Druid will take 7.8K hits 234K damage per minute<br />

I know I would rather heal the warrior, given this scenario.</div></div><hr />

basically yes<br />
<br />
<br />
That is so lame! That mount screams engineering and should be made by them. Why is it restricted to Outland and Northrend? Doesn't make any sense at all.<br />
<br />
It is probably just non engineering for testing purposes, they hardly need to test the requirment for 450 engineering. And it will be restricted because i get the feeling that all multi passenger mounts are going to be restricted to outland and northrend. Else maybe it goes faster than 100% that could be another reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This mount will be probably the WotLK Collector's Edition special item or a new TCG loot mount (so, it won't need a specific profession + have Horde and Alliance versions and level 80 req) for a WotLK booster series.<br />
good point. That is a possibility, but it does scream engineering just due to its style and engineers would feel very left out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, maybe the passenger mounts will work only in OL and Northend 'cause blizzard doesn't want all that speed powerleveling for low levels (maybe the aggro range will be the driver one, so you could give a ride for a lvl 1 all the way to northend without aggroing lol).<br />

<br />
<br />
Thats a good thing to factor in, powerlevling, it must be really annoying blizz these days all the bugs people take advantage of.<br />
It will change, i have no doubt of that.<br />
You never know multi passenger mounts may not be allowed in bgs just like fly ing mounts , purely because they provide an unfair advantage, in like wsg it would allow people to stick together much easier, meaning they would be slightly op, not sure whether blizzz would allow that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't use in old azeroth or in BGs? :( that is the only place i ever use a land mount. especially with flight form being instant cast and way faster, I could see it sitting in my spell tab but never really getting used (much like my roflcopter tbh).<br />
<br />
<br />
Its all about style with engineering. And it is most likely going to be a multi passenger mount meaning there will definately be a use for it. I don't see you carrying people on your back in flight form like a gryphon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Its unlikely but maybe it does go faster than your usual land mount, that would mean that you could end up jumping past barriers in the landscape, similar to why blizz didnt allow flying mounts into azeroth due to incomplete landscapes.<br />
And again it is likely a multi passenger mount.</div></div><hr />

Yes, all healers say bears are easier to heal than prots, though in the end they probably take a little more total damage.<br />

It was an example, but I knew some incredibly smart poster would point out such incredibly obvious things as a warrior who is well geared currently having over 18K HP.<br />
Much like it should be obvious to anyone who plays this game that no druid tank currently has only 35% dodge...<br />

i've played on private servers that allow flying mounts in azeroth.

Doesn't make much sense for it to me limited there when its meant to carry two or more people and you'll most likely be flying around in both more then riding around.<br />
<br />
The current theroy I'm running with is that the spell to learn to create this is an engineer reward you can only get from a dungeon or something. I saw a similar quest for Halls of Stone on wowhead a few days ago. http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?quest=12889<br />
<br />
Perhaps the Hog is a reward in Heroic Halls of Stone or Halls of Lighting? Who can say. But there are so many advanced pieces of tech and engineering running around in the Storm Peaks and Titan ruins, I think we can see it in there no doubt. Could even get it from the Goblins based there in K3.</div></div><hr />

Engineering has a mount currently. There are 2 skins for the bike for horde and alience where the existing engineering mount has 1. Blizzard is proud of their siege weapons and the art on the bike matches the theme of siege weapons identically for each prospective faction as you have mentioned.
