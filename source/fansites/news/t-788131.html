Cataclysm Paid Faction and Race Changes<br />
With two new playable races just on the horizon, many players have been asking when they'll be able to convert their existing characters into goblins or worgen. Paid faction and race changes will be available immediately once Cataclysm is released. Realm First achievements for leveling any class to 85 will be available in Cataclysm. However there will be no Realm First achievements associated with leveling characters of a specific race.<br />
<br />
There will be a slight change to the way paid services work for goblins and worgen. Goblin and worgen characters wishing to change race or faction cannot be in Lost Isles or Gilneas; they must be elsewhere to initiate the process. There are no restrictions on race/faction change to goblin or worgen.<br />
<br />

Battle.net Dial-in Authenticator Now Available<br />
The phone authenticator datamined a few weeks ago is going live! <br />
Over the years, Blizzard has provided players with various tools and resources, such as the Battle.net Authenticator and Account Security Awareness pages, to help you keep your account information safe, secure, and in the right hands. As part of our ongoing commitment to account security, we’re happy to announce the release of a new account security feature, the Battle.net Dial-in Authenticator.<br />
<br />
Similar to the Battle.net Authenticator and Mobile Authenticator application, the Battle.net Dial-in Authenticator is an optional tool that provides an additional layer of security against unauthorized account access. The Battle.net Dial-in Authenticator is not a physical token or application run on a mobile device, however. Instead, it is a free opt-in service that will actively monitor an account and request additional authorization from the user when a potentially unauthorized login attempt occurs. (Pretty cool, huh?)<br />
<br />
If you sign up for the Battle.net Dial-in Authenticator, you will be asked to make a toll-free phone call from a specific phone of your choosing to authorize unusual login attempts with the associated Battle.net account. Please note that you will only be asked to make this phone call when something about your login attempt appears out of the ordinary. For example, if you were to log in from a location from which you do not typically play, you may be asked to call in and provide your selected PIN and a unique, single-use security code before access to the account will be granted.<br />
<br />
Sign-up and use of the Battle.net Dial-in Authenticator is completely free and is currently compatible with World of Warcraft and Battle.net Account Management logins. So, what are you waiting for? To learn more about this service and find out how you can take your account’s security to the next level, check out the Battle.net Dial-in Authenticator FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article/dialinauth) today.<br />

Cataclysm Beta: Battlegrounds Developer Focus Test<br />
http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/1116853#blog]Attention[/url], Cataclysm beta testers! Want your shot at camping developers at the graveyard? This Thursday, November 11 beginning at 4 p.m. PST, we'll be holding a focus test for Rated Battlegrounds on the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm beta realms. If you want to participate, all you have to do is form a raid group with nine other players and queue for Rated Battlegrounds. We'll be conducting this test in a 10- vs. 10-player setting using Warsong Gulch, Twin Peaks, and Battle for Gilneas as the locations, so be prepared for some sweet, sweet ownage. We're hoping to receive lots of feedback about Rated Battlegrounds, Twin Peaks, and Battle for Gilneas, so be sure to visit our official beta forums. You could be up against a team of developers in any given match, so be sure not to go easy on your opponents, especially if you see names like Mumper and Kalgan!<br />
<br />
Lastly, be sure to keep the PvP momentum up by testing the new system. We want to make our new Rated Battlegrounds the best they can be!</div></div><hr />

Looks like it. I remember seeing a leveling achievement for worge and goblins where reaching 85 and completing the starting zones were requirements to ensure only characters made from scratch got the achievement. Guess they removed those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Worgen and Goblin won't get Realm first level 85 worgen or goblin, since there are no race realm first achievements. If a worgen or goblin were the first of their class to level 85, they would get an achievement though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sounds to me like you can get realm first with a goblin or worgen.<br />
Say you race change a undead mage to a goblin mage and still get the realm first level 85, but they removed the &quot;Realm first goblin lvl 85&quot; or &quot;Realm first troll lvl 85&quot; ....<br />
<br />
So to ruga, you can still get the realm first as goblin or worgen, they simply changed it to be with any class instead of any race</div></div><hr />

Sounds like a double nerf and a little buff. I think that 30% damage reduce could be used on some bosses that do heavy aoe (where you have to stack), like twin valkniys on heroic where players had to pop paly aura thingy.</div></div><hr />

Wrong. Even an MMO has to have a &quot;gold&quot; version. That's the version that goes on the disks.</div></div><hr />

However there will be no Realm First achievements associated with leveling characters of a specific race.&quot;<br />
<br />
It sounds to me like you can get realm first with a goblin or worgen.<br />
Say you race change a undead mage to a goblin mage and still get the realm first level 85, but they removed the &quot;Realm first goblin lvl 85&quot; or &quot;Realm first troll lvl 85&quot; ....<br />
<br />
So to ruga, you can still get the realm first as goblin or worgen, they simply changed it to be with any class instead of any race<br />
<br />
If u are a worgen or a goblin who hasn't done the chain quests in Kezan and Gilneas u wont be available to earn realm's first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I exited the game, check MMO-champ and see Shen'dralar was removed from the insane, HAHA, awesome. So it looks now &quot;the insane&quot; is completely achievable in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Of course, I completely empathize with the guys that did it before, I heard Shen'dralar was the hardest. Libram prices will now go down faster than a hooker on speed.</div></div><hr />

Wrong!!! <br />
Reading is hard.<br />
<br />
Now you can get &quot;Realm first MAGE lvl 85&quot;, &quot;... WARRIOR lvl 85&quot;, etc even if you are a racechanged goblin/worgen.<br />
And you can't get &quot; Realm first HUMAN lvl 85&quot;, &quot;Realm first TAUREN lvl 85&quot;, etc. Because this achievements were removed from game.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I just checked on Cataclysm beta, Bloodsail Buccaneers, Steamwheedle and Ravenholdt are there and the reputation gain methods are still working.<br />
A small modification on Ravenholdt is that the initial way to raise it to honored by killing syndicate mobs is gone, as the mobs have been removed. But the boxes turn in repeatable quest is there.</div></div><hr />

There is no logical reason to not allow race changes and a few good ones to do. For example the extra profit Blizzard will make (which you for some reason think is bad, hate capitalism much?) and people who don't like levelling alts can actually play the race they enjoy from the get-go.</div></div><hr />

Expansions, however, do &quot;go gold&quot; because they have to be RTM (Released to Manufacturer. Look, I can use fancy industry terms too!) in order to produce the boxed releases. If this were a patch, like 3.3 it would never go gold. Since Blizz had to give something to manufacturing to put in your retail copy though, there'll have to be a &quot;gold&quot; version soon. It won't matter much though, whatever they put on the DVD will be patched as soon as you install anyway.</div></div><hr />

Look at the date the post was up , blizz ripped from him lol .<br />
<br />
If you read the post, you'll see that the poster did not create this model. He simply datamined the new troll druid epic flight form texture from the beta client (the data can be there without the model being implemented yet) and applied it to a standard bat model, which explains the lower poly count, how it doesn't match up perfectly, etc. In other words, Blizzard didn't 'rip' the model from anyone.<br />
The only thing I worry about with the troll druid epic flight form is that it might look awkward flying at 280, or 310% speed. Also, will it have a sitting animation, like the current night elf and tauren flight forms do?<br />
<br />
I need the moonkin hatchling. Now. It's nice to know Blizzard actually does read the suggestion forum.<br />
<br />
Hearing that race changes will be available on day one is great news. I don't like male night elves, and female night elf druids will never sit well with me, so I'm looking forward to race changing my moonkin to a worgen. I'm still hoping that they roll out an updated moonkin form at the last minute- a white moonkin with night elf ears shouldn't be the model for a worgen moonkin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed. So such ludicrous achievements shouldn't be out of the ordinary. Being a game doesn't mean everything has to be at the low level :) I hear it all too often &quot;It's just a game!&quot; Problem is that's 100% purely subjective. A game means a lot of different things to each individual who plays it. Having some things in a game being completely ridiculous is a good thing, I think.<br />
<br />
<br />
The grind is just another thing to do but not a necessity to &quot;win the game&quot;. Years down the road when the average player dies from their obesity , I highly doubt their eulogy will include &quot;... and man, did he/she earn awesome points by getting a hard achievement in a video game!&quot; But to each their own. Get butthurt, don't get butthurt, all up to the individual I suppose. <br />
<br />
It's normal for people who have achieved something, to be angry when their achievement gets watered down by changes from above. It's just odd that people get angry at those people who get angry. :confused:<br />
<br />
<br />
Want to study something? Make a study on why everyone seems to think WoW is a second job and defines who a person is. THAT would yield far more interesting results.<br />
<br />
Hmm, not sure how this relates to anything. Except perhaps an odd perception that the people who achieve these things view the game as a second job and that achievements having an effect on a persons identity in game is a strange thing. Or that having anything in a game that takes a long time is a bad thing. Will need clarification :)<br />
<br />
Edit: I really need to stop posting on topics I care so little about :p</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benggaul</div><div class="date">2010-11-10, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was one of those who was slowly working on Shen'Dralar for the achievement when they suddenly announced that it would not be possible come Cataclysm. This is after they had announced earlier in the year that it WOULD still be doable in Cataclysm, so we didn't have to rush it. Seeing as how PBD's were never in our AH before the second announcement and I had to farm all of the ones I needed, the process was very slow going.<br />
<br />
So, after determining that there was no way I'd be able to complete that achievement before Cata, I gave all of my farmed librams and leftover diamonds to a guildmate who was also working on the achievement but was a lot further along than I was. Together he, I and a few of our guildmates went to work gathering as much as we could to get him to exalted so that he, at least, could get the achievment. Two days ago, he got it, and there was a minor celebration in guild chat over it.<br />
<br />
With this news, it kind of makes that effort semi-pointless (though his exalted rep will still count towards the 55 needed for one of the guild achievements), but neither of us are very upset about it. We're certainly not upset at the people who complained to Blizzard that what they were doing was unfair, because it really was. Blizzard screwed up by assuring us it would still be available and then yanking the carpet out from under us with only a month or so to go. This part of the achievement was hard enough as it is...putting a time limit on it made it pretty much impossible for most of us, especially given competition from other &quot;Insane&quot; seekers on your server.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think instead of removing the reputation from the FoS, they should have created a new turn-in quest in Cata that basically amounted to the same thing. I really don't think that would have taken too much development time away from the rest of the Cataclysm crew considering they've done (or re-done) upwards of 3000 quests already for the expansion.</div></div><hr />

- Bloodsail reputation as an &quot;Insane&quot; part of the achievement is abit of a joke. It not even remotely hard to get. I got it as the first rep and it took me one evening to do.<br />
- Ravenholdt I got in around 4 days of farming lockboxes <br />
<br />
So those are the most trivial ones to get.<br />
<br />
Darkmoon Faire was the hardest part for me. Hard because I farmed (excluding 1-3 missing cards per last 20 decks from friend) all of the mats myself and didnt buy almost any cards of AH (Less than 10 cards total) Basicly at the 2nd last DMF before Cata I had farmed around 2500 Primal Life (+ the corresponding ink :P)</div></div><hr />

I would like to hear one valid reason, just one reason why ppl should NOT be allowed to race/faction change to Goblin/Worgen from day one.<br />
<br />
And no, &quot;because i don't like it&quot; is not a valid reason, that's an opinion.<br />
There is no need to learn2play the class, most ppl play the class they are going to play in cata anyway. it's just a cosmetic thing.<br />
<br />
Learn2play the race is moot point, i go back and do the starting area with an alt to see all the beauty blizzard has put into it after 2/3 months into the xpac.<br />
It's all about the money, and blizzard knows that.<br />
<br />
If i can switch on day1 ill shelfout 20euro (25 in my case since i am faction changeing also), if i have to wait a 6weeks/6months like some here say i rather levelup a new DK. and they loose money.<br />

Now you can get &quot;Realm first MAGE lvl 85&quot;, &quot;... WARRIOR lvl 85&quot;, etc even if you are a racechanged goblin/worgen.<br />
And you can't get &quot; Realm first HUMAN lvl 85&quot;, &quot;Realm first TAUREN lvl 85&quot;, etc. Because this achievements were removed from game.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I guess reading IS hard for you since what he said is actually right. If you're a goblin/worgen who has NOT done the starting quests, you can't get realm firsts for that race.</div></div><hr />

Regarding the restriction on race changes from Worgen or Goblins- Why is this? Are these areas only accessible by those races? Kind of like Acherus being DK-only?<br />
<br />
Because with Azerothian Navigation that would seem a bit counterintuitive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check the Blue: &quot;However there will be no Realm First achievements associated with leveling characters of a specific race.&quot;<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if you did starting quests or not. No realm firsts for specific races. You can get realm first ROGUE (even if you're a worgen), but you can't get a realm first achievement simply for being the first worgen to 85.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's hard there exactly? &quot;There will be NO Realm First achievements associated with leveling characters of a specific RACE.&quot; The person you quoted was exactly right. This is either a change from their earlier decision to give racial Realm Firsts, but only give them to Goblin/Worgen who completed the leveling quest, or it's a mistake on the part of the Blue (unlikely but possible). In any case according to *this* Blue post, there will be NO racial Realm Firsts.<br />
<br />
<br />
To race change FROM a goblin or worgen, you have to be in either Kezan or Gilneas.<br />
Goblin and worgen characters wishing to change race or faction cannot be in Lost Isles or Gilneas; they must be elsewhere to initiate the process.<br />
Again, the reading... it is hard. The Blue says exactly the opposite of what you posted. You *cannot* be in Kezan or Gilneas when you race change *from* Goblin or Worgen. The reason is obvious. These are phased zones like the Death Knight starting area, they *only* make sense for Goblins or Worgens. Having an Orc suddenly sitting in Kezan would a) break immersion and b) possibly break the zone. They probably wouldn't be able to finish the quest chain that leads to getting out of the phase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My question to the beta testers is if the Shen'dralar faction has been removed or changed in Cataclysm? I suspect Blizzard is removing that faction requirement due to a change to the faction itself in Cataclysm rather than them wanting to nerf an achievement.<br />
<br />
I just googled up on Shen'dralar and apparently they are rejoining the Night Elves to teach them arcane magic ... in other words, they are going to be responsible for the introduction of night elf mages.<br />
<br />
Perhaps that is why they are being removed, since the Shen'dralar faction will become an Alliance-aligned faction and it'd cut the Horde off from interacting with them.</div></div><hr />

First all the elitest asses QQed to blizzard becouse Blizzard was gonna remove the whole achivment and thay dint have time to complete it, now the same people QQ about that they kept the achivment but removed one part of it. <br />
<br />
Noobs and Casuals dont even know that this achivment exists, you cant see it in the achivment section! so why would thay QQ? do you think Casuals have time to grind that much?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Funny thing is that i got about 4k gold on the Shen'dralar books when i read about the change, i had about 30 books banked in my Gbank and sold the all, last one sold yesterday:) <br />
and now i still can do the achivment:) only Darkmoon left!!:) Whooo me!<br />
<br />
<br />
And for people that are crying about that the Insane achivment is easy now and that everyone will get it, and their dogs too! Are forgeting about DARKMOON REP, Darkmoon is even harder then Shen'dralar and still need an Insane amount of herbs and Decks, and the other reps are not that easy eather<br />

Yes, they took a completely ludicrous part of the FoS out. After grinding away and repeatedly watching 2-4 repeat librams (not an engineer) just rot away every run, I don't feel like it's a nerf at all. Somehow everyone is thinking that now that this part is nixed that they'll be handing out the FoS like halloween candy to kids. There are still plenty of &quot;insane&quot; parts to it (lockbox gathering, pirate/cartel rep grind, etc) that most are not going to be willing to waste their time doing, especially the lockbox part if they're not a rogue.<br />
<br />
Think of it like this: If you've done it before the nerf, then you have yet another reason to stroke your epeen while you sit in trade chat spamming about how much more awesome you are and are the bestest ever at WoW.<br />
<br />
Grinding about 1.6k heavy junkboxes takes less than a days gameplay, that's easy.<br />
There was a nerf on the bloodsails, you just need to reach honored then you don't need to stay there anymore, so you can just do the turn-in repeatables. All of this is done in less than a day.<br />
Darkmoon Faire is just having a scribe doing a shitton of cards, which is somewhat mediocre. The shen'dralar could ofc be bought out in the whole big thing, but grind wise of all the reps, this was the hardest over anything.<br />
This IS a major nerf.<br />
How much more awesome? No, how much time we spent to show dedication in one way or another.</div></div><hr />

At the time when it came out, taking as much time it took to do it was hard to dedicate yourself to and doing it was still hard due to drop rates and people (for me at least) not selling the stuff you needed so had to get everything and hope for the drops, the time it takes in overall is a hard thing.</div></div><hr />

Not realy on my server librams were realy cheap the last week, about 60-70g each, much concurrence, we have at least 30 librams of each kind on AH, i think i was luck that i sold mine for 150-200g each <br />
<br />
about Darkmoon, no is not &quot;hard hard&quot; but still is take some time, on my server the herbs you need for the decks are eather like 100g a stack or sold out, so you need to be herb/scriber or have one who can do it for you, <br />
and think about it you need about 1080 deck, librams you only needed 84. yea librams and diamonds cost more but they not that many, and with herbs you are not even sure that you get the ink you need, so it depends on how you see it and what your resources are<br />
<br />
im not saying that Darkmoon is harder or easyer then Shen'dralar, but you cant say that they achivment will be easy with Shen*dralar removed, even if it wont be as hard as before, still Darkmoon, Ravenhold, and killing all the damn Pirates will take some time, and i dont think amy people can do it even whitout Shen*dralar</div></div><hr />

Looks like they CAN get the realm firsts, BUT (and its a big but), they will only stand a chance if they are race changed to Goblins/Worgen... but then with the time it takes to do the race change.... its very unlikely they will be able to race to the realm firsts.</div></div><hr />

It's a freaking flying rodent with the most ugliest mug out of entire animal kingdom, it is -=REPULSIVE=-. Worst pick ever for a playable character appearance.. Well, maybe a maggot would be worse a bit, but anyways..<br />
<br />
Not to mention that blizzard has COMPLETELY screwed up bats anatomy in WoW and it has not got fixed in this model, obviously, becaue blizzard is lazy. You may think it's not a big deal, but this particular issue completely breaks any possible way that thing could fly. The flying membrane is NOT attached to 2 points on the legs with a huge flailing gap in between it, it is in fact an extention of body skin and fur to full length, you'd think the membrane gets so much pressure while flapping that it will tear out of those lollable joint points in WoW. The next severe anatomy mistake is the stumpy butt with rudimentary legs and no tail. WTH is this, have they never seen a bat hanging head down from something ilke a roof or a tree branch, asleep while holding with its hind legs? Yes, they need those hind legs, not only to cling on something but also WALK if flying is not possible, as well as tail to steer the membrane while flying. Go google images of &quot;bat anatomy&quot; and see how it SHOULD have been done.. Well, i can post it for you here -<br />
http://www.theanimalfiles.com/images/bat_anatomy.jpg<br />
WoW bats are just a fail so much, it's pathetic. And you are gonna have this as your player model. Congrats.<br />
<br />
Oh. and the Batman superman kind of reference.. Batman was cool not because he had a bat sign on his shirt, i'd say in spite of it. It does not make all the repulsive rodents out there of this family automatically a badass-uber-zomg thing, you know. This is a very weak association chain. I'd say Thundercats superman reference is a lot stronger in druid case yet rarely seen among the players. The same will happen with the bat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well alright? It's possibly easy now cause people finally figured out about the insane being &quot;removed&quot; thus starting to sell librams, making it a lot easier. But take it into consideration, without any help, what would be harder? 80*2 (Librams and pristine black diamonds) which low drop rates, against grinding the herbs for darkmoon faire, that's a lot easier than hoping for items to drop. Just to compare it ;)<br />
Ravenholdt, Bloodsail and Booty bay can be done in less than a day or so. The only thing that'd take a bit longer would be Ravenholdt, grind the mobs, get 1.6k heavy junkboxes, with the right rotation of mobs it takes no time.<br />
Bloodsails to honored is a joke, get it from revered to exalted, try that :P I mean, kill booty bay guards for 2-4 hours or so, done with bloodsail and since you don't need to keep bloodsails at honored anymore you can just do turn-in's for the Steamwheedle Cartel reputation.</div></div><hr />

Bloodsail rep takes about 4 hours, Goblin rep takes about 6 hours, maybe 1 day's worth of gameplay for Ravenholdt, and if you have a scribe and a herbalist Darkmoon Faire takes maybe a week worth of farming, depending on the route you go for the rep. If Blizzard is going to remove the hardest aspects of achievements due to QQ, why not remove Thaddius as a requirement to The Immortal, or remove the Faction Champions from 25 man Dedicated Insanity. <br />
<br />
Also, Blizzard should please raise the rep gained from WSG and AB wins, it's too hard to get Justicar right now.:D</div></div><hr />

There is no logical reason to not allow race changes and a few good ones to do. For example the extra profit Blizzard will make (which you for some reason think is bad, hate capitalism much?) and people who don't like levelling alts can actually play the race they enjoy from the get-go.<br />
<br />
I agree there isnt any LOGICAL reason to not let people do that...... however, I personally think that this means we will be swamped with lvl80 worgen and goblins from the word go. It doesnt really &quot;matter&quot; and there isnt any lore reason why this shouldnt be... but im not personally keen on it.</div></div><hr />

To the people saying the Troll bat form doesn't make any sense, you do realise that the trolls Racial Mount since Warcraft 3 have always been giant bats right? They were using Giant bats long before the forsaken were. So really, its an animal their culture has been around and respected for a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, it seems some people have a hard time understanding why those who have it already are upset by this news..... I can see two reasons why they would be upset...<br />
<br />
1. They dont want others to get something they had - only easier. Personally I dont support this one, its just elitist and I couldnt care less about elitism.<br />
<br />
2. They feel &quot;cheated&quot; by Blizzard by having to do all that work (and yes I know they didnt HAVE to) for an achievement only for the requirement to be removed shortly after meaning that they could have waited and got the achievement easier and with less expense. I completely understand this one - its like buying a new PC only to find that the next week it becomes obsolete and you could have got one MUCH better just a week later instead. It makes you feel that the supplier (in this case Blizzard) could have warned about this ahead of time.<br />
<br />
Anyway - my 2p worth</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you should try and make a list of everything in the game that's not respecting real world anatomy laws / laws of physics, etc... and analyze it. I'll be waiting for your 2000 pages report.

My problem is that they can't stop backpedaling, I mean: First they say they are not gonna remove the feat, then that although they are gonna keep the feat some of the reps are not gonna be doable after 4.0.3( and PBD and libram market explodes) and now that Shen'dralar is not gonna be needed. And this in less than 2 weeks and not even knowing when exactly 4.0.3 was gonna arrive and make these changes relevant.</div></div><hr />

And too all of you who started to farm insane after it was told it was getting removed stop the QQing you could have done this a long time ago if u wanted.. <br />
<br />
But damm you blizzard for making this game too easy for everyone<br />
<br />
It's just a nerf to the difficulty of an achievement - did you look at the raft of class nerfs in this post. Insane in the membrane isn't about difficulty, it's about patience, it's a time sink with a pretty title at the end of it.<br />
<br />
I don't think this is a case of things getting easier - insane is a marginal (if very difficult and time consuming to get) achievement and it's having one of it's requirements taken away It's still going to take a long time to get that. If you were one of the ones who farmed the rep and got the title, then good for you, you can feel all superior to all those who do it now without needing shen'dralar rep. But I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is making the game so much easier when it's an achievement rewarded for patience, and not skill.<br />
<br />
achievements like this are one of those things that sit in your mind on a shelf labelled 'do when i really have nothing better to do' i can understand why people are trying to get this now, it's a 'dammit i wanted that, lets see if i can do it before it goes away' moment.<br />
<br />
Good luck to anyone trying to get it before removal - myself, i've never been tempted. If it weren't for the tabard system in wrath, i'd not have gotten a single faction to exalted lol. I have no patience</div></div><hr />

Let's play a game where we read the article before we talk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay So I've exported vampiric bat model from the game and Applied the textures from the newest build<br />
That's the result (yes there is no masking on hair texture for strange reason)<br />
Oh well at least it will give ya an idea how it's going to look like.&quot;<br />

It only took me 2days to get the Wintersaber mount (@lvl 68, I got it before heading to Northrend on my DK. I wanted to level in style~.^)<br />
<br />
When did Blizz release Twin Peaks? This is the first I'm hearing about it. I thought Battle for Gilneas was the new BG, I didn't even consider a SECOND even cooler BG...<br />
Tol'Barad, Battle for Gilneas, and Twin Peaks... Color me excited ^.^</div></div><hr />

Oh, that is a relief! And yes, same. More for like a year, but I haveb een taking a lot of breaks from it, focusing on other achievements. But yes, I totally know what you mean. I started to hurry on it, and today a guildie posted that blue. I was so mad and sent back the PBDs to him. After reading a lot on mmo, I decided I still wanted to do it.

&quot;Hmm... They seem to be divided between images of a serpent spirit and a bird spirit. No self-respecting Darkspear troll engages in bird worship. Their spirits are weak, capricious, and best left to the Amani.<br />
But the serpent, &lt;name&gt;, the serpent wields considerable power and this is the spirit I shall study. &quot;-Seer Janidi, Spirits of the Feralfen quest.<br />
<br />
Trolls would most likely follow a windserpent or a bat as these are animals special to their Loa, Troll druidism is different from Tauren, Worgen and Nightelf in that the Loa empower their followers to become animals as shown by the animal-troll hybrids in Zul'Gurub, Zul'Aman, and Zul'Drak. on occasion Trolls become power crazy, or just plain crazy and seek to steal the powers of the Loa/Primal Gods and effect a transformation this way-see Zul'Aman/Zul'Drak for examples.<br />
Tauren/Nightelf druidism springs from the same source, and thus is makes some sense for the Stormcrow to be their form, as it does for the Worgen. The animals chosen as forms have little bearing on the animals found in the local environment of the aforementioned races save where they are also the animals of Loa/Primal Gods.<br />
While all their forms are suitable for the location the race arises from, it is not the location that makes the form, but rather the source of the trans-formative powers that dictates the animal form.</div></div><hr />

It seems that Blizzard thought 5 buttons were too much for us to cope with, and now just want our rotation to be:<br />
<br />
Open with: Serpent Sting<br />
Then: Cobra Shot, Cobra Shot, Cobra Shot, Cobra Shot, Cobra Shot, Cobra Shot, Cobra Shot &lt;repeat&gt;<br />

<br />
surprisingly giving a shit about what you look like dosn't mean you are a moron but I can understand how morons can make that mistake. The Bat form is hideous and so many people can only back up the decision from one quote from one troll or one one or so bosses (you know, the bad guys who go crazy and attack you because they have different beliefs). Some white people are raceist, does that mean all are? didn't think so. So you can go on believeing that everything has a fine line but I'll see that there are more options out there then the simple minded ones. <br />
<br />
I'm sure you have never been in any hurry to get anywhere and actually had to wait and possibly get killed in some places because of a mount cast time. On PVP servers a quick flight get away could mean the difference between a corpse run or smooth sailing away. So I guess you didn't think of everything all by yourself, dear (if we are going to use patronizing pronouns to make ourselves feel much more confident in our troll responses)<br />
<br />
Less douche-baggy than responses like &quot;the last DJ&quot; and on more on a productive line of thought, I can only hope that for whatever reason Blizzard scraps this bat-form for something better like a windrider or a parrot or have a glyph to change the look like I mentioned before, however unlikely that may be...</div></div><hr />
