I guess some of those quest achievements are going to be faction exclusive....<br />
<br />
That said. If someone faction transferred, would you retain them or would they change to the corresponding factional achievement? (For example, the darkshore quest achievement would change into the Azshara rocketway achievement).<br />
<br />
And yes I understand no one would know the answer for sure right now. I'm just asking to open discussion. :P</div></div><hr />

just useless change and a useless talent. i said it. for retributions this talent is useless. The very thing blizzard said they no longer wanted in the game, for prot paladins - it has its uses, but isn't great. In retribution i wouldn't be seen dead with this.<br />
<br />
sigh. blizz blizz blizz, you say one thing but go ahead and do it anyway...<br />
<br />
as much fail as thinking another BG is a good thing, when after WG and TB, BGs will be dead. Unless they're rated (how on earth are they going to convince 40 alliance v 40 horde i'll never know, and if it's not 40v40 it ain't AV)</div></div><hr />

UMMMM if you missed it, fury just got a 20% damage boost with TG, and a 5% boost with SMF. I guess i don't get SMF, I felt it was lagging behind TG, esp with the weapon differences. Think you should go wake up, recheck the post, and see what they did.</div></div><hr />

You're kidding, right? The ICC epics will be outdated by Level 85 dungeon blues. They're making it 85 because Blizzard &quot;wanted leveling to feel more meaninful&quot;. However, I think they wanted to stretch out 80-100 a few more expansions :)<br />

Yeah, but Blizzard is usually very up-to-date on pop culture, and searching &quot;You've been iced&quot; on google brings up a LOT of stuff about a new game, played with smirnoff ice, that is EXACTLY the kind of thing blizzard makes achievements based on. The mafia has nothing to do with it. That's why they put the text &quot;figure it out&quot; in there. What's the first thing you'd do? Google the achievement. Voila. Instant clue.</div></div><hr />

So are these only patches out as still to get like &quot;The Insane&quot; so reduce the nummber of tabs in the achievement panal ?<br />
<br />
Or are the Titels going to be like Hand of Adal and Champion of the Naru aka too easy with 4.01 and therefore Patches out. But by this logic Kingslayer, Light of Dawn and Bane of the Fallen King should be Feat of Strenght too ??! *confused*<br />
<br />
All these achievements are connected with someone wiping at any point of the encounter and are therefore removed..i mean even with 85 disconnects can kill you at Kel Thuzad or Saphiron.<br />
<br />
Can anyone in Beta confirm that these Feat of Strength are going to be like &quot;The Insane&quot; aka they are just &quot;invisible&quot; until you get them !<br />

I am sorry but this just sounds weird, SURE they are getting a 10% boost to TG for sure, but to say you can use a 2hder in one hand, sorta says just in case you want to only wield one is dumb. Will have to check this in game, I swear its not going to have a penalty at all now.</div></div><hr />

Well, unfortunately that is what it is... currently on the PTR you still get the 10% penalty for wielding one 2h, think of what they are doing as a fix for something that should never have happened in the first place. Should only be a penalty for dual wielding them, otherwise the nerf to Single-Minded Fury would have no justification as removing the 10% penalty to TG would be way too huge in comparison to the 20% SMF currently has on the PTR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TG fury gets a 20% damage increase and SMF only gets 25%...... I sense something wrong here.... but mostly what I sense is a possible TG nerf or SMF buff. Honestly, it was mentally retarded for Blizzard to nerf SMF when they gave TG such a huge damn buff. I mean, wasn't that 10% damage back in early Wrath a huge chunk of fury dps? I'm just hoping that once the build goes up on the beta that they realize that nerfing SMF was a big mistake because now it won't be able to compete with TG. I thought the whole point was for the damage to be balanced between the two so people can choose whichever they prefer and not which is the bigger dps increase.</div></div><hr />

Well see that is currently the problem, and to answer others questions, there is no build available for the PTR or the BETA, this just prepatch info that boub has. So what your seeing on the PTR is now outdated and the 10% your seeing is the 10% reduction from TG in your talents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shockadin is back in force. It's even back somewhat on the ptr. I think it will make a nice comeback. Mixing healing with damage will be nice. Won't be as good as a pure healer, or pure dps, but say in a raid where you need a little extra healing, but don't want to sacrifice a dps it will be the perfect fit. I am just going to go ahead and call it though, it will be nerfed. This seems to be the expansion of cataclysm for paladins, nerfing them to the ground seems to have been the main goal set out by designers.</div></div><hr />

Also cool to see they're changing some racials around.

I hope they remove Dwarf's treasure finding to get Mining Specialization with a similar bonus (and replace Everyman while they're at it).<br />
<br />

<br />
In the words of Doc Brown, &quot;Great Scott!!&quot; It looks like we have our Worgen mount, sans mount. If implemented right visually, this'll be better than having the bear-wolf-pig mount.<br />
<br />
By the way, something like this would be an excellent idea for druids, even if it keeps the 1.5 cast time (though I suggest either changing that to 1 sec cast, or implementing a feral-only speed-boost talent, just to spice things up ;) ). Having an entire class that can shapeshift into something that IS the mount rather than on a mount will liven up cities that would otherwise be infested with drakes (because if PTR is any indication, you can use your flying mounts even if you can't fly).</div></div><hr />

Indeed, this is just a mount if you look at it technically. It has a casttime and doesnt require you to run for at least 10 sec or what.<br />

Sure, but since they are cows, its should be 10% at lvl 20, and 20% at lvl 60.<br />

<br />
The reason it was removed in ye olden days was twofold. 1), it had a speed buildup (the tauren had to activate it, then run for a few seconds to actually get up to speed), and 2), it had a delay in dismounting that other mounts did not. As far as this new spell goes, neither applies. Which means it'll work perfectly fine. That aside, if they DID do it they'd have to add 2 other alliance-exclusive mounts to fix the disparity. Wait... Wicked theory. What if this is in fact a new mount - a WORGEN MOUNT? They only need to add &quot;letting a gnome or dwarf hop onto your back&quot; at the end of the spell description and we're golden.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cornicer</div><div class="date">2010-09-18, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Running Wild sounds VERY cool(another reason to race change to worgen), and I'm not much of a mount completionist(I love mounts, but only ones I actually like) so it doesn't bother me too much that they might not get a racial mount.<br />
<br />
BUT, I wouldn't be surprised if we see this either as a racial alternative to a racial mount, OR if we'll see Alliance get an extra reputation mount(or something) in compensation since Blizz seems pretty mindful of keeping the amount of mini-pets and mounts equal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Plains running didn't work with tauren... I hope its a place holder to get Worgen fans to shutup about their mount... Still hoping for boar! PLEASE NO HORSES!<br />
<br />
The problem with Plains Running had nothing to do with it not being an actual mount. It had a 10 second(or something like that) ramp up period, plus it probably looked pretty silly seeing tauren running that quickly.<br />
<br />
This, on the other hand, seems to work the same as any other mount, plus Worgen already have animations for it to not look ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

There's no new mount achievements being added, and with all the new faction mounts they'll be adding into the game, both sides could easily hit 100 to get the achievement.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrendanBauer</div><div class="date">2010-09-18, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are people seriously THAT angry that the Horde will have two mounts more, while The Alliance has the ability to be a Worgen and run on all fours?! These are HUMANS who have been CURSED. That's their story. So if they had a mount, it'd be another damn horse, since they aren't going to have super-wolfman-mounts or some other huge beast they've tamed...since their story is about being cursed and joining forces with the Night Elves and the Alliance.<br />
<br />
Seriously, this is some of the coolest news, and the Dark Runners in Duskwood already have the animation, so it's quite a cool thing they're bringing to the table here. All the mount collectors can stop crying, as there are plenty of mounts out there that I'm sure most don't have, and getting two more mounts just by grinding to exalted with the new faction shouldn't be a big loss...especially since they'd likely be more HORSES.<br />
<br />
If this is the new Worgen mount form, I'm happy. Mount collector's shouldn't care because it's not a 'mount' so they don't lose anything, and the 'imbalance' from Horde to Alliance shouldn't matter because if that is seriously something you lose sleep over in life, then you really have your priorities out of whack.</div></div><hr />

I don't see why that wouldn't work (unless people start QQing about it, that is)<br />
<br />
PVP imbalance, can't tell if they are mounted or not. Darkflight has similar graphics.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, that's not going to last to live.<br />
<br />
+20% attack speed ALL THE TIME? That's 10x the effect of Bloodlust.<br />
<br />
Bloodlust is only +30%, and that's what, 40 seconds out of every 10 mins? (= +2% sustained, if my numbers are right)<br />

go look at the improved icy talons for frost dk it does the same thing...</div></div><hr />

It's a racial, and it's apparently a Level 20 spell. It also has a 1.5 sec cast time, like all the mounts spells. I don't want to say it yet, but that would explain why we never saw a model for the Worgen Mount.<br />

Plainsrunning all over!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see a problem with the Worgen not having a racial mount. It's not really necessary for them, as the Worgen mobs can run and sprint over long distances, so why can't the players? And when I think of a Worgen riding something else.... it just doesn't seem right.<br />
I'm sure we've all seen images or videos of the quest in the Worgen starting zone where you ride a horse, and I'm pretty sure we can all agree it looked ridiculous. It's also true that considering the Worgen were originally Human, their racial mount would be another Horse., not a Boar. Even if it was a Boar, it would look even more ridiculous.<br />
I'm not obsessive compulsive so I'm not driven to collect every single mount and achievement out there like some no-life basement-dwelling neckbeard.<br />
<br />
I fail to understand the whining and bawling of a lot of the commenters here.<br />
<br />
As for returning Plainsrunning to the Tauren, sure, seems like a fair idea. Although I think the animation would need to be updated. Hey how about tweaking that underwater running animation they recently implemented? I think that could work for the Tauren, taking huge long strides and moving at mount speed over the plains of Mulgore :)</div></div><hr />

They could just do like they've done previously and add 2 (or however many the Goblins actually get, if they decide to do multi-colored mounts) more mounts to a different race for Alliance. As for the &quot;PVP imbalance&quot; - There's tons of mods that show you how fast your target is moving, not just that, but why is it necessary anyways to &quot;know if they are mounted or not&quot;? They still wouldn't be able to carry flags, or be &quot;mounted&quot; indoors, so... I don't see the logic behind that complaint.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WRONG... target them and see if they have this aura up or not... not hard to figure out. also if this is like the npc animation they will actually be on all fours when this aura is on not standing up like normal.</div></div><hr />
