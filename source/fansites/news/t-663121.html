<br />
We’ll be releasing a minor bug fix patch to version 3.2.0a. This sort of patch is very small in size, and we use them to fix specific issues that can’t be hot-fixed. Issues addressed with this patch:<br />
<br />
* Fixed an exploit players were using with / commands<br />
* Fixed a performance issue with players logging into the game<br />
* Fixed an issue with Mac clients freezing near water<br />
* Fixed a crash Mac clients were experiencing with shadows on Fixed Function cards<br />
* Fixed an art issue with Freya Hard Mode where the light beams were visually too hard to see<br />
* Fixed an issue with Loaner mounts requiring Cold Weather Flying <br />
<br />
We will be bringing all realms down very soon for this small, but urgent patch. Downtime is expected to be quite minimal, as only rolling restarts will be required. Updating your game client will take only a small download.</div></div><hr />

I have a feeling that this fix would have happened regardless of when Blizzcon is.<br />

<br />

I doubt they'd be able to push that in a minor patch. Plus, it's my understanding that that is a hardware issue, not really a software one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To do a check on the hardware.<br />
<br />
That's the point of the weekly maintenance.<br />
<br />
And Rolling restarts to aplly a needed fix (i.e. the /dump macros) aren't that much of a problem, are they?</div></div><hr />

I have never had an issue with this. Not once.<br />

Wait, I take that back. Yes, once I had an issue where OS wouldn't load. But then we just did Ulduar, so it's OK.<br />

Stop being an idiot. You and everyone else that keeps posting and whining and moaning about this topic. Blizzard is working on it problem and things like this take time. Or would you rather they take your server off line for a week or more while they get all the parts, time, and service done to expand and install new instance servers?</div></div><hr />

This is what I was wondering about. No flash screens on the home page. Very little hype other that the &quot;leak&quot; which theoretically isn't supposed to happen.<br />
<br />
Maybe the hype is going to be something in game...<br />
<br />
Blizz is evil. Even when they don't hype something, it's hyping it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The few overpopulated servers having that issue are being fixed a few at a time. You'll have to watch your particular realm for updates, I imagine. When only your realm is having an extended maintenance and others aren't, that's likely to be when the problem disappears.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Fixed a performance issue with players logging into the game<br />
<br />
I hope this fixes the problem with the game client hanging in Dalaran (mouse still works but game freezes and eventually DCs)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Fixed an issue with Mac clients freezing near water<br />
<br />
So Macs are like the aliens in Signs?</div></div><hr />

Didn't you hear? Paladins got nerfed TO THE GROUND about 6 patches ago.<br />
<br />
Wait, what? Paladins cried so hard they got under-nerfed and are still over-powered? Then yeah - expect moar nerfs inc. Maybe one day you plate wearers can find a group with &lt; 4/5 plate. But plate classes have to stop being OP for that to ever happen...</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, that is exactly what i want them to do. at least then we would see progress. you clearly are not on an affected realm and have no empathy for those who have been paying (for several months now) to jump up and down at an instance portal. <br />
<br />
As it stands they give no timetable on when changes will happen and only the bare minimum amount of communication whatsoever. The players are left frustrated. This should be the NUMBER ONE PRIORITY for Blizzard to address, with DAILY UPDATES as to the progress.</div></div><hr />

What he means is, you won't see anything about it in a patch because it isn't something a patch can fix. Even once they improve their hardware and fix the problem, it won't come up in a patch.</div></div><hr />

You can get a flying mount in Northrend without having the training by getting a loaner one from a guy in K3. without the loaner you would either have to buy all the training and a mount or continue to level without doing quests in Storm Peaks or Icecrown.</div></div><hr />

There is a flying mount you can get free that works only in IC, SP &amp; SB. It's from they guy next to the flight point in K3.<br />

It currently was not working due to it thinking you needed cold weather flying, now it should be fixed.</div></div><hr />

Wait, I take that back. Yes, once I had an issue where OS wouldn't load. But then we just did Ulduar, so it's OK.<br />
<br />
If you hate it so much, just go to a lower pop server.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm on a low population server and this happens litterally all day. It's happening across probably more than half the realms. Read up on whats been going on before posting. :-\</div></div><hr />

You and everyone else that keeps posting and whining and moaning about this topic. Blizzard is working on it problem and things like this take time. Or would you rather they take your server off line for a week or more while they get all the parts, time, and service done to expand and install new instance servers?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi, I pay $15 a month for it. I don't pay money to not play the game. I don't care how long it takes, it should've been resolved by now. They've had plenty of time.</div></div><hr />

When they get around to fixing your battlegroup's hardware, the problem will be gone. So just have some patience, yeah? The reason each battlegroup is being done separately is because it requires the cooperation of and coordination with the owners of the server farm the battlegroup is located in. Blizzard doesn't 'own' the servers they use, they're owned by AT&amp;T or whoever, so it's not as easy as you'd think to upgrade this stuff.<br />
<br />
As someone who plays on the first battlegroup to get the hardware fix (months ago now), I'll assure you it works. We haven't seen that message 'additional instances cannot be launched' on our server for a long, long, long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have read up on it and I also know that Blizzard is working to resolve it. I don't personally work in IT, but I can imagine that adding more hardware their server farm is probably a much more daunting task than just jamming more RAM and it will automagically work.<br />
<br />
I'm just saying that I don't have these problems, so maybe if you cared about the 'quick fix' you should switch servers and quit bitching. I don't agree that it's fair for Blizzard to have broken instances and whatnot, but they have addressed the issue and said they are working on it. If it's a real problem for you, see if they can transfer your character for free or something due to the inconvenience.<br />
<br />
Sitting and whining on forums won't really fix much of anything.</div></div><hr />

It was a band-aid patch. They didn't actually fix it. I'm not going to go into details though. It will probably be fixed more cleanly in a future patch, but until then..</div></div><hr />

<br />
As it stands they give no timetable on when changes will happen and only the bare minimum amount of communication whatsoever. The players are left frustrated. This should be the NUMBER ONE PRIORITY for Blizzard to address, with DAILY UPDATES as to the progress. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is a game. <br />
<br />
What you have described is something required for Business and time sensitve software and services.<br />
<br />
No-one outside of Blizzard know what the cause of the problem is and are only guessing that it's hardware related. Unless you have some insight on the problem, shut your mouth and stop pollouting these threads with your brain dead mumblings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes! Erm, no!<br />
<br />
It's just that people found another loophole in the game to &quot;automate&quot; certain things which had affected Blizzard's fav plaything (Arenas) to an extent, where the outcome of the games they'll expect to hold at blizzcon would be definately been shifted toward certain fotm comps.<br />
<br />
And when's about the $$, Blizzard is indeed the fast one to act. ;D</div></div><hr />

I think in 3.1 those beams were perfectly visible like they are after this patch, but 3.2 bugged them, and now they fixed it =P<br />

Actually I have put in numerous GM tickets about this issue and they said that they intentionally limited the amount of instances that could be launched at any given time. This being the case, they created a priority system that they use to determine which instances are less likely to be locked out. Raids and newb dungeons are high on the list. Consequentially old world raids and BC content is low on the list.</div></div><hr />

Neither will telling somone else that you personaly dont have the same problem.<br />
<br />
Advising people to move server to resolve the issue is to put it bluntly silly.</div></div><hr />
