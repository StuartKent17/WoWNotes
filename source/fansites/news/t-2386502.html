Family Guy Warcraft Episode on April 1<br />
Family Guy announced that a Warcraft themed episode is coming on April 1st.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
PvP Hotfixes<br />
People on the arena forums are stating the Demonic PvP tabard was just hotfixed and replaced with the same one used in the Ferocious season. The Demonic one was complained about because it looked so bad. From what I can tell so far these reports are true.<br />
<br />
Why would that be hotfixed but not the Elite sets? They are both items on the exact same vendor.<br />
Hey guys! This is a bit off-topic for this thread and is a separate issue. It was identified this morning that the previous Demonic Tabard and Cloak didn't look demonic enough so the Ferocious ones were recolored and changed to be the new appearances. Thus looking far more Demonic to match the name.<br />
<br />
When you're comparing these things I would suggest looking at the kind of change it is to realize how they're different. For example, an art related change and a change related to adding an item attached to season ratings are very different changes that have different steps to alter them, especially when needing to use the in-game rating systems to verify who can obtain seasonal items from PVP. <br />
<br />
I know its frustrating to still not have something you've earned but like I previously stated we have the intention to give this to you guys sooner rather than later. I'm still continually reading the thread and have upped the cap again, as soon as I know more information I'll share it when I can.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle for Azeroth - PvP Talents<br />
PvP talents are not yet enabled on Alpha servers, and more information will be available once we move into more focused PvP testing. Don't worry though, players will have an opportunity to use PvP talents while leveling in Battle for Azeroth!<br />
<br />
Honorable Medallion is still granted to all characters once they enter PvP for the first time. We're also planning on unlocking access to PvP talents at a much lower level than in Legion.<br />

<br />
eh, it has suffered from the same thing spongebob and fairly oddparents suffered from. a lot of time passed, humor changed, it lost sophistication to surrealism and gross out.<br />
<br />
family guy used to be pretty good. i definitely liked it. peter's overall attitude now, much like spongebob's, is flat out retarded and borderline sociopathic. where as before, both characters were nonsensical, but within reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- There was an episode where they blamed a victim of an abusive relationship and tried to tell her she was wrong. The entire scene was played for straight. Kinda messed up.<br />
<br />
- They had a joke explaining and encouraging self inflicted harm. Explaining how to hurt yourself.<br />
<br />
- They lied about killing Brian for a ratings trap.<br />
<br />
- The show i full of heavy handed political pushing. Trying to shove seth's political views down your throat.<br />
<br />
- They've made multiple pedophilia jokes. One about baby porn, and another about giving oral sex to a toddler.<br />
<br />
There is a whole lot more but i can't stomach this crap. It's beyond desperate and no longer Family Guy imo. Some of these writters sound f'ed in the head. Possibly pedophiles themselves as they've tried to make us sympathize with herbert the pervert.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Errr .... no. The Last Jedi was actually just plain bad. It had nonsensical plot points, was badly edited, discarded major characters, other pointless characters, a stupid deus-ex ending escape, ... the list just goes on. Oh, how far the apple has fallen from the tree.</div></div><hr />

But without the reason or neuance of south park. Just a buncha idiots who think &quot;herr Derr Pedophilia is funny cuz they made a joke about it on south park!&quot; Without understanding the meaning behind the joke. South Park itself pretty much nailed the family guy writting style when they made fun of them.</div></div><hr />

South Park isn't really funny anymore either, just political in-your-face with maybe one actual joke per episode. &quot;Haha! I saw that in the news last week! Haha! They're mocking it! Haha!&quot; Onion articles are funnier than an entire episode<br />

<br />
uh i guess you dont get comedy...<br />
i dont enjoy the show, havent for years, but uhh that is some pretty fucking huge accusations you are making.<br />
For example there is movies out there who try to make us feel bad for the serial killer, does that make the author a serial killer?<br />
and again its comedy, sometimes if you try to make people feel bad for a bad person, then just make them even worse it has the &quot;Rug pulled out from under you&quot; effect and can accomplish alot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im pretty fucking sure seth rogan is not a pedophile making a show to try and get people on his side...<br />
btw your a preacher fan, alot of his comedy is pretty inmature, what do you have to talk about? (Im a fan too, but still)</div></div><hr />

Funny you should mention that. Honestly that hyperspace ramming stunt while visually amazing, completely unravels the franchise as a whole. It was the absolute WORST decision in star wars ever made for that sole reason.</div></div><hr />

i dont enjoy the show, havent for years, but uhh that is some pretty fucking huge accusations you are making.<br />
For example there is movies out there who try to make us feel bad for the serial killer, does that make the author a serial killer?<br />
and again its comedy, sometimes if you try to make people feel bad for a bad person, then just make them even worse it has the &quot;Rug pulled out from under you&quot; effect and can accomplish alot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im pretty fucking sure seth rogan is not a pedophile making a show to try and get people on his side...<br />
btw your a preacher fan, alot of his comedy is pretty inmature, what do you have to talk about? (Im a fan too, but still)<br />

Yeah you can say &quot;Pushing Seth's political views&quot; so i thought the person trying to call the creators of the show pedophiles they would know who the creators were.<br />

Empire Strikes Back had bombs dropping in space too. See the asteroid belt scene when the Empire is searching for the Falcon; you'll see TIE Bombers doing bombing runs. And who's to say the bombs aren't propelled rather than just &quot;dropped&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">splatomat</div><div class="date">2018-03-27, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Empire Strikes Back had bombs dropping in space too.

And who's to say the bombs aren't propelled rather than just &quot;dropped&quot;?<br />
<br />
Well, no. The TIE bombers don't actually carry &quot;bombs&quot;. They carry concussion missiles, proton torpedoes, grenades (thermal detonators), and mines. If you watch Empire Strikes Back, you can see the ordinance are blue (the actual weapon in flight, not just the blast) and they &quot;streak&quot; towards the asteroid, heavily implying that they're not being dropped - they're being fired (covered in some kind of plasma sheath like the proton torpedoes from A New Hope). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phGlo_TNDp0 <br />
<br />
Compare that to Last Jedi, where it very clearly appears that the bombs are just rolling off a rack and slowly tumble towards the dreadnought &quot;below&quot;. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oiT7Kkx630 The Visual Dictionary says they're using electromagnets to leave the bay, and then are pulled to their target magnetically. Technically, since they're being &quot;launched&quot; off the rails (like a really weak rail gun), the weapon functions more like a mortar firing shells. If you consider magnetic attraction a sort of guided propulsion, then then it's essentially a missile launcher. I don't know how the bombs differentiate a target they pull towards from other bombs or what they were launched from (the bomber), but I presume there's some sci-fi handwaving involved. <br />
<br />
Bombs and depth charges are dropped, though. That's what makes them bombs, and not missiles, rockets, torpedoes, mortar shells, or mines. <br />
<br />
Mostly I think Last Jedi wanted to create a WWII impression to inject some gravitas into a scene that really didn't have much (a theme that would replay throughout the movie's run). Whatever explanation they use, it still ended up looking stupid as hell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what about the gravity generators inside the ships ? that technology would not be usable on bombs aswell ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I had a choice between eating shit (Big Bang Theory) or dying slowly and painfully from a terminal illness (Family Guy), I'd say the former is the lesser of two evils.<br />
Needless to say, I would like to avoid either of those decisions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do watch Family Guy on and off and while it's not the greatest show out there can't really say much bad about it either.<br />
<br />
But it's a very low priority show for me. To be honest I only really watch it on and off as I said on ITV2 when there's nothing else for me to watch.</div></div><hr />
