Oh get over yourself already... it was a mistake and you should have flash blockers installed anyways..</div></div><hr />

Seriously. Google Chrome (and possibly Firefox) have this built in. I thought everyone knew you were supposed to block flash by default. If anything for the numerous annoying flash based ads that exist.</div></div><hr />

If you think the only thing separating &quot;casuals&quot; from the top 10 is getting a few pulls on a boss when it's available on PTR/Beta then you're in for a world of hurt.<br />
<br />
Also, which of us top 10 world guilds were streaming? I'm on vacation, so I don't know if we did, and I didn't see any of the others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Er, yes it should? They need to test it on the players to see if they're good enough/too dumb to work out strategies. Where else would you get your boss guides from in the first place for any content you do?</div></div><hr />

Stop the BETA raid contents for raiders like PARAGON etc etc . thats totally FUC** up.<br />
<br />
They will have realm first after cheating on a stupid beta test server for hours of training. STOP IT.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let others handle that job. <br />
<br />
ITS TOTALLY TAKING OUT THE FUN OF THIS GAME.<br />
<br />
or do it like this. every guild cheating on betas to do first realm. place them on a Island far away from the rest of us ...<br />
