Justice and Valor Conversion<br />
I understand Valor and Justice will be gotten rid of, so will their be a gold conversion with any left over or should we spend it all instead?<br />
The gold conversion for Justice and Valor Points will be made at 47 silver per point.<br />

Patch 6.0.2 - Wrath of the Lich King Commendation Badges Removed<br />
It looks like the Commendation Badges (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Commendation+Badge&amp;filter-source=6144) from Wrath of the Lich King are also going away, so be sure to buy them soon if you want to level up those reputations. You can see all of the things going away in Patch 6.0.2 in our recap (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4315-Patch-6-0-Reminders-Warlords-of-Draenor-Healing-Blue-Tweets-DLC-457).<br />

There's a real easy fix for this if you're so concerned... buy it with JP before the conversion.</div></div><hr />

This is Beta, not live. You're not entitled to play anything at any time. And in case you're unaware, Blizzard headquarters is based in the United States, their devs are always going to patch when they're asleep so they can continue development during the day.<br />
<br />

If past history is indicative, the conversion will occur with the systems patch (pre-expansion patch that gets things ready for the actual expansion). You definitely have through Monday to buy them (16 JP each). It is very iffy past that; Blizzard typically ends arena seasons two weeks prior to new PvE tier content, and that announcement came the week before last.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With about 5 weeks before release they actually have already completed their testing…they admitted so much a week or so ago when responding to similar complaints they basically stated that beta testers were merely stress testing the servers as opposed to being relied upon to provide encounter / overall design feedback (you can look up the blue post). In fact, with the exception of minor adjustments to spells like the ones contained in this new build the only thing you might see between now and release is one more tuning pass and they all ready have enough data to determine what those numbers will be.<br />
<br />
Essentially, the beta is still open for show purposes only….there won't be any significant changes and anything not already there (and this has been the case for several weeks now, if not months) won't be there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, the response they gave about the commendations was nothing about conversion. They just figure it will be a little too easy to buy with gold, and basically there's no massively pressing reason to keep them.</div></div><hr />

It's really not about entitlement, it's about doing my job as a beta tester. There are still so many bugs (some minuscule, some humongous) that plague the game (e.g. multistrike not affecting some core resto shaman spells), I want to find them so they can be fixed now instead of &quot;lol hotfix, we can't fix multistrike on ascendance so we buffed chain heal 0.5&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Easy there Internet Tough Guy. Do a little time in Game Q.A. and you'll realize that if a build is unplayable nothing gets done. That in mind, we actually are entitled to play Beta from the moment we get a key, as that's how we test the game for quality and bugs. Also since you seem unaware, Blizzard also has offices in Europe. One is in Versailles, France and another is in Cork, Ireland. <br />

<br />
Your second question makes a very good point, and should be directly asked to the devs. Since we used to get these points from the bosses/end of dungeons, we should get equivalent gold from the bosses/end of dungeons to compensate, otherwise we have to do additional farming/AH/crafting to make up for the need to buy gear off vendors this expansion that we would have bought with justice/valor.</div></div><hr />

Nice assumption there buddy, seems we're both good at that. Ret according to the latest sims isn't that great compared to other melee, I couldn't give a shit in the slightest about how &quot; good &quot; ret are in PvP which is what you seem to like, PvP can bugger right off for all I care.</div></div><hr />

Granted you can store up a lot more for PvP, but if you are just getting done with your Prideful gear, you won't have much left. /shrug Be happy any gold is free gold!</div></div><hr />
