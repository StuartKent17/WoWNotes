<br />
This is an approximate translation of the post. (Thank you Google!)<br />
Thank you for your support and patience!<br />
<br />
Beta testing will commence in the near future. (How soon? I can not disclose the exact date, I can only say ...... really very soon!) When 4.0 Beta launch, you will need an US client to connect to the beta servers. Players without the US client, you must first download the US version of World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
<br />
I would also like to remind you that there are many players who did not send their contact information to confirm their beta invitation. Please submit your information before June 23rd or your Beta invitation will be given to another player.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 3.3.5 deployed on US servers this week<br />
Patch 3.3.5 should be deployed on US realms this week (as usual, 99% sure, the patch might not go live if gnomes take over the world and shutdown the game). This is an US only release and the european realms will be updated next week.<br />
In patch 3.3.5, we will be introducing our new Battle.net system, which opens up new communication options for World of Warcraft players and lays the groundwork for integration with future Blizzard games, such as StarCraft II. In order to ensure that the implementation of this major new system goes as smoothly as possible, we plan to release the patch to North American realms first, with Europe, Korea, and the region of Taiwan following approximately one week afterward.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle.net Real ID<br />
The big feature of this patch is the addition of Battle.net to the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/june/battlenetrealid_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/june/battlenetrealid.jpg)<br />
<br />
One of our goals for the new Battle.net is to create the framework for an online gaming experience that is even more accessible, more engaging, and more entertaining than the previous Battle.net. Our new Real ID feature is an integral part of this effort, providing you with advanced ways for forming and maintaining meaningful relationships with your friends on the service.<br />
<br />
Real ID is a completely voluntary and optional level of identity that keeps players connected across all of Battle.net. When you and a friend mutually agree to become Real ID friends, you'll have access to a number of additional features that will enrich your social gaming experience in new and exciting ways.<br />
<br />
Read the Real ID FAQ (http://us.battle.net/realid/faq.html)for additional details.<br />
<br />
Real Names for Friends<br />
Your Real ID friends will appear under their real-life names on your friends list, alongside whatever characters they're playing. Gone are the days of having to remember which of your friends is which. You'll also see your friends' real names when chatting, communicating in-game, or viewing their character's profile.<br />
<br />
Cross-Game Chat<br />
With Real ID, friends can now chat cross-game, cross-realm, and cross-faction across all supported Blizzard games. In World of Warcraft and need more players for your Icecrown Citadel raid? You check your Real ID friends list to see if anyone's available, and sure enough, a couple of guildmates are playing a 2v2 ranked match in StarCraft II. Real ID makes it easy to ask them to come along.<br />
<br />
Rich Presence<br />
See additional information on your friends list about what your Real ID friends are up to. Find out what your friends are doing and which games and modes they're playing in real time. Invite that buddy just sitting around in Dalaran to play some StarCraft II with you without fear of interrupting a raid or a heated Wintergrasp match.<br />
<br />
Broadcasts<br />
Broadcast a short status message for all of your Real ID friends to see, whether you want to issue a call-to-arms or let your friends know about an important change of plans. You can also read your friends' broadcast messages on the &quot;Recent Broadcasts&quot; feed on the Battle.net welcome page -- kind of a &quot;corkboard&quot; to leave messages to your friends when offline or busy.<br />
<br />
Friend Once, See All Characters<br />
When you agree to become Real ID friends with another player, both of you will automatically see all the other's characters on your friends list. You'll even see any characters your friend creates in future Blizzard games, carrying your social network forward and helping you stay connected with the people you enjoy playing with most.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ruby Sanctum<br />
The Ruby Sanctum raid instance is also added to the game with this patch. The instance will not be available immediately and will most likely be unlocked after the deployment Patch 3.3.5 in all regions.<br />
Due to the fact that we will be delaying the release of patch 3.3.5 in Europe, Korea and Taiwan in order to ensure the patch process in all regions is as smooth as possible, the Ruby Sanctum will not immediately be available on North American realms upon the release of the patch. Once patch 3.3.5 has been released in North America and we are confident about a time when we can open up Ruby Sanctum, we will provide an update here on the forums.<br />

&lt;td style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; In the last phase of the fight, Halion opens portals to the Physical and Twilight realms and the raid has to split to fight him in both phases. He starts with 50% Corporeality, the % goes up and down depending on how much damage Halion takes in both realms, if you deal a lot of damage in the physical realm he will start dealing and taking less damage in the Twilight realm, and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />
<br />
The goal in this last phase of the fight is to balance the amount of DPS in both realms to make sure the Corporeality % stays between 40 and 60%.&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;/table&gt;<br />

Ruby Sanctum Questline<br />
A couple of quests will be added to the game to introduce the Ruby Sanctum. If you do not know who are the dragons mentioned in the quest descriptions, you might want to check the Dargonax (http://www.wowwiki.com/Dargonax) / Sinestra (http://www.wowwiki.com/Sinestra) articles on WoWWiki.<br />
<br />
Quest - Trouble at Wyrmrest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/26012/trouble-at-wyrmrest/)<br />
Objective - Speak with Krasus at Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight.<br />
Description<br />
My old friend Krasus sends word of dire happenings at Wyrmrest, in Dragonblight. His missive was brief, but it seems that there has been some sort of attack on the Ruby Sanctum beneath the Temple.<br />
<br />
Pressing business here in Dalaran keeps me from attending to the matter personally, but I have heard word of your exploits in the Lich King's Citadel and you are doubtless up to the task -- perhaps you could assist Krasus in my stead? <br />
<br />
Quest - Assault on the Sanctum (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/26013/assault-on-the-sanctum/)<br />
Objective - Investigate the Ruby Sanctum beneath Wyrmrest Temple.<br />
Description<br />
&lt;race&gt;, something terrible has transpired within the Ruby Sanctum beneath the Temple. The entry to the Sanctum is in ruins, and its guardians violently slain. We sent scouts to investigate, but they have not returned. I cannot help but fear the worst.<br />
<br />
Enter the Ruby Sanctum and discover what has befallen the home of my flight. Once we have more information, we can plan our next steps accordingly. <br />
<br />
Quest - The Twilight Destroyer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/26034/the-twilight-destroyer/)<br />
Objective - Defeat Halion and repel the invasion of the Ruby Sanctum.<br />
Rewards - Emblem of Frost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49426/emblem-of-frost/) x 5<br />
Description<br />
This was no reckless attack, but rather a carefully orchestrated strike against the heart of the Red Dragonflight. Zarithrian, on the bluff over there, is overseeing the assault, but the true leader of this force is a brash and powerful Twilight dragon named Halion. Not since Dargonax has a full-grown spawn of Sinestra's twisted experiments been seen.<br />
<br />
Slay him, &lt;name&gt;, and then when the invasion has been fully repelled, report to Krasus regarding all you have seen here. <br />
<br />
<br />
Transcripts<br />
Last but not least, here is a transcript of the dialogue with Xerestrasza of the Red Dragonflight.<br />
<br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Yell01.wav - Help! I am trapped within this tree! I require aid!<br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Yell02.wav - Thank you! I could have not held out for much longer. A terrible thing has happened here.<br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say01.wav - We believed that the Sanctum was well fortified, but we were not prepareted for the nature of this assault. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say02.wav - The Black Dragonkin materialized from thin air, and set upon us before we could react. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say03.wav - We did not stand a chance. As my brethren perished around me, I managed to retreat hear and bar the entrance. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say04.wav - They slaughtered us with cold efficiency, but the true focus of their interest seemed to be the eggs kept here in the sanctum. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say05.wav - The commander of the forces on the ground here is a cruel brute named Zarithrian. But I fear there are greater powers at work. <br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say06.wav - In their initial assault I caught a glimpse of their true leader, a fearsome full-grown Twilight Dragon.<br />
RS_Xerestrasza_Say07.wav - I know not the extent of their plans heroes, but I know this: they cannot be allowed to succeed!<br />
<br />
Halion also has a couple of interesting lines. <br />
<br />
RS_Halion_Aggro01.wav - Your world teeters on the brink of annihilation. You will all bear witness to the coming of a new age of destruction!<br />
RS_Halion_Beserk01.wav - Not good enough!<br />
RS_Halion_Death01.wav - Relish this victory mortals, for it will be your last. This world will burn with the Master's return!<br />
RS_Halion_Phase2.wav - You will find only suffering within the realm of Twilight. Enter if you dare. <br />
RS_Halion_Phase3.wav - I am the light AND the darkness! Cower mortals before the Herald of Deathwing!<br />
RS_Halion_Slay01.wav - Another hero falls.<br />
RS_Halion_Slay02.wav - Ha Ha Ha!<br />
RS_Halion_Spawn01.wav - Meddlesome insects, you're too late! The Ruby Sanctum is lost.<br />
RS_Halion_Special01.wav - The heavens burn!<br />
RS_Halion_Special02.wav - Beware the shadow! <br />
<br />

Assault on the Ruby Sanctum<br />
For ages the red dragonflight and its noble matriarch, Alexstrasza the Life-Binder, have dedicated themselves to preserving all life on Azeroth. Recently, the very heart of this virtuous dragonflight has come under threat.<br />
<br />
An eerie silence has settled over the Ruby Sanctum, the red dragonflight's sacred lair within the Chamber of the Aspects. This troubling development has led to fears that the sanctum, home to Azeroth's largest clutch of red dragon eggs, has been breached by an unknown, sinister force. If these claims are true and immediate action is not taken, the benevolent red dragonflight might be crippled forever.<br />

Real ID: A New Way to Connect With Your Friends on Battle.net<br />
One of our goals for the new Battle.net is to create the framework for an online gaming experience that is even more accessible, more engaging, and more entertaining than the previous Battle.net. The newly released Real ID feature, available to World of Warcraft players as part of patch 3.3.5, is an integral part of this effort, providing you with advanced ways for forming and maintaining meaningful relationships with your friends on the service.<br />
<br />
Real ID is a completely voluntary and optional level of identity that keeps players connected across all of Battle.net. When you and a friend mutually agree to become Real ID friends, you'll have access to a number of additional features that will enrich your social gaming experience in new and exciting ways. Go here (http://us.battle.net/realid/?rhtml=y) for more details.<br />
<br />
General<br />
The Ruby Sanctum, an all-new 10- and 25-player raid dungeon featuring normal and Heroic difficulties, has been added! Players will find the dungeon entrance below Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight. Please note due to the way this patch is being applied in all regions, this dungeon will not immediately be available in North America. Stay tuned to our General Discussion forum for an official announcement on the opening of the Ruby Sanctum.<br />
The functionality of the Vote Kick feature in the Dungeon Finder will now behave differently according to a player's history with the system. Players using the Dungeon Finder who rarely vote to kick players from a group, or rarely abandon groups before a dungeon is complete, will find that the Vote Kick option will have no cooldown. For players who frequently abandon groups or vote to kick other players, the Vote Kick option will be kept on a cooldown. This functionality will adjust itself as a player's behavior while using the Dungeon Finder changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
Chat Frame<br />
Players can now right-click on any chat type (Whisper, Trade, General, Party, Raid, etc.) and choose to move conversation types into separate windows. This will move that chat type to a separate tab in the Chat frame which can be undocked and moved anywhere on the screen.<br />
Using the Move to Whisper Window option on a Whisper will place the conversation with that player in a separate tab.<br />
Any time a conversation with another player is put into its own tab, the tab will glow when a new message is received.<br />
<br />
Hovering over the Chat Frame and using the mouse wheel will allow players to scroll through chat text.<br />
Players can select Classic Mode under Interface Options to keep the Chat Frame functionality closer to what it was prior to patch 3.3.5.<br />
The Simple Chat User Interface option has been removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Friends List<br />
A new icon has been added to the top left of the Chat Frame which will open up the Friends list.<br />
In addition to its current functionality, the Friends List will now allow players to add Battle.net accounts (Real ID). Players will have to confirm that they are friends in order for a Real ID to be added. Once Real ID friends, players can communicate cross-game, cross-faction and cross-realm.<br />
A new Pending tab has been added where players can accept or decline a Real ID friend request, or select the Report Spam or Block Communications buttons.<br />
Players can now select from three statuses which will be visible to their friends: Available, Away and Busy.<br />
A Broadcast window has been added to the top of the frame. Players can use this to broadcast a message to all of their Real ID friends online. This message will also be displayed under the broadcaster's Real ID information in each friend's list.<br />

AVR Mod Broken in 3.3.5<br />
This is a notice that we’re making changes in 3.3.5 in attempts to break the ability for the AVR (Augmented Virtual Reality) mod to continue functioning. For those unaware, this mod allows players to draw in the 3D space of the game world, which can then be shared with others who are also using the mod. In some cases this manifests itself through drawing/tagging/defacing the game world, but more popularly is used to give visual guides for dungeon and raid encounters.<br />
<br />
We’re making this change for two reasons. The invasive nature of a mod altering and/or interacting with the game world (virtually or directly) is not intended and not something we will allow. World of Warcraft UI addons are never intended to interact with the game world itself. This is mirrored in our stance and restriction of model and texture alterations. The second reason is that it removes too much player reaction and decision-making while facing dungeon and raid encounters. While some other mods also work to this end, we find that AVR and the act of visualizing strategy within the game world simply goes beyond what we’re willing to allow.<br />
<br />
The change we’re making in attempts to break the functionality is light in its touch and approach. When blocking any functionality we run the risk of affecting other mods, but we’ve targeted the changes as carefully as possible. If we find that the AVR mod (or any mod attempting to replicate its functions) are usable after 3.3.5 we will take further, more drastic steps. <br />
<br />
If you do not remember what AVR is, here is a small reminder.<br />
<br />

So one player should be able to stand and auto-hit and doing 1k DPS on a boss and then when they hit enrage it was everyones fault? Damage meters are a good tool to see that people dont slack, and the only thing that makes DPS fun.</div></div><hr />

It's funny to me how WoW players are excited at the prospect of RealID and SC2 players are really really upset about it.<br />
<br />
The reason is simple: Majority of SC2 players are gamers while the majority of WoW players are not. Most people who &quot;play&quot; WoW treat it as some kind of merge between an interactive story book, Sims and Second Life.</div></div><hr />

Man, it's great that you know all about that SC2 playerbase before it even exists. If you're going to troll, at least make a better front. You whinewhinewhine in every single thread I see you in and it's quite tiresome. If you're so unhappy just quit and save us all from the earaches/eyesores, or at least figure out how to construct a credible argument.</div></div><hr />

While a very awesome video, Battlenet 2.0 seems to really be good for WoW players than SC2 players. The anger for Bnet 2.0 SCII exists, and in great numbers by turning its interface into a console format. If you're a casual, it's perfectly fine, but it's slowly &quot;destroying&quot; what SCII stands for.<br />

Being in the SC2 beta myself I can say the biggest problem with SC2 right now is that people think there will be no chats in the retail version. The other thing SC2 players are upset about is that a US player cannot play with an EU player unless they buy another copy of SC2 aand also that there is no LAN. My own opinion of B.net 2.0 is that it's a great concept. It's definitely good because it connects players from all of the multi gaming platforms from SC2 to WoW to Diablo. With Blizzard possibly implementing Cross-realm raids in the future I can see this being very beneficial.</div></div><hr />

You obviously have no idea why they are implementing this, once they merge all the battle-groups you will be able to group with friends cross server to do your randoms which I am 100% glad they finally did. What kind of privacy do you need besides ditching raids and avoiding guild members? This is for people IRL that you are good friends with or people in game you made good friends with.

Not necessarily. Beta doesn't have to be available to everyone in all regions at the same time. In fact, I don't think it ever has been. Beta was on a different timeline in Europe (started later, ended later and the game released later) for Wrath, iirc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mine is currently listed as my sister's name, as it was her card being used to pay for the game, and she wanted all the info on the account to match her credit card, so there would be no issues if WoW decided to double charge like it did before in the past.<br />
<br />
Now, if I return, I shall be known as Stephanie, instead of my actual name -.-<br />
<br />
Now, I COULD for all intensive purposes, Buy a new WoW game, BC, WotLK, then buy Cataclysm, THEN transfer all 10 of my toons to said account, as the name on my actual account is correct, it's the battle.net that's in my sisters -.-; (Unless they changed this too), but that'd cost me like, $200 to do, which is not happening.<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone comes out with an addon to change the name displayed by Real ID :S</div></div><hr />

I think that all the thing you wrote are really good, Blizz should really do something to improve account's security<br />
Putting authenticators in the game's boxes would be a realy good thing, i have some friend that would like to buy them but they don't because they don't trust in online transactions....<br />
Also the second thing you wrote is really good and also if wouldn't stop hackers from selling all items and/or maiing golds it would reduce the problem that being hacked would cause. and the secret phrase double authenticated (via email and website) thing should be used also when you add an authenticator to you account, that is the first thing that hackers do when they ahck you account...</div></div><hr />

Hope they get rid of DMG meters, or atleast make it so you can only see your own dps.<br />

It should be about the group getting progress and doind well overally, not about you and your ego being first on damage.<br />

Yay for closed minded people. Being able to tell who's causing a wipe or *why* a wipe is being caused is more important then your annoyance with dps meters. Did our tank just die from not being healed for 24 seconds? Recount can tell you. Did that dps just pull 1k dps on Marrowgar... <br />

<br />
Hacking cannot be 100% stopped if 1 person decides that they want to hack. No matter how extensive the steps Blizzard takes it's impossible to stop it completely while people want to do it. No matter how complex the log in process is it becomes, at it's most basic form, information sent from 1 computer to another; this information can be:<br />
* stolen when it's being sent by your computer to Blizzard's (on any website, or when logging in or out)<br />
* stolen when it's being sent by Blizzard's to your computer (on any website, or when logging in or out)<br />
* decrypted no matter how secure it is (because your computer and Blizzard's computers need to be able to decrypt it)<br />
<br />
Force password expirations doesn't help. It gives people who already have access to your computer another opportunity to steal your account details or create a new password when you're trying to update your expired one<br />
Server / Realm / Faction transfers without secret phrase double authentication can be cracked. Not good enough.<br />
I'd rather have that GM helping to try and make it harder for hackers than sitting in /2 personally.<br />
<br />
I've been hacked. I contacted Blizzard and within an hour had my account back with all the stolen items at the mailbox waiting for me.<br />
<br />
TL : DR version: No data is 100% secure on the Internet. Nothing. The only way to 100% prevent access to your computer is to not have it connected to the Internet.</div></div><hr />

Personally I think all the &quot;99.99% of all the cases are the persons fault, and there are no other possibility&quot; responses are getting really old.<br />
<br />
I fully agree the majority, probably even vast majority of cases are the user's fault, they did/didn't do something as you said above; that said, there are a large number of cases where that could not have happened.<br />
<br />
I am in a casual guild, raided a fair bit awhile ago but then everyone but a few have taken breaks from WoW, now pretty much everyone but my fiance and I, plus a couple others have gotten hacked, the guild leader one of our friends has had to put in numerous petitions to get things restored from people who have not been active or logged in for months, to even half a year in one case that were hacked.<br />
<br />
These are people who haven't even been on wow in long amounts of time to do any of the stuff above except for falling for a phising email, which most are not dumb enough to do, and one or two haven't even had internet anymore for awhile before they were hacked, so they couldn't have done anything to cause it regardless.<br />
<br />
So yes, in the vast majority of cases I agree the user's need to take more precautions about their account security, but there is definitely still the need for things to be looked into from Blizzard and not just endless &quot;its all your/their fault not anything else&quot; attitude.</div></div><hr />

WTF? Sorry to sound impatient, and I know it is patch day, but is this a relatively minor patch or a full xpac!? 10 hours downtime now! 6am to 4pm EST downtime. And why do they friggin do it long after the west coast goes to bed (normally) and just as the east coast wakes up? &quot;Normal&quot; maintenance is 8am to 1pm EST. IMO it should start at 2am or 3am PST. They keep sayin that cata is the biggest xpac they have ever taken on. I want to play worgen, but do not want the 12+ hrs of downtime one or two maintenance's before the release. It seems that after cata, they can work on a process to shorten maintenance, or change to bi-weekly maintenance. They've gone two weeks before, why not regularly?<br />

After checking the official forums, the armory, and Blizz's website the only thing that is down is Bnet. Which means the this Real Id crap is whats causing the extended maintenance. People should realize that even if it doesn't show your e-mail address, it does show your real name. With your real name, a little time, and the right software anyone can find out where you live, phone number, and pretty much anything else they want. IF you doubt me ask anyone who has had the ID stolen or been stalked and see how it was done. WOW is a virtual game and everything in it is virtual and that should be the way it is kept. Adding real life stuff is just going to cause problems in the long run. For example say Real ID goes down and takes Bnet with it then no matter what game your playing if it uses Bnet for log in your screwed and we all know how dependable blizzard's servers are. If this is suppose to be opt in then you should only be able to do it from Bnet not from in game and the default settings should be off.</div></div><hr />

Oh, you mean facebook with avatars and axes? Nice. Just what the world needs is a social networking site. If I wanted that I would play Second (-to-no) Life. Next we will see in-game advertising... oh wait... Lil' KT and Celestial Steed. Right, already got that. Then we will see unauthorized in-game communications for applications (bots) connecting to the service... wait, got that too. effin gold farmers and hackers. <br />
<br />
Well gee, the only thing left to do then is to rebrand it, World of Facebook TM &quot;Screw the Chinese, now with Pandaren goodness!&quot;</div></div><hr />

I pay for my subscription, and work full time, Tuesdays being a day I am able to play. It bugs me to see that I can go do something, and come back when they say maintenance will be done, and then see it extended two hours. They need to change it to say &quot;Maintenance day, expect 24 hour down time, if we come up early, it will be posted.&quot; If we expected it to be all day and it only took 12 hours, most of us would be a lot happier than expecting to get on a 11 only to be told, check back in 2 hours, only to once again be told to check back in two hours. This better not be another Ulduar patch day where whole continents go offline randomly after servers come up. It's already shaping up to be.<br />

You must be really new to WoW. Despite of what the ToS says, Blizzard has credited customers with things like a free day before due to very long maintenance. They don't have to do it but they also don't want to piss everyone off too much so they do it to be nice to us.</div></div><hr />

Nope, been playing since the servers opened in 2004, and still play despite days where I can't play due to the server being down for maintenance or patches. You're right, they don't have to give us a day's credit when the servers are down for patches, but it's because they do that people piss and moan when they don't.</div></div><hr />

Hope they get rid of DMG meters, or atleast make it so you can only see your own dps.<br />

It should be about the group getting progress and doind well overally, not about you and your ego being first on damage.<br />

They're patching Ruby Sanctum as well, genius.<br />
<br />
As much as Blizzard fucking sucks at patching, what's more maddening is that they said it would be up at 11am. Is it that hard to just say 3pm and go from there? I would bet a lot of money that there are thousands of people who have been sitting at their computers trying to log in every five minutes since 10:30 am. They would avoid so much grief on the consumers' part as well as save them a few updates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ruby Sanctum isn't going to be activated this week.<br />
<br />
As for the pre-Cata events, those are there, but won't be activated either.<br />
<br />
Hence...chat features.<br />
RealID goes beyond being a simple chat feature, imo. It's cross-realm and cross-faction...I'm sure it's slightly more difficult to implement on live servers than the changes to the chat box UI. Ruby Sanctum may not be activated this week, but it still needs to be patched and put into the game. New instances always take time to patch whenever they do it. Pre-Cata resources may not be activated, but again they take time to patch in and get put into place.<br />
<br />
Patience.</div></div><hr />

He's not trolling, It does not matter if the raid or the events are not activated, they are still being patched into the game. If they were not patched, they couldn't instantly activate them later, because they wouldn't be in the game. If anyone here is trolling, it would be you right now...</div></div><hr />

I bet you 100 bucks when they &quot;activate&quot; RS we see more downtime for bugs in RS. You can't possibly know the bugs in RS if its not activated.</div></div><hr />

Should be<br />

Dude come on, have you ever considered that English may not be their primary language,my guess is no. Stop being a !&amp;$&amp; &amp;*!*,(Sorry could not Understand rest).<br />

Therefore, we assume that you are a young kid with the username nz4life, and usually people that rage in English saying their primary language isn't English is usually a liar.</div></div><hr />

I don't see why they wouldn't let you do it. They are already letting you create characters of both factions in a same PvP realm.</div></div><hr />

I'm fine with it if it means they're fixing known/reported stability issues at the same time they're doing this--I've had my game crash and burn or lag and D/C without warning for the last month and a half even after reinstalling five times (which of course includes roughly 8 hours of repatching and re-applying Add-Ons &gt;.&gt;;).<br />

<br />
My guess would be the system uses UNIX time which counts milliseconds since January 1, 1970, which was a little over 40.5 years ago. I guess there was a bug where it didn't subtract a 2nd time to get a time elapsed.</div></div><hr />

Oh the irony.<br />
<br />
I bet you 100 bucks when they &quot;activate&quot; RS we see more downtime for bugs in RS. You can't possibly know the bugs in RS if its not activated. There were few if any bugs in ToC. IIRC all five bosses were patched in the same week, just opened sequentially. Note: I don't remember any content patches - the period is glossed over in my mind because of how much I hated the instance.</div></div><hr />
