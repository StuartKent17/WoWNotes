After posting the Tier 11 Stats a few days ago I realized that I didn't do any proper preview of the existing Tier 11 models, time to fix that! This preview isn't official, stuff might be slightly wrong (Gloves and Boots might have a slightly different model, I can't really check that) but it should give you a good idea of what to expect on live servers.  
 
 
 
I also included the Warrior's helm, the rest of the set is still missing.

<br />
I also included the Warrior's helm, the rest of the set is still missing.<br />
Sets for other classes aren't available yet.<br />
One of the recolor of the Rogue set is bugged on males. <br />
I included both Pants and Robe version of the Druid set, you should just assume that the actual set will use the robe model. (They always add pants models just in case)<br />

<br />
Sounds like the next Indiana Jones movies.<br />
<br />
I like the first 2 druid colors though the 3rd one looks rather priestish. I also like the shoulders of the rogue gear but wtf is up with the helms on both of these classes gear? Warlocks can be somewhat excused because they are obviously going for the cultist look.</div></div><hr />

But, the other sets... wings and all... Are all those made for 10 years old (maybe BY 10yo -_- ) ?<br />
I would be ashamed to wear that... I think it has a lot to do with a colorblind designer (he must be), because some color choice are weird. Well, the blue (bioman) druid female is not THAT bad, and the wings is more fit for woman than men (am i not pretty with my dress and white wings ? is this the gay parade ?) ^^</div></div><hr />

Rogues become djinnis for now as I can see, not a good choice for them imo.<br />
Warlock set's helm is still ugly. It would be better if it wouldnt show any part of the character's face.<br />
And warrior's helm is cool. No, really.</div></div><hr />

Beat me to the &quot;molting&quot; joke. :)<br />
I think the falling feathers give it a pretty cool/unique effect. Definitely my favorite so far.<br />

The druid set looks pretty sweet,i hope they will change the floaty feathers to match the color of the set. The warlock set is nothing special,its not ugly,but its not exactly 'whoa' either.<br />
I agree that the molting alone would've been enough fluff for the druid set,lightning belongs to shammies. *curious for the shammy set now*<br />
The warrior helmet looks 'meh',looks like its going to be a pretty boring set,its not hard to stuff some crystals on a piece of plate and the color is abit too ..paladin-y :p</div></div><hr />

They're priests, not angels. Anyway looks like my druid's becoming my main with the tier 11 looking that cool, female gear looks a lot better too I'm happy my druid's a chick. <br />
<br />
Rogue gear's, eh, okay I guess. I don't like how much the face shows through the helm, makes it look like a really sad fat ghost. If it wasn't for that I think the idea could be cool, like sort of a Hashashin / mummy look.<br />
<br />
Warrior helm looks amazing, but from the look of it you can tell that the rest of the gear will probably look a bit silly.<br />

Rogues getting another flashy set, i can imagine trying to hide in the shadows with our hads burning....<br />

<br />
There hasn't been a true-druid set since the t6 bird set, but THIS druid set (a bird set) looks like a priest set? I'm guessing your reasoning being because of the wings, the wings that make it a bird set. However if your reasoning is that it looks like a priest set because of the color, I must preemptively retort with; what you've never seen a blue jay?</div></div><hr />

Lock - actually I love the warlock set. The helm looks like an executioner's helm, and there is nothing wrong with not being symmetric in a class that is supposed to be evil/insane.<br />
Rogue - rogues look like djinns which I think is an interesting approach. Slightly sparkly, but the shoulder/helm vapour effect is damn nice.<br />
Warrior Helm - looks good, just not in that color. Earth brownish would be pretty damn cool. And yes, it does remind me of T2 rhino helm.</div></div><hr />

What is exactly wrong with the tier sets? The warlock one looks awfully Twilight Cultist looking, which fits the theme of the class, the rogue look fits perfectly in the Uldum environment, the only thing about the druid set are the colors, they're very blue and white, when you think of druids you think of greens and browns, it's more shamanistic colors than druid.<br />
<br />
As for being a human... lol sorry, but they do offer a race change option. ;P</div></div><hr />

I dont like the rogue set. The shoulders looks nice, but those blue fire effects must be lowered. Actually all flashy effects in the t11 sets so far must be lowered :D<br />

I expect that Blizzard will not make sets that look awful, primitive, made by noones. Ask one of their top modellers, whether they would write down their names next to these T11 sets. I don't really think so they will. There are fanboys who say awesome to everything whats coming towards them (wiki check: Cognitive dissonance) and there are ppl, who want to see normal looking sets and can't be fed with SHIT. Most of the people play WoW because you can own beautiful looking - virtual - things. No matter what I don't care if its called dungeon set, Tier X, or Muhammad &quot;I'm hard&quot; Bruce Lee, I WANT TO SEE GOOD LOOKIN, THEN AWESOME LOOKING, AND AT LAST UBER MUDAFAKABITCH LOOKIN SETS __ALL THE TIME__.

I agree that the molting alone would've been enough fluff for the druid set,lightning belongs to shammies. *curious for the shammy set now*<br />
The warrior helmet looks 'meh',looks like its going to be a pretty boring set,its not hard to stuff some crystals on a piece of plate and the color is abit too ..paladin-y :p<br />

Sorry but its not hard to figure out that this model will only be used for T11 and possible offset pieces. They ALWAYS do that its nothing new.<br />
They work with different departments. Art department, Item itemization department, Dungeon design department, ect.<br />
<br />
They also use the skins to put gear on NPC's ect. Do not forget the heroic pieces use different colors and so on..<br />
<br />
tldr; They always create 4 color pallets but that does not mean they will use them all.</div></div><hr />

You're one of those cool kids, I suppose. You know, the ones who complains all the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
No apparently he is one of those kids that tells the truth, and doesn't give blizz fellatio for handing them crap. If you are really that impressed by this then fine, but I'm not and I don't see how anyone could be. I think blizzards artist have pushed about as far as they possibly can. Time to bring in some fresh minds, or change some things.<br />
<br />
I understand that after years of designing different versions of armor for different classes, and each new one having to be just that much more over the top, that you are going to reach a point you just can't advance past. Maybe instead of blizz being dick heads they could let th eplayer decide about looks. I know they said they wouldn't ever do that, but it would be great if I could just transfer the stats to an item I already have. That way if I'm a fan of a certain tier I could just use that. They could still create new art, but it could be generic plate, mail, leather, cloth instead of whole new sets for every class.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone who is complaining go draw up an armor set then model it in 3DS max without going over 5000 poly count then come back post them here and then we will talk. <br />
<br />
Someone's panties are in a bunch. Does remind me about some saying about can't take criticism why the hell are you doing it in public.. something along those lines.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Charo</div><div class="date">2010-09-29, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I expect that Blizzard will not make sets that look awful, primitive, made by noones. Ask one of their top modellers, whether they would write down their names next to these T11 sets. I don't really think so they will. There are fanboys who say awesome to everything whats coming towards them (wiki check: Cognitive dissonance) and there are ppl, who want to see normal looking sets and can't be fed with SHIT. Most of the people play WoW because you can own beautiful looking - virtual - things. No matter what I don't care if its called dungeon set, Tier X, or Muhammad &quot;I'm hard&quot; Bruce Lee, I WANT TO SEE GOOD LOOKIN, THEN AWESOME LOOKING, AND AT LAST UBER MUDAFAKABITCH LOOKIN SETS __ALL THE TIME__. I don't wanna look like a clown, a beggar, a fuckin nobody, because these are the first tier sets in Cata. If you like shit, eat it, I won't.<br />
<br />
So, let me paraphrase:<br />
<br />
Hello, I am a 15 year old male who is obviously too cool to be seen wearing any of this &quot;high fantasy&quot; armor, I care more about what other people think about my avatar than I do about my real life appearance, which btw is rad, because I wear band and anime T's and and skin tight jeans. Blah Blah Blah.<br />

Thay add pants model because if you do not have tier robe (chest) and/or wear some other that does not cover legs you won't be with ur undearwear... also sometimes sets have &quot;kilt&quot; as pants then they do not do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish you'd show me a human druid. The only reason they're used is because a couple people think armor is best displayed on them, but that's not the case at all, especially on human males which tend to &quot;stretch&quot; textures all the time diminishing the quality. I liked when Boub used Belfs instead, as the gear didn't suffer from stretching, and of course their model is newer-and thus much better than human models, which is probably the worst model in the game.<br />

Its not that, people don't understand how much effort actually goes into making something in 3D space let alone actually designing the armor from the front side and back in 2D first to use as a reference.

<br />
Mostly all College courses dealing with 3D character design are 2-3 years as an FYI. You spend the first year learning to do it, and the rest is refining your skills. However you can learn it on your own and still get a good job in the industry as long as you have the skills. You also don't realize that the people who model them just model them and have no say in the look. Concept artists draw the armor, the modelers make it 3D and the texture artists color it. Now I know they may not be the greatest models in the universe. However I have seen much much worse in many games, you have to take into consideration that every tier set will reflect the expansion it was released in as well which means some could end up ugly depending on what they are reflecting.</div></div><hr />

At this time any bosses a player defeats that are level-appropriate to them (and previously awarded badges or emblems upon defeat) will award them with the new Justice Points. Similarly, any items that previously cost emblems or badges of any type will now cost Justice Points instead.<br />

11.58 justice points for 1 frost emblem? They gotta be kidding me?! :O<br />
<br />
This makes items cost the same. The Tier legs are 1100 pts/11.58 = 95. That means if you had 95 frost, it will convert to the 1100 points it takes to buy Tier legs. The only thing is Triumph will also be the same, so if you have an alt, they can get the gear faster, but by now who cares anymore</div></div><hr />

<br />
... lets see druid t11 on worgen!!<br />
<br />
Actually, given that Worgen have a human form, and can be Druids, it's no longer completely stupid to model Druid armor on humans. Damn. I was kind of thinking the same as the first post I quoted till I hit the second and went... &quot;hmmm...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Rogue set is clearly modeled on a combination of Ethereals and an &quot;Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves&quot; type Rogue. Remember, (please, try to remember) that Rogues are not exclusively meant to be Ninjas. Combat spec is intended to be a swashbuckler type character, and combine that with a Middle Eastern theme to get something like the tier gear. I don't entirely *like* the set, I must admit, but I see where they're going and it's neither bad nor really out of character. <br />
<br />
On the topic of modeling, JokerJesus I gotta say it's nice to finally run into someone else who's worked in this industry and understands what all of this takes to produce. I've worked more on the code and systems side of things, but I've seen what the modelers have to do, and I'm amazed at the number of detailed models Blizzard puts out on a regular basis (No, I didn't work in games, I worked in scientific simulation visualization, but there's a large overlap). I'm always amazed at the number of people on these forums who:<br />
<br />
1) Think that Blizzard can just wave their collective hands (or throw money around) and come out with awesome, and<br />
2) Think that they don't do simply because they don't like us enough, are working on something else, or just thinkit's fun to produce crap.<br />
<br />
Come on guys. There are literally *thousands* of armor models in the game right now. How easy do you think it is to come up with a model that:<br />
<br />
1) Looks good<br />
2) Fits the theme of the expansion<br />
3) Doesn't look like something already in the game<br />
4) Fits into the limited polygon budget for character models?<br />
<br />
If you said &quot;easy&quot;, or &quot;Yeah but Blizz has a ton of money&quot; you're either wrong or missing the point respectively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know you are being funny, but it is simple. T10 legs (for example) cost 95 emblems now. On the PTR they cost 1,100 Justice points.<br />
<br />
1,100/95=11.5789 or rounded 11.58. This way you have the same cost to buy gear as you do now. Before this change the current 95 Frost legs took 400 emblems to convert to buy the same gear. <br />
<br />
The big difference is the Triumph now converts at the same rate, so if you have a ton of both, dump your frost and sell PS while you can. Post patch they will be like frozen orbs</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bright wings, like angel wings, for the Druids and not the Priests? Lame, annoying, and leading to a dissappointing Priest tier.<br />
<br />
The Rogues look like Gnomes with giant bushy Hitler moustaches. .....whhhaa? Terrible.<br />
<br />
And yay, more helms with giant phalluses on them...wooo... My Warrior will be so happy. Almost as happy as my Priest-wannabe Druid and my Murloc Huntard and then my Hitler Rogue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druid set: looks awesome, very druid-y. It looks like a priest set because of the wings? Come on! It's a BIRD set, which isn't even the first time for druids. They've already gotten enough plant-themed sets in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Rogue set: very much Arabian Nights-style, reminds me of both genies and ethereals. Nice.<br />
<br />
Warlock set: you can't deny that it looks very evil, which it is supposed to, being a warlock set and all that.<br />
<br />
Warrior helmet: not too bad, but I won't give my final opinion until I see the full set.<br />
<br />

Blizzard said one of the reasons for removing tree form as we know it was to enable druids to flaunt their armour, however I wouldn't want to show this off.<br />
<br />
That said, I like the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; theme of the rogue sets, and the dark theme that the warlock sets have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldriss</div><div class="date">2010-09-29, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">warrior helm=BA...but not so sure about the coloring of the druid sets. also the falling feathers are REALLY annoying. rogue set is good except it looks like his head is on fire, need to decrease that effect. warlock let looks good except the fece of the helm, i like the horns but the area below the eyes is uneven and bugs me every time i see it</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mister K</div><div class="date">2010-09-29, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are forgetting that the sets are based on &quot;elemental&quot; looks since its Cataclysm everything needs to feal fresh, warm and elemental like.<br />
Those sets are amazing and whoever thinks otherwise are totally clueless.<br />
<br />
Only change i would do is reduce the amount of leafs that drop from the druids shoulders and spice up the warlock armor. <br />
<br />
Apart from that good job, the setting is good and suits the new expansion well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Who ever thinks it looks terrible, go and you make a TIER set...</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a reason I wear my Feralheart or Thunderheart during downtime breaks :D<br />
<br />
Rogue set is okay, warlock set is weird, but then again, warlock sets always look weird to me. Don't ask.</div></div><hr />

Its multiple stages, and I have done it many times myself. I guarantee most people don't have a clue the time it takes to do this stuff.<br />
<br />
KK. Then they shouldn't approve of hideous and elementary art to design into the game in the first place then. GG.<br />

That's what I said before. The human model is the worst in the game, and it dilutes/stretches out the textures. The human proportions are just laughable. At best.</div></div><hr />

ehm i could? id swear if i got 1 day to stand behind help them make tier and i would help them make such awsome set for all classes that well yeah you would get my point how damn bad the designers and animators are.<br />
<br />
These are really bad and synergize 0 and are really bad designed they could become great with some big revamps with same look but however they dont got the look they should have in its design.<br />
<br />
So yes pls get me a week behind an animator to tell them what to do and you would understand my point, the design and fantasy behind them are so bad it hurts my eyes.<br />
<br />
And also i bet they got really well salory from their work, And that with all due respect would expect you to design it better, Way better but anyway im going to go Game asembly accadamy to learn to make games and design them. so dont be suprised if you see me on a good and big company making great stuff from 7 years from now.</div></div><hr />

Protect the hive... bzzz... protect the hive!<br />
<br />
What a tired, lame retort already. &quot;Lets see you do better&quot;. I'm not getting paid salary to design stuff, I didn't go to art school, these people did. They were hired from showing off portfolios of work, I'd expect better from an educated paid professional. Oh, you know, kinda like how everything in TBC looked awesome, declined in Wrath, and what we've seen so far is laughable at best.</div></div><hr />
