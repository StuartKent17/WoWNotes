Twitter Q&amp;A - LVL 71 to 80 XP decreased in Patch 4.3<br />
Blizzard did a small Q&amp;A session on Twitter and confirmed, among other things, that the XP required to level from level 71 to 80 would be reduced in Patch 4.3<br />
Q: Are you considering making any changes to the time it will take to level to cap for newbie players after the next expansion?<br />
A: We'll be decreasing the experience needed for levels 71-80 in patch 4.3. That's all I have for now.<br />
<br />
Q: Will we see more &quot;intro raids&quot; like Naxx10 in Wrath?<br />
A: Raid Finder is being designed to offer a similar experience.<br />
<br />
Q: Any chance for a less steep learning curve in the game? I mean players hit a brick wall at 85, make previous content harder.<br />
A: If anything, you'll see more variable endgame content in the future to allow players additional progression paths. <br />
<br />
Q: Will any of the new Darkmoon Faire stuff be accessible at all times, or will it all be contained within that one week?<br />
A: The updated 4.3 Darkmoon Faire is likely to be available the first week of every month for both factions.<br />
<br />
Q: Will there be a &quot;random raid&quot; component to the Raid Finder letting us enter raids we've been previously saved to, like LFG &amp; Trolls?<br />
A: Raid locks will likely work like LFG under Raid Finder, though details of the system (coming soon) will better explain why.<br />
<br />
Q: Any chance we'll possibly have a chance to get an old quest item or two restored for transmogrification once it comes out?<br />
A: If there are really popular item looks, we'll consider adding new ways to obtain them.<br />
<br />
Q: Will disc priests be getting their bubble graphic changed for DA &quot;soon&quot;, is this still happening? <br />
A: Last time we spoke with the class design team, they said the Divine Aegis effect will likely change in 4.3.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the Raid Finder allow access to lower raids?<br />
A: Probably not for 4.3, but it's something we'd like to do.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the 4.3 Raid finder allow me to group with my cross-realm friends?<br />
A: Hard to say at this stage in development.<br />

Battleground Win Ratios<br />
Player feedback is an essential part of our development process, but this kind of thread helps illustrate the value and the pitfalls of anecdotal feedback.<br />
<br />
What makes it useful? It's personal and emotional. It tells us about what it feels like to play World of Warcraft from an individual's perspective, where the big picture might seem pretty remote and unimportant.<br />
<br />
The pitfall? It's personal and emotional, which is good, but very subjective. It's a tiny (though important) sample when compared against the whole of every battleground game happening everywhere. We have a duty to objectively look at the big picture. For example, our stats tell us that the ratios for various battlegrounds are pretty close to 50% win/loss for each faction, though that might not matter much to you when you're in the heat of the action.<br />
<br />
So, when we're looking at what a quest feels like anecdotally, if it's too frustrating, then we can probably adjust that. When it comes to a system like the Battlegrounds, where the dynamic is almost exclusively player driven, but is working really well, it's not a good idea to mess with it because the big picture looks great. <br />
<br />
Speaking personally, I've found that my mindset plays a huge role in how much fun I'm having. In the midst of a losing streak, I try to remember my winning streaks and landslide wins, or I adopt a philosophical approach and do what I can, where I can. If I get too frustrated, I do a different, more relaxing in-game activity for awhile or step away entirely. My bottom line is that how I think and feel about what I'm doing in-game can mean the difference between having a great time (even if I'm on a losing team), and table-flipping frustration.<br />
<br />
As we've said elsewhere, battlegrounds require a ton of effort to create, and modifying them even slightly is extremely labor intensive. It will probably be more worthwhile to create new and better battlegrounds in the future, than go back to continually tweak and modify the old ones. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3082081570?page=3#56))<br />
<br />
New Character Models<br />
Updating existing character models isn't something we've been &quot;waffling on.&quot; It's something we'd love to do, but the fact is the art team has finite resources. Updating the current playable race models to be more in-line with worgen and goblins requires much more than just increasing the poly count. There are more bone structures on the frames of newer models which allow for more animation options. In order to update older models, the wire frames have to change, which means a large number of existing animations and customizations/hairstyles would have to change.<br />
<br />
It's much more of a massive overhaul than many players are anticipating. That isn't to say we don't want to do it, but it's difficult to justify delaying the creation of new art, models, and animations indefinitely to revamp old ones. And we have to make sure to do it in a way that doesn't give some players a feeling of detachment from the look they've had for almost seven years.

I don't think 71-80 was ever lowered. I remember it being 1.337 mil xp 79-80 before, and just last week I leveled my druid up and noticed it was 1.337 mil xp still.</div></div><hr />

And it can follow the same idea as the Treant Restoration glyph for Druids to use either the new tree or the old tree. And then after you would (if so) implement that, IN-game, you can have a tab in the options window to turn on old skin or new skin. So that way, new players looking for cool graphics can go with the Cataclysm skin, and the players from day one can keep their Vanilla skin.</div></div><hr />

Oh god gtf over it. They just freakin started talking about it, let them get it set for current content before you start bitching. And to the next person talking about using it for transmogrification... don't be so damn lazy. Any class can effectively solo most pre-wrath encounters, and if you're worried about dying bring a friend or two along. I'm sure there are plenty of like-minded people aiming for old gear to make it nice and faceroll for you.</div></div><hr />

I detest leveling through Northrend. There's so much travel for so little reward and it slows me down, and I know this is the case for a lot of people. Lowering the the exp means a smoother run through the bore that is the Northrend quests.<br />
<br />
That's my thoughts anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not just the skins - it's the model underneath as well. They're not the same. Skins are easy compared to models. People are wanting high-poly toons, which means the base model has to be updated, as well as the skeleton for that model, so that it moves properly. This means that every animation for those models/skeletons have to be updated. All that times 8-10 races. Humans, Orcs, Dwarves, Tauren, Night Elves, Undead, Gnomes, Trolls, and maybe even Draenei and Blood Elves, as I'm not sure of what their poly count is. Double that for male/female. That's a crapload of work when you consider all the animations a character has. Attacking, casting, getting hit, swimming, dying, all the emotes, etc. It's possible they could do one race/gender combo at a time, but they'd rather do it all at once, and they don't have the resources for that at this time.<br />
<br />
How many times did the female Worgen model get adjusted during Cata alpha/beta? Multiply that times 16-20 for the rest of the races.</div></div><hr />

Sounds promising, I was hoping they would do this.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the Raid Finder allow access to lower raids?<br />
A: Probably not for 4.3, but it's something we'd like to do.<br />
<br />
That's too bad, but at least we can expect it someday.<br />
<br />
Q: Will we see more &quot;intro raids&quot; like Naxx10 in Wrath?<br />
A: Raid Finder is being designed to offer a similar experience.<br />
<br />
Not sure if I understand the question, aren't normal BoT and BWD intro raids? I sure hope this doesn't mean we are limited to only the first tier of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Anyway, still going to wait for the preview before I form a conclusion. I just hope there won't be too many restrictions as I would like to at least queue for the normal modes of current tier, as well as previous tiers. I'll be fine with leaving heroics for the guilds.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you, but I love Outland much more than Northrend, and it's a shame that I can fly past the outlands in about 2 days if I worked hard, where in northrend I'd have trouble managing to do 70-80 in 2 weeks, simply because it's uninteresting, and I've done everything to death there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That what i'm wondering as well. I have used a guide to level before just because I really hate making alts and stuff, But from my observation 1-60 is extremely easy 60-70 is dreadfully slow and then 70-80 is pretty much like 1-60.... its just really fast, I mean it takes me twice as long to level throu outland then it does northrend if you go to the right zones. Even before patch 4.0 i thought it was easier to level throu northrend then it was to level throu outland.<br />
<br />
This is just my guess, But this is what i figure they've done; they decided to pull statistics on all the toons lower then max level (trying to get more people into end game maybe?) and im gonna guess that most of those toons (at least for me) will be in the 70-80 lvl range. So they think there is something &quot;wrong&quot; with that leveling area and decided to nerf xp to get people to level their toons. I guess they never thought people have profession alts and that 75 is the lowest you can be to learn max level professions? I dunno, but w/e the reason its stupid it was JUST nerfed by 20% when 4.0 released... well not &quot;just nerfed it&quot; but still it hasn't even been a year yet...<br />
<br />

Why is blizz buffing the resto 4pc? resto is rocking every fight ever meter in ten heroic twenty five heroic and normal modes. Why not fix other things?<br />
<br />
Easy, if they buff one but not the other.. The class group they didnt buff... will complain. So if they buff the pally version, They have to buff the druid version because if you compare all the 4pc bonus those two classes are more alike. Priests will summon a flame at the targets location or something like that (not a priests just looking at the stuff on wowhead) and the shammy version just doesnt consume riptide. So if they buff one, between the pally and druid 4pc set bonus, they have to buff the other to avoid QQing.<br />

My post was merely a guess as to why both were buffed, Please do not take it as fact.<br />
<br />
I honestly have no idea what so ever as to why this change happened, But what I can tell you is that for the life of me i try NOT to stand within 8 yards of the party. Usually the only people ever around me are ranged, who by definition shouldn't be getting hit because ranged = squishy which is how it was designed. There for, the 4pc bonus is wasted and thus... lackluster I can very much see why they upped the range and dont consider it homogonization. up one, you have to up the other, Not only to avert QQing from the class that was &quot;neglected&quot; but also because if one class healer is having issues with the &quot;proc&quot; being wasted, then so is the other. Again, this is not fact, I do not work for blizzard. Just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />

This has got me excited to hear about the raid finder in more detail. I was kind of expecting it to work to group people up for a certain portion of the raid instance instead of the entire thing (Example, trash packs after lady deathwhisper + gunship battle fight), but I guess that isnt what the plan is.<br />
<br />
If anything, you'll see more variable endgame content in the future to allow players additional progression paths.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;: D So does this mean we will see a 3rd raid size or an extra difficulty option?<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Well Burning crusade zones are also quite quick. You can easily hit 70 in outland without going past Nagrand/Blades edge. The problem with Northrend is that it isn't interesting until you hit Grizzly Hills, Zul'Drak, Icecrown or Storm Peaks. It wasn't like BC where it just got bad over time, it was never interesting.<br />
<br />
Plus if you really want to keep leveling through the zones you can. I agree that it gets a bit TOO quick in some places already but if you don't want to speed level there isn't anything stopping you from taking it slow.</div></div><hr />

In regards of worgen models, aside from a lot of iddle sniffsnaff animations, most of the increased 'bonecount' of the models was not really put to good use, the worgen in-combat animations are mostly limited to quick jerks of the limbs that happen so fast you don't really have time to savour any difference, if any, in animation quality compared to the 'older models'. <br />
<br />
The increased polygon count was mostly put into their idle animations, In my opinion even blood elves and draenei got far fancier combat animations (oh,the dying blood elf male swan anyone...?) than worgen. What makes me sick by now is the constant sniffing sound I have to put up with EVERYWHERE now, in the AH, in groups, in raids, BGs, sniff sniff sniff. Could we -Please- have an option to turn off the sniffing sound? <br />

When you don't have enough ppl working on the project anymore, you run into those problems.<br />
<br />
If you take into consideration that Firelands was supposed to be into T11 content (so, meaning that part of it was alread designed and done), they had to throw away abyssal maw, it took them the lengh of &quot;2 patches&quot; to design 4.3 with yet to be seen if it is enough content for a expansion finisher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd like to see proof that there aren't &quot;enough people working on the project&quot; when it comes to WoW content.<br />
<br />
They explained why Firelands was delayed the way it was. It wasn't completed with Cata release, and then it was pushed back after 4.1 because it would have screwed up the progression pacing, as said HERE (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2179759307) - Link not working atm due to servers being down.<br />
<br />
Our goal with each major patch release, and especially with each expansion, is to learn from the past and use that knowledge to improve the game as we move forward. One of our biggest regrets in the pacing of Wrath of the Lich King was the Crusaders' Coliseum. The Trial of the Champion 10- and 25-player raid was released while many raiders were still busy with Ulduar, which meant a premature end to Ulduar raiding -- and a lot of players didn't get a chance to experience all of Ulduar's content during the normal expansion progression.<br />
<br />
Having learned that lesson in pacing from Wrath of the Lich King, we don’t feel Cataclysm needs a new raid tier just yet. We’re close, though, and Firelands will be part of patch 4.2, which is expected to hit the PTR very soon after 4.1 goes live.<br />
<br />
Also, it's been said why the Abyssal Maw raid was scrapped, several times. If they couldn't make the story work, then they couldn't make it work.</div></div><hr />

Reusing a character model is not even close to being equivalent to updating a character model. There's a lot more work than you seem to want to acknowledge.<br />

And people need to remember that updating the old world for flight was one of the things they said they'd like to do, while they were in the middle of doing it with Cataclysm. They're not going to say &quot;yes, we're working on character models&quot; until they're nearly finished.

Our avatars are supposed to be the most important thing we look at in the game. Taking a good look close up at the original models gives me nausea. Every MMO I have played has one thing in common, the developers are always trying to take focus away from older bugs/issues and/or broken content by dangling a carrot of upcoming features in front of players. It angers me, we aren't toddlers in a store that forget about wanting the candy by handing us the paper receipt to play with. I can guess that the entire art team is under pressure to crank out art for upcoming expansions. I understand Blizz has to look to the future to satisfy players that get bored easily. Yet when you place those ancient race models next to the newer ones and in front of newer high resolution terrain, they look sickeningly out of place. Perhaps the plan Blizz had was to keep the old models in place and get people to spend money to race change to the newer races, that wouldn't surprise me. Blizz just needs to realize the danger of ignoring those old models for too long, in that players might become detached from their characters, and if they lose the emotional attachment and stop caring, it becomes easier to cancel a subscription.</div></div><hr />

They're not the same. Skins are easy compared to models. People are wanting high-poly toons, which means the base model has to be updated, as well as the skeleton for that model, so that it moves properly. This means that every animation for those models/skeletons have to be updated. All that times 8-10 races. Humans, Orcs, Dwarves, Tauren, Night Elves, Undead, Gnomes, Trolls, and maybe even Draenei and Blood Elves, as I'm not sure of what their poly count is. Double that for male/female. That's a crapload of work when you consider all the animations a character has. Attacking, casting, getting hit, swimming, dying, all the emotes, etc. It's possible they could do one race/gender combo at a time, but they'd rather do it all at once, and they don't have the resources for that at this time.<br />
<br />
How many times did the female Worgen model get adjusted during Cata alpha/beta? Multiply that times 16-20 for the rest of the races.<br />
<br />
I work with 3D modeling, texturing, and animation software constantly. Animations would NOT have to be updated unless the proportions change. Each joint of a 3D animation rig is bound to polygons around it, affecting the closer ones greater than polygons further away. Subdividing a model to add more detail may require a minor amount of re&quot;painting&quot; of what's called skin weights for each bone to correspond better with the new poly count, but it's far from having to remake every single animation.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Here's a very small example of what I mean (http://postimage.org/image/18ptwoqxw/), the furthest back cylinder has 1 subdivision along its height and is going to be out low poly character's arm. It has a 3 point joint structure (1 at each end and 1 in the middle). As you can see, one of the joints is raised. The middle cylinder has been subdivided twice and uses the same joints as the first and has the same raised joint. The third is the same model and joints as the 2nd cylinder however it has slightly modified skin weights. Other than the modeling/texturing part, they could very easily reuse the exact same animations they've been using.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing that's &quot;right in front of you&quot; is content you don't approve of. Many people feel the current team is doing a fantastic job, easily on par with previous expansions, and is by no means the &quot;B&quot; team. Don't go full ad hominem because you are seeing old expansions through rose colored glasses.<br />
<br />
The blue post about the old models is pretty much on point. Simply upping the poly count sometimes isn't an option; reworking some of the classic models clearly has a ripple effect across not only the models, but hair styles, the way gear is positioned on them, and probably a dozen other factors. <br />
<br />
The fact that this comes up time and time again shows that regardless of how many times blues answer the same question, no one is happy with the answer. Either people complain there isn't enough content when Blizzard is working on revamping old content (Eg. every other post complaining about cata, when almost all of Azeroth was reworked and remodeled, but level 85s ignore it), or people complain the old content sucks and isn't being fixed (vanilla character models).</div></div><hr />

I don't understand how this is a relevant or appropriate reply to what I've posted. My opinion is no more irrelevant than yours and you and I contribute to the playerbase.

Furthermore, I am not discussing remodeling. I am discussing reskinning. I believe, and this is a guess and I cannot back up this claim with anything empirical, that most people who speak of wanting remodeling really mean reskinning. The two issues get directly intertwined because of the wording blue posters use and because of the lack of knowledge of the way 3D art works. <br />
<br />
I gave examples detailing my opinion and what I referred to included the feral reskins that continue to use the same old model as ever.

It's not that simple with character models, feral cats and flight form druids don't display armor or sit on mounts, i will agree though that the moonkin form could do for a reskin, regardless of the 'but players are attached to them' stance.</div></div><hr />

Please read this (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month). The idea that taking in millions of dollars somehow equates to being able to produce content faster only works up to a certain level. At that point, it actually turns into a slower process, the more artists/engineers/developers are added.

Going to the next expansion at x8 seems to be counter productive because it becomes a complete chore trying to kill things above your level. It's much more efficient stomping on yellow or green things. Much less downtime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As opposed to hardly throwing any manpower and money at something? Do you honestly think the pick of the crop are working on content for WoW anymore? Or that resources are being diverted to the game over anything else? The game is old, it's dying...be it very very slowly, but everything dies with time. So they will continue their slow trickle of &quot;content&quot; while taking players money to the bank, and at the same time will issue statements such as these were &quot;Oh it's hard to do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure it might take a year to update the graphics of all the old races..but you could do that WITH an expansion pack release and easily be done with it then. It's time consuming but it's not THAT time consuming, it doesn't take years upon years to rig a skeleton and model out some meshes and do up some textures. Shit I bet if they gave the community some time people could model their own versions of updated races, they could even hold a contest where the winner gets a job.<br />
<br />

Please read this.<br />

The Mystical Man Month you linked only makes sense if Blizzard was already updating the graphics AND were behind schedule on it. They havnt even started yet, nor will they. So they could hire on a crew of 500 ppl and those ppl would all have time to learn every in and out of how Blizzard does something before it started.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jax</div><div class="date">2011-08-31, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to see proof that there aren't &quot;enough people working on the project&quot; when it comes to WoW content. Unfortunately there is no proof, most intelligent human beings tend to use something called common sense... try it some time. <br />
They explained why Firelands was delayed the way it was. It wasn't completed with Cata release, and then it was pushed back after 4.1 because it would have screwed up the progression pacing, as said HERE - Link not working atm due to servers being down. What could possibly be the reason it wasn't completed? Perhaps because they did not allocate the proper amount of resources? I mean come on the game is almost 7 years old and they cant tell what is needed where and when yet? Then they pushed it back again... meaning AGAIN they didn't have the proper amount of people working on it. Lets call a spade a spade here dude... your telling me there is another plausible explanation? <br />
Also, it's been said why the Abyssal Maw raid was scrapped, several times. If they couldn't make the story work, then they couldn't make it work. This one cracked me up... if you can honestly sit there and think that just because Blizz said it, then that makes it true... I have a bridge in the Florida Keys that I own and would love to sell you... You do know that its a fact not conjecture that they are working on a game called Titan right? You do understand that they will put their top people on this as it will be the next big MMO as they have stated publicly right? You do know that we have been getting excuse after excuse from them on why they cant do this or that? If you cant see that they would use their top talent on their new baby and because of this (not exclusively) WoW has suffered then your just a fan boy and no one takes you guys seriously anyway. ROFL....</div></div><hr />

I mean if all of the costumers want it and players don't care how hard it is, it can't be an excuse. They're making so much profit from WoW but when it comes to a hard task they say &quot;omg it's hard we can't do it right now&quot; just lame.</div></div><hr />

The Mythical man month explains the reason why it causes projects to run even longer; the number of communication channels between developers increases as you add more developers, by adding more overhead. It's not about &quot;having time to learn&quot;, it's about having to communicate between those 500 people in a coherent fashion. You have to read past the first paragraph of the wikipedia article to pick up on that. So not only do you have to ramp up staff to get them to learn the way Blizzard does things... you also have to weigh how much adding new staff will increase the amount of communication will be required between the new staff and the old staff to ensure things don't go off the rails. Again... simply throwing more people at a problem is a futile effort and a logical fallacy. Believing it shows a marked lack of understanding in how both business and software development works.</div></div><hr />

But in this case it would. Hire 1 modeler and 1 artist for temporary work, pay them well and entice them with a great line to put on their resume/portfolio. Spend some time with lead designers on the direction they want the models to look, bang it out in 3 months. This is in no way rocket science. The models are in no way complex. The textures are in no way complex. Optimizing them is in no way difficult. Kids have been doing this stuff in their basement for years.<br />
<br />
Smart ass blue posts like &quot;Well if you think you can do it, or better, then put in a resume&quot; is pure deflection of the truth.</div></div><hr />

I'd say, having 5 85's and only questing from 1 to 85 on every one of them, no dungeons/pvp or anything like that while the XP nerf is nice, what isn't nice is the drop rates on about 99.9% of all Outland and Northrend quests that involve you killing and looting something, all the drop rates are atrocious with zero exceptions, I don't think I should have to kill 30 mobs just to get 7 items when all the mobs I'm killing technically should drop the item.<br />
<br />
A tiny example is after the first few starting quests in Terokkar Forest you go to a camp and every quest is a kill or kill and loot quest, the amount of mobs you have to kill comes to about 130 or so and that isn't counting the absolute trash drop rates so its always going to be more. Since they are nerfing the XP they should also increase the drop rate on every loot quest to 100%, if the amount of mobs you have to kill is factored into the XP since they are nerfing it there is no reason to not increase drop rates. I don't bottom out when going to Outland or Northrend because of the zones, I bottom out because of quests like this and since there are about 2 billion of them in this game... <br />
<br />
I remember one time going through Northrend I had to kill 42 bears to get 6? (no more than 10), 6 items totally unique to BEARS which means they all should always drop this item</div></div><hr />
