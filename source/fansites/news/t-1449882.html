<br />
I was thinking this could have been the final build, if we want to see a patch 3rd or 4th week of Feb. Only thing we might be missing is more PVP changes.<br />
<br />
And yeah, Charge stun removal...didn't expect that. That's sort of an iconic part of the Warrior class. I don't PVP though so maybe it's for the better. It could be a PVE buff if you're trying to avoid stun DR or want to root something (idk, immersus adds, lol) Disclaimer: I don't play a Warrior either, lol, so take it all with a grain of salt</div></div><hr />

It was fine how it was, maybe there is too much mobility with intervene, banners and heroic leap + charge, but charge as a stun was fine.<br />

yeah... hurt every other single player so you can charge the cast on a specific npc. if it is that much of a travesty then tweet something about making them not immune to disrupting.</div></div><hr />

Would make warrior charge weaker than the feral version, which would just be criminal. Though... wouldn't be the first time they did that.

<br />
Perhaps they plan on switching Warbringer and default charge around, make Warbringer a stun and have regular charge be the root... or maybe it's just a datamining error.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously you don't raid *sigh* here's to inform you what I use charge for<br />
protectors interrupting gloom,<br />
sha of pride interrupting big add cast, <br />
galakras- interrupt fractures/shaman heals (multiple times this happens)<br />
Nazgrim- interrupt shamans, mages, ironblades casts<br />
Siegecrafter- stuns mines if they come out<br />
Paragons- stun bloods<br />
Garrosh- stun warshamans interrupts. Stun tiny adds during empowered, stun/interrupt mc's <br />
<br />
So before you say you don't need 2 stuns and interrupts in pve make sure you know what you're talking about. I don't go here and say how pvp humps pve balance. <br />
<br />
This is definitely a shit change to warrior utility if it goes live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Losing charge stun isn't gamebreaking by any means, but it's a handy thing in any PVE encounter with stunnable adds, especially ones with cast bars. I would highlight encounters like Galakras and Nazgrim as very obvious ones, though there's lots of little places you can use it, on trash mobs too. A good warrior tank can have a lot of fun locking down various mobs with a combination of charges, talented stuns, pummels and disrupting shouts, and it's one of the nice things about bringing a warrior tank in comparison to the bonuses of other tanks.<br />
<br />
Losing the ability to charge stun isn't obviously going to break the class for good or anything like that but it's a nice perk in PVE that I will definitely miss when playing my warrior compared to situation as it is now, if this is an actual change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is a 1.5 second stun on at best a 12 second CD if talented (otherwise it's 20 seconds) and requires the warrior to be 8 yards away from you and facing you before he can even use it such a big problem in PVP. There are longer stuns with less directional and positional requirements than charge stuns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So basically blizzard is saying that warbringer (lvl 15 talent) is completeley worthless? (100%).<br />
<br />
4sec and a slow vs 1.5 no slow not really any more useless than it was before.</div></div><hr />

they're not losing charge, only the stun. its not that iconic to stun someone in a charge. apples and oranges friend</div></div><hr />

There are longer stuns with less directional and positional requirements than charge stuns.<br />
<br />
By itself its fine but with the warriors toolkit for stopping casts its a problem.</div></div><hr />

But in this case I *really* hope that's a datamining error for the charge nerf, because it's bad on lots of fronts. Iconic, vanilla WoW ability. Makes a copycat ability (feral charge) better than the original. Affects both PvP and PvE (I'm assuming if it is a valid change, it was done for PvP reasons). There are several adds in current-tier content that can't be interrupted by spell interrupts but must be handled by stuns. Boo all around. Please tell me this is not really in place or was unintentional and will be reversed.</div></div><hr />

In case there is a misunderstanding here, Fortitude is the PvP trinket set bonus... and it will go up next season when resilience is increased again so it will give about the same percentage of actual damage reduction. It's all good! ;)</div></div><hr />

u do realise that most warriors specc juggernaut right since its a 12 sec charge and with hamstring of the GCD you can macro it in so its better than warbringer in pvp<br />

Sounds like a cheap gimmick to make warbringer more attractive for PvP.<br />

&quot;How can we make Warbringer better? We make it better by leaving it alone and nerfing the original.&quot;</div></div><hr />

The main problem was that due to the short CD of charge via talents. Warriors could keep up time on targets while interrupting casting with very little effort.</div></div><hr />

This charge nerf is insane. This is an iconic ability we've had for almost a decade and it's always worked this way. It's even more a slap in the face to the guys that PVE only because this is yet another nerf thanks to PVP balance. <br />
<br />
I'm not one to complain about nerfs or buffs because I have faith in Blizzard, but this is something else. This would be like Blizzard deciding Cheap Shot should be a root instead of a stun for example. When Blizzard messes with iconic abilities that have been fine since day 1 2004 it really does blow the mind I have to admit. Especially since they're doing it now instead of in WoD.<br />
<br />
Sucks to be the warriors that only PVE though. How's it feel to get an ability nerfed again all because of bad PVP balance?<br />
<br />
<br />
they're not losing charge, only the stun. its not that iconic to stun someone in a charge. apples and oranges friend<br />
It is iconic. It's been this way since day 1. Changing the length of a stun is one thing on an ability like this, but getting rid of it is another. Now THAT would be apples and oranges.</div></div><hr />

Get over it, 'iconic' abilities change over time. Remember Druids having to shift out of forms before shifting into another? How about when they made it so that you couldn't powershift out of roots which was there since Vanilla with Furor talent? Still not enough though, I hope we still see mass spell reflect take the place of spell reflect, -20% damage done in defensive stance and reduced damage done while in shield wall/ die by the sword then Warriors will be balanced. They will still enjoy the same damage output but will actually have to play defensively from time to time.<br />
<br />
Rogue change is even better. 50% reduction was just so stupid. Subterfuge and tricks nerf next and Rogue will be balanced.<br />
<br />
Mages next please, 20% ice lance damage nerf and buff Frostbolt by 20% so they actually have to cast once in a while. Also make it so that they give Rdruids something else during Symbiosis aside from Iceblock (I want to strangle the dev that thought it would be a good idea) something like Frost Nova would be a good replacement. Tones down the synergy between Mage and Rdruid and with Rogue getting subterfuge and tricks nerf would be a good balance change to RMD which is such a brainless comp.<br />
<br />
Further down, would like to see some Hunter nerfs to CC especially.Warr Stormbolt plus trap is already stupid, especially once you consider they have scatter and wyvern good to go as well. Again, would be a good nerf to KFC which is almost as mindless as RMD.</div></div><hr />

If warriors want to interrupt they can use you know...their interrupt ability PUMMEL<br />
they still have stormbolt, spell reflect, mass spell reflect, shockwave/dragonroar...charge stun was way too much, a spell that allows them to keep 100% uptime on target and also stun? My 9 years old brother could beat the s. out of any caster with a warrior.<br />
In TBC you fake casted to make them waste pummel, nowdays they can't fail to kick a spell, they preemptively stun you, how's that skilled gameplay?</div></div><hr />

Couldn't it have been addressed with a change to the talent(s) instead? Taking away the stun from Charge feels like something of a cop out.</div></div><hr />
