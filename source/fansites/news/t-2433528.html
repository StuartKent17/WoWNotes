<br />
Upcoming Hotfixes - Azerite Trait Scaling in PvP<br />
Credit to u/Narabug on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldofpvp/comments/9hbnj4/tested_some_azerite_trait_scaling/). <br />
<br />
TL;DR: Damage-based Azerite Traits will deal more damage at higher Azerite Armor/Trait levels, and lowering your overall gear level will make them deal even more damage. For some classes, this may allow you to drop your gear level in order to do extremely high burst Azerite Trait damage.<br />
<br />
Azerite Traits appear to not scale the same as ability damage. Traits that are specifically damage oriented will *always* do more damage with a higher item level, and the difference appears to be roughly the same as the listed difference, even with scaling. For example, if a 340 trait does 600 damage and a 385 trait does 1000 damage, then you may hit your opponent for 1200/2000 respectively with those items equipped.<br />
<br />
We continued to test by dropping item level to see if trait damage was just immune to item level scaling, but it was not. As your item level decreases, the damage your opponents take from traits increases. <br />
There are indeed some issues that you guys have pointed out, which are in the process of being hotfixed. These have to do with Azerite gear slots (and gems) not being weighted in the system as much as they should, and bugs with lower level trinkets being usable at max level. As much fun as it is to relive Taunka Time, we will be working on getting these fixed up. <br />
<br />
I've raised the cap on this thread so any further specific examples you guys have that haven't already mentioned would be great, as getting this resolved is a high priority at the moment. Thanks for all the examples so far.<br />

Arcane Torrent Feedback<br />
Arcane Torrent is effectively a Mass Dispell/AoE Purge, as well as a free HP generation. I think it's pretty fair that one is on the GCD as its still very powerful. <br />
<br />
Shadowmeld doesn't have near that much of an impact if you're comparing what the abilities actually do. I don't think the mentality should be &quot;All Racials should be on or off GCD&quot; but rather what they do individually that dictates that. <br />
<br />
Of course the feedback is welcome but specific examples of why X or Y ability should be on or off is great as always.<br />
<br />
You don't think a VANISH that lets you escape from death every 2 minutes doesn't have as much impact?<br />
When you're comparing the two abilities to each other, no. I think Arcane Torrent is far more powerful in both a PvE and PvP standpoint.<br />
<br />
The ability for classes like Paladins to purge a buff, and generate a HP, in a singular global is very strong. Imagine that off the GCD and it becomes even stronger.<br />
<br />
Game worked fine for 11 years with a much better Arcane Torrent off the GCD isn't specific enough?<br />
I think you need to look in the context of what Arcane Torrent did originally. Since it was a Silence/Interrupt, it would be a little strange on the GCD as interrupts shouldn't be on the GCD. That's at is core is what the ability was made to used for, to silence. So it should be off.<br />
<br />
Now with the rework since its more in line with a Purge, it should be on the GCD. I'm not the biggest fan of some of the GCD changes personally but I think the new Arcane Torrent is an example of something that definitely should be on the GCD.<br />
<br />
What HP generation? It generates a minuscule amount of resources that isn't even worth the 1.5s GCD it incurs. Unless there is something to dispel, it is worthess.<br />
If you play Ret for example, it generates a Holy Power, which is a class resource for Ret. So if all your abilities are on CD waiting for the next ability, you can toss in Arcane Torrent if there is nothing to purge. Which equates to a free Holy Power every time it's up. This can save your Relentless Inquisitor, Inquisition, or Righteous Verdict, so that you can keep those buffs rolling. That's a lot of power for a racial ability. <br />
<br />
There's a reason why its in the Ret opener, and mentioned in the overall rotation, for most if not all guides if you're a Blood Elf. It's small when compared to your regular class abilities but that's a pretty big for a racial. <br />
<br />
Feel free to change it back whenever <br />
I do find myself missing the AoE silence, but I actually prefer the newer version myself. I think it's a bit more of a niche being a purge and I think abilities like that can be pretty fun.</div></div><hr />

I am not surprised but people complained about human racial for years. And then human racial now can counter stuns which is much more better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Holy shit.<br />
<br />
It's so strong in so many M+'s right now, and it's damn useful on Zul too. Being Alliance and not having access to it is a HUGE loss right now. Horde have a lot of mechanics much easier right now because if you don't have at least one Blood Elf in your Horde party something weird is going on.</div></div><hr />

It's honestly much more powerful than the old one,sure,it has more limited uses,but these uses have a really big impact</div></div><hr />

AT was best racial in game for at least the last 2 years, cry more you blood elf idiots.</div></div><hr />

You must be pretty dense not to realise they specifically designed certain M+/encounters around this racial. You're making it sound like these mechanics would still be in the game (at least as often as they are now) if belf racial didn't exist lmao.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc3b65426e43</div><div class="date">2018-09-24, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arcane Torrent change is only a slight nerf to solo fun. In coordinated team situations, it is still very powerful, but when it was a silence, it was much more fun and handy to activate when I was on my own, whereas currently, it is RNG. <br />
<br />
In 3v3, 3 blood elves all doing a torrent at once will shrek things, but if I'm alone in a BG, dispelling something important with AT is not something I'd count on. <br />
<br />
The change has failed in my eyes. It hasn't accomplished a single goal of what the devs intended. In dungeons it's even more brokenly useful than it was before, and even now, it makes some of the encounters much easier. Mass Dispel is only done by Priests, a terrible oversight, other classes should have means of offensive Mass Dispel, but the way things are now, only Blood Elf and Priest can do it. It's huge, and the silence was never such a big deal in a fight.</div></div><hr />

Probably by removing ones that helped dps/combat and made it about being better at professions, faster travel, banking and so on. E.g. fun stuff but nothing that affected gameplay in the slightest.<br />
<br />
I AM aware, however that ship sailed years ago and the screams and outrage of the playerbase would never let this happen.</div></div><hr />

You're wrong, because Alliance exists... and they don't have Arcane Torrent.</div></div><hr />

for this expac it is great, if there was nothing to dispel it would be useless.<br />

a silence would be better but going from garrote into a kidneyshot into a silence again is crazy</div></div><hr />

Either the mobs dont have buffs or cant be dispelled because they are a boss. The use of it in pvp is also miniscule compared to the effect of shadowmeld.... not saying its better but instead of improving this spell they nerfed it to non-existence.. just my 2c</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nihilux</div><div class="date">2018-09-25, 03:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, Shadowmeld is godsent as an Alliance right now. Playing on War Mode, with horde overwhelmingly being bigger than the alliance, it helps doing WQs and has saved me so many times. That's without considering how many times it has saved me time as I travel and suddenly get dismounted by chasing mobs. Or being overwhelmed by pulling too many mobs to aoe.<br />
So for casual play it's utterly amazing for the Alliance side. I imagine it also has some good PvP uses as well, outside of escaping.<br />
<br />
Arcane Torrent has gotten boring though, I used to love using it, but since it stopped being a silence, it just hasn't been as fun and there's other racials I prefer. It's probably still amazing depending on the context, but certainly less fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being able to drop combat when you're doing World Quests if you accidentally pull an extra mob is better than Horde finding the purgeable adds in King's Rest or Zul massively trivial? Or being able to mass dispel bubble shields in Tol Dagor? Or being able to remove Endure Pain in the &quot;Stabby&quot; Lottie Island team? Or the Bone Shield on the skeletons in Underrot?<br />
<br />
Arcane Torrent is sooo good right now.</div></div><hr />
