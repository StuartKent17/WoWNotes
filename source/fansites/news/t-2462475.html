<br />
What follows are the current rating cutoffs as of this post, for the respective titles. These are not the final cutoffs, which will change slightly based on continued play through the end of the season as well as any disqualifications that occur after the season ends, but can be used as a general estimate for what ratings are needed in order to qualify.<br />
<br />
Dread Gladiator – Horde: 2962<br />
Dread Gladiator – Alliance: 2859<br />
Hero of the Horde: 2652<br />
Hero of the Alliance: 2563<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, these are not the final cutoffs, which we won’t be able to determine until after the season officially ends.<br />

WoW Esports in 2019<br />
Today we are very excited to share details for the 2019 Arena World Championship (AWC) and rebranded Mythic Dungeon International (still MDI!), including increases to both programs’ prize pools, which will come from a portion of the sales of two new toys. Let’s get right into it.<br />
<br />
Arena Returns for 2019<br />
We are pleased to bring back the Arena World Championship in similar form as last year—just with a few fun twists. Here’s a visual representation of the system in 2019:<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/thumb/awc01.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/awc01.jpg) <br />
<br />
North America and Europe: The NA and EU regions will have two Arena seasons each, with six cups per season. Each cup will see teams battle for their share of a USD $10,000 prize pool. This represents an increase over last year’s competition, with more cups and more chances for players to win. Like last year, each cup will award points. For each finals event, the top four point-earners per season from both NA and EU will compete for a USD $100,000 prize pool. The first cup begins on Feb. 8; signups start today (https://battlefy.com/world-of-warcraft-arena-world-championship) and will close Monday, Jan. 28, at 10 a.m. PDT/6 p.m. CET.<br />
<br />
Asia-Pacific, China, and Latin America: These regions also will run cups based on the Arena World Championship ruleset. Signups for Korea (https://worldofwarcraft.com/ko-kr/esports/arena), Taiwan/Hong Kong/Macau (https://worldofwarcraft.com/zh-tw/esports/arena), Australia/New Zealand, China, and Latin America (http://www.blizzardcopaamerica.com/) will kick off later in the year. Keep an eye on regional channels for more information.<br />
<br />
Arena World Championship Finals: At the end of the year, we will celebrate the global scope of Arena with the AWC Finals. Invitations will be extended to:<br />
<br />
<br />
1st place from NA and EU Season 1<br />
1st and 2nd place from NA and EU Summer Finals<br />
Top point-earner from NA and top point-earner from EU<br />
Winners of the China, APAC, and Latin America finals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Introducing the Mythic Dungeon International<br />
An invitational no more, we are pleased to announce the Mythic Dungeon International for 2019—a seasonal competition that will showcase the world’s best dungeon-running teams. We decided to update the name of the program in order to better reflect its increased scope and global reach.<br />
<br />
The Upgrades<br />
MDI will be split into two regions: MDI East (China, Korea, Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Australia/New Zealand) and MDI West (North America, Latin America, and Europe). Here is how the year will flow:<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/thumb/mdi01.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/mdi01.jpg) <br />
<br />
The Proving Grounds are a qualification period open to any player with a Blizzard Battle.net account in good standing. Think you’ve got what it takes to be Mythic Dungeon International champions? Grab a team of five players and prove it! All you and your team need to do is complete five level 14 Mythic Keystone Dungeons in time between February 26 and March 12. (Note: Keystone level is subject to change, and will be determined sometime after the start of Season 2, on Jan. 22.) If successful, you and your team will be granted access to the Tournament Realm, where you will be able to create max-level characters, equip them with the items you feel are most optimal, and build out talents as you please. You and your team will have access to the Tournament Realm for the duration of the season.<br />
<br />
Each season, those who have gained access to the Tournament Realm via the Proving Grounds will be able to participate in Time Trials—a limited number of attempts at the week’s dungeons during a designated time period, of which your team’s best results will be submitted automatically. Each week will alternate between East and West, beginning with the Time Trial in ending in the week’s Cup, a double-elimination bracket featuring the top eight teams for that week’s region. All teams on the Tournament Realm will be able to run in their region’s Time Trials every alternating week, which means more opportunities to participate in Cups.<br />
<br />
<br />
Each Cup for MDI East and MDI West will be broadcast live on Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/Warcraft) each weekend across six weeks. There is a USD $12,000 prize pool per Cup, as well as MDI points.<br />
Points will be awarded each week according to results, which will be used to determine who will be invited to each end-of-season LAN final.<br />
The end-of-season LAN events will be cross-regional, meaning the best teams of MDI East and MDI West will meet to race for their share of USD $100,000.<br />
The Proving Grounds for MDI Season 1 for both East and West will begin the week of February 26, when keystone affixes roll over. Closer to the event we will share more information about how to participate, qualification specifics, and more.<br />
<br />
<br />
NEW TOYS FOR ME? I PROMISE I WON’T BREAK THEM THIS TIME!<br />
As both Arena and MDI grow, we want to give fans a chance to further support the programs—and have some fun along the way! Soon we will introduce two new in-game toys to our shop (details to follow). A portion of the sale of these toys will contribute to the prize pools for both WoW esports programs.<br />
<br />
These toys will go on sale in the spring. As the proceeds will contribute to the year’s final LAN event prize pools for AWC and MDI, those prize pools will be announced later this year.<br />
<br />
We can’t wait to get things started.

This is something that has been done for years by far bigger online competitions, like Dota2, which has a massively bigger player pool and reward pool.<br />
You don't have to buy toys or pets if you don't want to..<br />
<br />
<br />
paying for a flavor item, that should be a gratification through gameplay...<br />
<br />
Cosmetic nonsense has been sold countless times before, and will be sold in the future. And now you notice?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Cosmetic nonsense has been sold countless times before, and will be sold in the future. And now you notice?<br />
<br />
And due to players voicing their justified opinions about MT cosmetics (the helms), they stopped. <br />
<br />
The ignorant argument &quot;you don't have to buy them if you don't want&quot; and &quot;why does it bother you now&quot; or even &quot;you can just buy it with gold&quot; is an absolutely terrible argument. You need to understand this, please. It is an unequivocally foolish and surface level argument. Unless people like you start recognizing how your flawed opinions aren't as enlightening or rational as you think they are, the sooner things will change because people will vote with their wallets. <br />
<br />
If you keep letting your principles slip, the less the market can correct for errors.</div></div><hr />
