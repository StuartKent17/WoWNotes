<br />
Timewalking Firelands is active anytime Cata TW dungeons are in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When Cataclysm Timewalking is active, max-level players will be able to form a raid group and enter the Sulfuron Spire once more. As with previous Timewalking raids (Black Temple, Ulduar), your gear and power are scaled to the challenge, and all the bosses and rewards you expect lie in wait.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't talking about their body composition. I just wanted to know if they are kept alive by magic or by simply being turned into beings that don't die.<br />

Seeing we get a raid for each warbringer to be an endboss, which so far are both alive(Jaina and Aszhara) it's kind of logical that Sylvanas will be as well, and also not dying. Her goal is what we know through Before the Storm, Stormwind.<br />

It's obvious that Sylvanas isn't getting out of this expansion as the leader of the Horde let alone the Forsaken. It's also convenient that Calia just happens to be Undead now and with a brand new model.</div></div><hr />

He sort of did, though? Basically used that term for two men who might be in a gay relationship. <br />
It's like someone mentioning the dark complexion of Wrathion and someone else saying &quot;he's a dragon, he's not a n*****&quot;. It still implies you use that word to describe such a person, doesn't have to be directed at anyone on the forum specifically.</div></div><hr />

Instead of saying &quot;gay&quot; he decided to use a derogatory slur, so even if he didn't he still referred to gay people as such.<br />
<br />
<br />
if anything he said that Anduin isn't a fag<br />

Because we live in a world now where PC leftists are pushing their blatant agenda on the masses. Where little innocent kids are growing up to be mentally warped. We are far beyond the acceptance of gay rights. Things are getting out of control now. I am also a dad and my 6 month old son only cares about food, sleep, and spending time with mom and dad. He's not thinking about sex as many perverts would have you believe. Like the crazies who want to add P to lgbt for pedosexuality. This so called &quot;science&quot; and &quot;born that way&quot; is absolute bullshit. Influence is real, but people buy into the lies and are too stupid these days to realize it. Gay Witch Hollywood knows this to be true so they warp our kids. This world is a disaster and it's just going to get worse unless people rise up.</div></div><hr />

I don't think merging the factions is going to happen. In the book, Anduin tried to work with Sylvanas so the Forsaken could see their living loved ones. Unfortunately, most of them were so upset and disgusted at seeing their Forsaken family members that they turned their backs on them and walked away. Unless a major shift happens, the Alliance isn't going to accept the Forsaken. There may be similar stories for the other Horde races too.</div></div><hr />

It’s obviously why it’s offensive, it doesn’t need explaining. There’s also no argument here, I’m not arguing. Facts are facts, that word is offensive. Also linking an article, although you’re bias against the source, is just one of many and a way of gaining someone else’s view on the matter. If you don’t like the huff, sure, there’s many of articles from numerous sources explaining the matter. If I cried “offensive” and “run away” I wouldn’t have replied to the people that have replied to my comment now, would I. But I refer you back to the first line of this post - it’s obvious why it’s offensive. Knowing the word alone is knowledge enough that it’s an offensive and derogatory word. Sure, some people might not know the deep history behind it but that’s why it’s also incredible easy to look up and find articles that explain why. It’s the same with the N-word for example - most people know it’s offensive but don’t fully know why or the full history of its use.</div></div><hr />

I knew exactly what I said and I know its offensive. That lash-out happened because I am tired of PC identity politics in literally everything I watch that was made in 2018+, extreme feminist agendas to destroy iconic characters, SJW cultural mental implementation, and the absolute dire communism that plagues the United States of America right now because of it. Before 2018 and the WOKE bullshit, I coexisted with people as best as I could and things were fine. Now a days you almost like clockwork have 1 of each race, 2 gay dudes, 2 lesbians in every fucking narrative no matter if it fits or not. This blight on media has gone too far. Just ask Proctor and Gamble after losing 8 billion dollars from the WOKE commercials making all men look like rapists.</div></div><hr />

The last time I checked MMO is not a government entity and is not obligated to do anything to protect your speech. For someone spouting about needing a life you sure lack any legal knowledge that would be relevant to your statements.<br />
<br />
The right to free speech exists to all people from birth till dead (could say before and after). Doesn't need the government to protect it or give it. Free Speech needs protection FROM the government.</div></div><hr />

Models are incredibly detailed and well designed all around. That camel is goofy as all hell, as it should be. Looks like Valeera is going to have some interesting hair physics. Man does Calia have a stunning jaw. That over the shoulder cloak tho. Plenty of casters who would love having that.<br />
<br />
The big question is, do we get a unique Wrathion Dragon model? Or did I miss that?<br />
<br />
Is there also anyway to create collapsable windows for the long lines of strings, so those who want to read it can click it to expand it ? Would make the news updates more UI friendly when browing through the info.</div></div><hr />

WoW Classic gets the garbage ass 1.12 AV despite considerable community backlash over that, but Retail gets a far more original vision with the old Troll and Gnoll regions and bosses?<br />
<br />
Amazing.<br />
<br />
... So it begins.<br />
<br />
Getting the Classic AV as part of Classic, is sort of what one should expect. Yes, new designs and new takes on old stuff, will be for the version that ISN'T slated and specifically recreated to preserve content from 2006... <br />

I have a 3 years old and a 2 months old, both boys. I am also worried about how far they are taking this pro LGBT thing. By all means I am all for respect for them and all that but they are pushing everything down our throats right now.<br />
<br />
2019 and people still believe these things are contagious, much like autism.<br />
<br />
Clearly, it needs more normalizing, not less.</div></div><hr />

Being the leader of the forsaken is one thing, but you must remember forsaken are members of the horde too. And they wont leave the horde because of gameplay reasons.<br />
<br />
I really really think with more stuff being datamined and how the story progresses that we end up merging. It would open so many possibilities.<br />
<br />
Agreed. I'm 95% confident that the factions will be merged next expansion, 4% if it isn't next expansion than the following one, and 1% that they won't merge the factions.</div></div><hr />

That lash-out happened because I am tired of PC identity politics in literally everything I watch that was made in 2018+, extreme feminist agendas to destroy iconic characters, SJW cultural mental implementation, and the absolute dire communism that plagues the United States of America right now because of it. Before 2018 and the WOKE bullshit, I coexisted with people as best as I could and things were fine. Now a days you almost like clockwork have 1 of each race, 2 gay dudes, 2 lesbians in every fucking narrative no matter if it fits or not. This blight on media has gone too far. Just ask Proctor and Gamble after losing 8 billion dollars from the WOKE commercials making all men look like rapists.<br />
<br />
I mean hey, like I said, just pointing out offensive language because it’ll only get you banned. Oh wait...</div></div><hr />

THere's nothing overtly awful about it. It is what its meant to be and conveys all her themes. I like the sharp cheek bones.</div></div><hr />

The right to free speech exists to all people from birth till dead (could say before and after). Doesn't need the government to protect it or give it. Free Speech needs protection FROM the government.<br />
<br />
But again this is not a government and therefore no one has a right to free speech here. But so long as you abide by the terms of use then your speech shall not be infringed. <br />

I was just pointing out to the person that getting all huffy and pulling the &quot;Muh RIGHTS&quot; card so quickly is why lawyers exist; Everyone just interprets what they want. And just browsing Mmo's fine print certain words can be see as off limits and not permitted.</div></div><hr />

I won’t say it’s terrible but it seems...lazy for lack of a better word. Looking at it seems like they just slapped a Void Elf color pallet on a human model.<br />
Not really complaining though, the same can be said about Syl and Nathanos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Zekhan's gear is amazing. But his generic face looks more like Zekhan's dad, than a young troll.<br />
Just put the mask back on.<br />
<br />
Valeera looks great except, of course, her shoulderpads. <br />
I bet they weight as much as the rest of her, and will be her cause of death when they get stuck on something or people inevitably bump into her. lol.<br />
Oh Bliz...<br />
<br />
Calia.. yeah, not a fan of the Captain Planet Team. Stop the gimmicks. <br />
Give us real and cool characters, that are properly themed.<br />
<br />
The camel mount looks great!<br />
<br />
Deathwing mount... Yeah, same as with most special mounts.<br />
It looks great, but makes no sense or doesnt fit the game.<br />
Why and how would i have Deathwing as my mount??? He is dead and much bigger.<br />
And even if i somehow managed to do that, how can there be two of them in the same spot?! Jeez.<br />
You could have made like a random dragon, onto which we strapped armor pieces of the actual Deathwing... but no, lets make no sense instead.<br />
<br />
The Alterac ram looks AMAZING. wow!<br />
<br />
The frostwolf looks great as well.<br />
<br />
And i must say, i'm extremelly surprised that Blizzard bothered to make new icons for every little thing.... <br />
they usually just use the same old icons that have nothing to do with the item..<br />
like... a green hunter's bow will also be used as the icon for a cucumber in cooking, and such.</div></div><hr />

Hahaha.. You're right, my friend. And obviously, it also goes the other way around, beeing exposed to «straightness» won't make you straight. That's basic logic. But brain dead people will swear that there must be an &quot;agenda&quot; or some illuminati conspiracy behind it.<br />

I don't see this happening. It would mess with the dynamic of the game. The very core of World of Warcraft is Horde vs. Alliance. They can't remove that.</div></div><hr />

Don't think anyone think its contagious, at least not anyone thats normal. Thing is people are getting tired of everything being pushed as a gender/transgender/homossexual fight. Some of us just want to play games and see movies for fun, not for some group's agenda.<br />

Not saying it makes anyone gay, its just its annoying and confusing. Its not necessary to push this LGBT argument in every movie/tv show.</div></div><hr />

There’s also no argument here, I’m not arguing. Facts are facts, that word is offensive. Also linking an article, although you’re bias against the source, is just one of many and a way of gaining someone else’s view on the matter. If you don’t like the huff, sure, there’s many of articles from numerous sources explaining the matter. If I cried “offensive” and “run away” I wouldn’t have replied to the people that have replied to my comment now, would I. But I refer you back to the first line of this post - it’s obvious why it’s offensive. Knowing the word alone is knowledge enough that it’s an offensive and derogatory word. Sure, some people might not know the deep history behind it but that’s why it’s also incredible easy to look up and find articles that explain why. It’s the same with the N-word for example - most people know it’s offensive but don’t fully know why or the full history of its use.<br />
<br />
Saying something is obvious and saying there isnt an argument isnt an argument. Neither is saying facts are facts. I mean your viewpoint is basically &quot;LALALALALAL IM RIGHT YOUR WRONG&quot; (covering ears).<br />
<br />
Here i can be as smart as you Its not obvious its not a fact and there is an argument. Dam that was easy maybe next time someone questions me regarding something ill just respond like that. <br />
I dont know why i entered the thhought of you trying to have an actual dialogue when every response you give is full of nothing.</div></div><hr />

It's actually based upon facts, though. If you're unaware why that word is offensive then honestly Google is your best source for, y'know, looking up the reason why. The answer is easily finable out there - I shouldn't (and won't) essentially do your research for you.</div></div><hr />
