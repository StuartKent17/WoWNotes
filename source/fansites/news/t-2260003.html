Video - Making The Lich King Armor for Blizzard<br />

Toy Box - Spooky Toys<br />
Today we are taking a look at three different spooky toys and how to obtain them. Obtain 300 toys and you’ll receive the Mechanized Lumber Extractor (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140500-mechanized-lumber-extractor) mount, which is very similar to the Sky Golem (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/134359-sky-golem).<br />
<br />
Kalytha’s Haunted Locket (http://www.wowdb.com/items/68806-kalythas-haunted-locket)<br />
If you’re interested in playing as a ghostly female night elf, Kalytha's Haunted Locket (http://www.wowdb.com/items/68806-kalythas-haunted-locket) is for you!<br />
<br />
<br />
Features a 30 minute duration and only a 15 minute cooldown, making it one of the few toys that will allow you to chain transformations and stay disguised for as long as you’d like!<br />
Transformation isn’t broken by combat or mounting, and your character can still show off its awesome Artifact appearance.<br />
<br />
<br />
As long as you have the Flight Master’s License (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/90267-flight-masters-license), obtaining Kalytha’s Haunted Locket is quite simple!<br />
<br />
<br />
Head out to Azshara (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/16-azshara) and find Tex Vortacoil (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/36375-tex-vortacoil), a goblin vendor located inside Archmage Xylem’s tower.<br />
He'll sell you Kalytha's Haunted Locket (http://www.wowdb.com/items/68806-kalythas-haunted-locket) for 5,000 gold.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Death’s Door Charm (http://www.wowdb.com/items/129149-deaths-door-charm)<br />
If you’d rather be a ghostly version of your own character’s appearance, the Death's Door Charm (http://www.wowdb.com/items/129149-deaths-door-charm) is the perfect choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
This transformation has a 30 minute duration, and the Charm’s cooldown is 1 hour.<br />
Requires Revered reputation with Legion’s Valarjar faction.<br />
Once Revered, simply head over to Valdemar Stormseeker (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/106904-valdemar-stormseeker), the Valarjar Emissary located at Valdisdall in Stormheim (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/7541-stormheim) to purchase the Charm for 425 gold.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Haunting Memento (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116139-haunting-memento)<br />
If you’re in the market for something a bit more unpredictable, the Haunting Memento (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116139-haunting-memento) is a fun little toy that can be used to “haunt” yourself or another player. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Haunting Memento (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116139-haunting-memento) can be purchased from Chester (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/85484-chester) on Darkmoon Island (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/5861-darkmoon-island) at a cost of 90 Darkmoon Prize Ticket (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/515-darkmoon-prize-ticket).<br />
Every three minutes, the afflicted player will fall victim to a haunting effect.<br />
There are over ten different Haunted effects, including:<br />
<br />
The sky turns into a ghostly blue stream of souls<br />
The player is swarmed by giant spiders<br />
The player is transformed into a skeleton or hideous beast<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
issue is mythic plus, you get CoEN, RIP your key no-one wants that shit.<br />
<br />
people don't mind hard but they want a reward worthy of the difficulty and effort, and a mythic+16 HoV vs mythic+16 CoEN is a world of difference for the same reward?<br />
<br />
also these abilities we're probably limiting high end mythic+ progress by 1 shotting players, if you check wowprogress most dungeons are peaking around 22-23 cleared, while these are at 20, all reward the same AP same ilvl of loot, so they should be around the same difficulty.</div></div><hr />

It didn't actually work at all, any healing done with light of dawn wouldn't be shared at all.</div></div><hr />

Oh. I run AoM and never noticed, though I only started healing a few days ago for the first time since Cata so i probably just assumed it was how it was meant to be! Good news. More healing.</div></div><hr />

It was fairly doable after the last round of nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think his point was that so many have written the place off that nerfing it to what it should have been won't be enough. I'm not sure anything will be enough at this point.</div></div><hr />

It's a recurring theme throughout the history of WoW. Making obvious and avoidable mistakes is apparently not a career-limiting maneuver at Blizzard.</div></div><hr />
