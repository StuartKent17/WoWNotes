Patch 5.4 - Timeless Isle Chests<br />
Last week (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3321), we talked about the new BoA ilvl 496 tokens on the Timeless Isle and the ability to upgrade them to 535s with a Burden of Eternity (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103982-burden-of-eternity). Today, we look at the biggest source of these items on the Timeless Isle: chests. <br />
<br />
While the Timeless Isle hosts many different rare mobs and events, by far the fastest way for a character new to the Timeless Isle to get epics is through finding these chests. The catch is that almost all of the chests can only be found and looted once per character and you have to compete with other players for respawns (though they're short).<br />
<br />
There are several major types of chests on the island, so here is a list which also serves as a legend for the map below. Keep in mind that contents and locations can change before these go live. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tier 1 (1): These are on the western half of the Timeless Isle and have the name &quot;Moss-Covered Chest&quot;. They contain a very small amount of Timeless Coins and can sometimes contain an epic token.<br />
Tier 2 (2): These are on the eastern half of the Timeless Isle and have the name &quot;Moss-Covered Chest&quot;. They contain a few hundred Timeless Coins and can sometimes contain an epic token.<br />
Tier 3 (3): These chests are located in hard to reach places and have many different names. The western two of them are on top of cliffs and are accessible by using a Highwind Albatross (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/73531-highwind-albatross). Another two are in caves, and the final one is an area densely populated by Gulp Frog (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/72777-gulp-frog)s. These chests all contain a few hundred Timeless Coins and multiple epic tokens.<br />
Tier 4 (4): These chests are located in the middle of groups of Ordos yaungol and have the name &quot;Smouldering Chest&quot;. They contain several hundred Timeless Coins and multiple epic tokens.<br />
Tier 5 (5): This 'ultimate' chest, the Blazing Chest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/221673-blazing-chest), is located in the western part of the Ordos Sanctuary and can be tricky to reach due to the large amount of high-level elites in the area. The chest contains a medium amount of Timeless Coins, a few epic tokens, and a guaranteed Burden of Eternity (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103982-burden-of-eternity).<br />
Daily (D): As the name implies, these chests can be looted once per day, unlike the majority of the island's chests. All of them are in places that require effort (and even some platforming skills) to reach. Additionally, they all drop Lesser Charms of Good Fortune in addition to a medium amount of Timeless Coins and a possible epic token.<br />
Weekly (W): As the name implies, these chests can be looted once per week, unlike the majority of the island's chests. Both of these chests are underwater and require a bit of fighting to reach - one even requires a key from the mobs around it. Additionally, they both drop (~5-15)Lesser Charms of Good Fortune in addition to a medium amount of Timeless Coins and a possible epic token. The southern-most Weekly chest also will contain a Cursed Swabby Helmet (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/104038-cursed-swabby-helmet) the first time you open it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
In addition to lots of loot, these chests are now linked to achievements as well. Finding all of the 'one-time' chests (Tier 1-5 in the list above) will net you the achievement Treasure, Treasure Everywhere (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/8729-treasure-treasure-everywhere). If you loot both Weekly chests and the eastern-most Daily chest (all three are pirate-themed), you will receive the achievement Where There's Pirates, There's Booty (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/8727-where-theres-pirates-theres-booty), and you can receive the achievement Extreme Treasure Hunter (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/8726-extreme-treasure-hunter) for getting the other three Daily chests.<br />

Patch 5.4 - No Epic Gems<br />
It seems we won't get epic gems during Patch 5.4.<br />
<br />

Raid Testing Schedule - August 6<br />
On Tuesday, August 6, we will continue testing raid encounters in the Siege of Orgrimmar raid. We're moving on to 10-player Heroic testing at this time, and then 25-player mode as the PTR cycle progresses.<br />
<br />
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below for all Public Test Realms.<br />
<br />
Tuesday, August 6<br />
Thok the Bloodthirsty - 10 Player Heroic - 10:30 PDT (13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST)<br />
Iron Juggernaut - 10 Player Heroic - 16:00 PDT (19:00 EDT, 01:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />

Hunter Spec Identity<br />
Long-term (ie: not for 5.4), we will be making some bigger changes to the Hunter class. It may not be a full class revamp (like the Warlock revamp in 5.0), but we do want to give the class a full once-over and make sure that the specs feel different and unique. We are not planning any further, class-wide mechanical changes for 5.4.<br />
<br />
We have not yet balanced DPS for Hunters (or anyone) for 5.4. When we do, we'll make sure that as much of that balancing as possible is done via signature shots.<br />
<br />
Before you get excited, note the wording &quot;as much of that balancing as possible.&quot;<br />
By that, I meant that signature shots are going to be the primary target for any buffs to bring Hunter damage up, but there's only so much we could buff them depending on how much actually needs to be done. We wouldn't, say, allow Explosive Shot to tick for 500k just to bring Survival PvE DPS up. Instead, we'd bring up Explosive Shot as much as we comfortably could, and then make minor tweaks elsewhere if further balancing was necessary.<br />
<br />
Marksmanship has been a spec without a niche this entire expansion which is why it hasn't been played.<br />
Apologies for picking out one part of your post, but I think this illustrates pretty well the exact issue we'd like to fix post-5.4. We'd like to make sure that all three specs have a bit more &quot;identity.&quot;<br />

Misc<br />
MMOC forums let me keep my job again (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1327056-Do-you-think-Greg-quot-Ghostcrawler-quot-Street-will-lose-his-position). Whew. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363187762016423938))<br />
<br />
Also still trying to figure out which RPGS hold RNG as a time honored tradition. Especially as far as player prog is concerned<br />
Any game with a crit chance or a range on damage (e.g. 7-13) inserts RNG into determining the outcome of a fight. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363731476925251585))<br />
<br />
Not blaming you personally but why does there seem a lame excuse every Q call when Sub losses are announced.<br />
I think the intent is to provide context, not an excuse. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363197065527959552))<br />
<br />
I just wonna say, that we're sick of this argument due to double standarts.<br />
Okay. That doesn't make it go away. There are only 8-10 working hours in a day. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362455852633952256))<br />
We appreciate feedback on features you like, but we don't want to leave it to the community to decide how we spend our time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362455991134060544))<br />
(The community would never agree anyway.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362456035291697153))<br />
Don't use &quot;we have no time&quot; argument then, tell the truth - &quot;we don't want to do it&quot;.<br />
We say we don't want to do something when that is so. Other times we are just stacking high vs. low priorities. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362460571871879168))<br />
We usually do get around to the low priorities eventually. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362460649005133824))<br />

Patch 5.4 - Vengeance Diminishing Returns<br />
Keep in mind that this is a translated post, so details can be lost. Thanks to ngacnlcq for the translation (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1328802-Diminishing-return-mechanism-on-Vengeance-in-Patch-5-4). <br />
Brief summary: You will get 1/N of the full Vengeance when hit by the mob within 5 seconds who has the Nth highest DPS. This &quot;N&quot; will be recalculated each time you are hit.<br />
<br />
For example, you are tanking 3 mobs: one is the Boss and the other two are mobs. The Boss has 1.5 million DPS, one mob has 400K and the other has 300K. The system will now sort these mobs by their DPS: <br />
<br />
1. Boss: 1.5 million DPS, so you will get 1/1 (100%) of the full Vengeance.<br />
2. The first mob: 400K DPS, so you will get 1/2 (50%) of the full Vengeance.<br />
3. The second mob: 300K DPS, so you will get 1/3 (33.33%) of the full Vengeance.<br />
<br />
This mechanism will be recalculated when you are hit by even more mobs within 5 seconds(1/4, 1/5, 1/6,etc). Additionally, in the example above, if the first mob is not attacking you while the second mob is, you will get 1/2 of the full Vengeance by this attack instead of 1/3.<br />

WoWDB Addon Data Collection<br />
Collection data on things like Timeless Isle drops and locations is done with the help of many players. The more people that contribute data, the more accurate and quickly we can update the database. <br />
<br />
To help out, just click here (curse://enable-wowdb-upload) if you have Curse Client already installed. <br />
<br />
When you are playing the addon will gather data and save it. When you are done playing, Curse Client will see the game close and upload the collected data from the addon. You can see the last time data was uploaded by looking in the Plugins tab of the options, as well as making sure the addon is enabled there. Be sure you have Curse Client open before you close WoW so that the data will upload! <br />

They let BS be a little ahead in Cata, but in Wrath they tweaked all the profession perks to be in line with Blacksmithing's new value (ie +400 primary stats instead of +320).<br />
<br />
Agree that we're better off without them. I think they just decided epic gems are an unnecessary hassle. Wouldn't be surprised if we never see them again, at least in the previous final-tier incarnation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes thats how awsome this game is. BTW any of you played GW2....? People that enjoyed events, jumping puzzles and exploring will find it brilliant.<br />
Does it drop the max gear? no. <br />
So? go and get the max gear IF you can from raiding, nothing stops you and you will have better gear from this anyway.. <br />
You can get gear with so many way these days, but you can also choose to do heroic raiding for the best gear.<br />
<br />
Gj blizz. Really gj. Every cent i give you these day you make it count. Renewed for 6months. :cool::cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
To customize/optimize your gear.<br />
<br />
Gear is there to progress your character, or you call enchants character progression too?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chests, no matter what level, always had a higher chance of dropping gear. What's the problem with getting items even lower ilvl than ToT LFR (496&lt;502) from chests?. The 535 upgrade item will probably be pretty rare.</div></div><hr />

As far as the artwork ( method used to draw these images ) my questions is why are you concerned about this. Personally I find this refreshing and nice to look at and to my knowledge there is no copyright on how you draw things.<br />

After reading the whole article and a couple of wowhead pages I am still not clear on how to get them. Is it just one guaranteed burden from one of the chests per alt, and any after that are very random drops from mobs on the island? I also read that you can buy them for 50k coins?<br />

Also epic gems will probably come in 5.5, which is kinda almost confirmed by now.</div></div><hr />

Guess that to you surprise, yes... they do.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but other &quot;lesser sites&quot; copy it from MMO... that's where most of your &quot;average&quot; (and even lower than average player) reads this kind of info.</div></div><hr />

Im more irritated due to soloing purposes. Some of the bosses require vengeance cheesing to solo. I see a bunch of stuff we are able to kill now easily become either much harder to do or basically getting too close to the enrage. I finally just killed LK heroic, and mostly did it due to vengeance cheesing now I have to pray I get invincible before 5.4 =/.</div></div><hr />

They're phased after you've looted them, they can be opened in combat, and they have a super fast respawn, and some, like the daily ones, don't even despawn at all and can be chain looted. There isn't going to be chest camping and probably minimal competition for them in the first place given the way they were designed.<br />

Wait until you've actually seen how it functions before you get riled up about it. <br />

There is absolutely a demand for it, and many players will use and appreciate the map. Of course it destroys the mystery but I highly recommend that players who want to maintain that not use a treasure guide. I'd like to think most players can make the decision for themselves based on what they prefer.</div></div><hr />

How about no.<br />
<br />
Raising concers BEFORE this stuff goes live is exactly when people should be riled up about this. Also its a PTR, fast respawns are kinda normal, while the population is nowhere near the one of populated realm, its not a strech to assume respawns are gonna be longer and the demand is gonna be high (hell, on my realm, if I wanna farm warbringers I still have to go at 3 AM because people are constantly farming them and thats just for a mount, not for actually decently powerful gear)<br />
<br />
Your prediction isnt any better in that regard than anyone elses, so I dunno why you act like you know something more. <br />

<br />
To be honest I'm still curious as to the overall purpose of adding in low(er) level epics to new patches. Seems a bit odd to me. Like when 5.3 happened and you get i496 from the Kor'Kron tokens when all of the current epic (good epic) ilvls are 522+. Is it a sating mechanic? &quot;Here, we know you lowly LFR junkies/casuals (their thoughts, not mine...I'm an LFR junkie) probably couldn't get much, if any, good epic gear during ToT's run...so here...&quot; /tosses tokens in our face<br />
<br />
But lest we forget - the progressive raiders have some deep-seated NEED to feel special about their higher ilvls as compared to us &quot;nobodies&quot; who &quot;can't play the game.&quot;<br />

<br />
When did you start playing wow? I'm assuming either during wotlk or cata and most likely probably cata. <br />
<br />
The whole reasoning behind lower ilvl epics is so previous content does not become obsolete. The three five mans at the end of cata made it so firelands, bot, bwd, and to4w became obsolete as you didn't need to do them to get into DS LFR or normal DS. They are keeping all content relevant to an extent. I am absolutely OK with this because I absolutely hated that they spent all this time on content only to make it obsolete the next tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that person responds to a pug in trade chat, you take a moment and armory them. If they are NOT wearing raiding gear (that is, gear from the current tier normal or heroic) you do NOT invite them.<br />
<br />
Also - LFR gear should be blue, not purple. If anything - color LFR pink.</div></div><hr />

There's no reason to be so hostile. I'm just trying to assuage people's fears.<br />
<br />
Concerns should definitely be raised before things go live, but I don't this its fair to pass of panic on a third party website about things that are currently not true to be synonymous with expressing critiques to Blizzard. By all means, if something is poorly designed people should totally complain on the PTR forums before it makes it live. The problem is that (a) posts here are not raising concerns with Blizzard and (b) people are &quot;raising concerns&quot; about things that there is no evidence to suggest are true.<br />
<br />
The people commenting about hypothetical worries like four hour respawns and having to fight people for chests and other things that they are imagining in their minds as some kind of worst case scenario. Whether the instant respawns on the PTR will manifest on live is one thing but even if it doesn't (and it very well might), getting upset because one assume something is going to function one way is getting ahead of ourselves. It doesn't function that way on the PTR, and while the PTR might not accurately reflect live, it's a lot more reasonable to believe the content as it currently exists than based on changes we assume will happen based on nothing but worry.<br />
<br />
And aside from the issue of respawning chest, as I said, many of the chests do not despawn at all when looted for other users; they simply phase out for the people once they've been opened. This applies to all the daily chests (and I am pretty sure the weekly ones but I'm not positive there) which will be the ones looted the most. There is zero competition on those, regardless of respawn times or PTR vs live population or any of that.<br />
<br />
Some things are always going to be harder on a high pop realm, of course. Overall, the island has been very well designed with population size in mind and I think it's pretty fair to point that out to players. A great deal of the chests are phased, the rares (and even some of the regular elites) are shared taps, and stuff like the lootable sand and nutrients are all over the place and (currently) respawn super fast.<br />
<br />
Criticism is fine but it should be levied against things as they are and not as people imagine they are. A lot of the people who are upset based entirely on assumptions and I'm just saying people should see how it actually works before declaring the sky is falling.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow, good thing that map with numbers is the first thing people see when they open MMO... before they read what it is about, they already lost the mystery.<br />
Let's be reasonable here. No one who glances at the map now is going to remember the precise locations and coords of the markers in a few weeks when it makes it live.<br />
<br />
But really if someone does have an amazing photographic memory but doesn't like spoilers, they probably shouldn't read the news posts at all since they contain tons of PTR previews, datamining, and lore spoilers and always has.<br />
<br />
I think it's a lot better to provide that kind of information and let users decide for themselves whether they want to utilise it or not than to not provide it at all.</div></div><hr />

Epic gems are not needed. They need to break the pattern, it's always the same stuff every expansion. You don't seem to get it either, you get the epic gems, x and y also, so it makes no difference if you improve your character. <br />

Actually, it's very interesting. Please correct me if I am mistaken, as I have been away from WoW and only got back a few days ago. 5.4 is the patch where we fight Garrosh, right?<br />
<br />
If no, then sorry, my logic is flawed. No point reading what comes next.<br />
<br />
If yes, saying &quot;epic gems not happening in 5.4&quot;, means they will eventually happen still in MoP. If Garrosh is the final boss, what are they holding up their sleeves? Some surprise boss aka Sunwell or Ruby Sanctum to introduce next expansion?<br />
<br />
