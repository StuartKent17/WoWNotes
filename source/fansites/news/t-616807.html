09/30 - Upcoming update on Beta/PTR Servers<br />
Tonight, both beta and PTR servers will be updated to a new build.<br />
We will be taking down the Beta realms at 2:15PM Pacific time today September 30th 2008 to update to the latest build<br />

WotLK Arena Changes<br />
<br />
We've revaluated certain aspects of how the arena system and current arena season will be affected during both the next content patch, and the launch of Wrath of the Lich King. For starters, the current arena season will end in respect to the ladder upon the release of our next major patch. What this means is, we'll be taking a snapshot of the current season's ladder just before the realms are taken down for patch maintenance, and our normal process will commence to determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards. Teams and ratings will not be wiped at that time, and will carry forward allowing players to earn points each week (and buy gear) until the launch of the expansion on November 13th. Almost immediately before Wrath of the Lich King releases, all arena teams as well as ratings will be wiped and arena charter NPCs disabled.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">memento</div><div class="date">2008-09-30, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another reason for me to hope they will go closer to November with their patch release. Could become a very boring month if they go for mid October. I am sure all the class-changes will break the sunwell encounters and make them a hell of a nightmare - even without bugged addons and DPS-Classes trial and erroring their new threat generation.<br />
And now Arena will also be over.<br />
<br />
Still have this tiny little hope for the kind of 3 week long mega lore event introducing the launch of Wotlk. But I guess that's just not going to happen - again<br />
<br />
So I would actually like it if 3.0 comes out in lets say first week of November</div></div><hr />

There will be a lore pre-wotlk event, as far as I know ;)<br />
Razing of Orgrimmar, that is. Maybe something similar for Alliance. Will do my best not to miss it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, seeing as entry level PVP gear gives ~20k to 22k health. That's like someone having 10k in blue HWL at 70.<br />
<br />
So a 6k crit heal would be like a 3k crit heal at 70.</div></div><hr />
