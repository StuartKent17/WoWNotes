http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png Free Character Migrations Available<br />
If you're on one of the source realms listed below, you can move your characters to one of the designated destination realms and avoid the queues—for free!<br />
<br />
By initiating one of these transfers, you will be moving your character to a new realm and home. This is a one-time, one-way move. If you wish to move your character elsewhere, you will need to use the paid transfer service.<br />
<br />
<br />
Draenor / Silvermoon =&gt; Magtheridon / Bronze Dragonflight / Chamber of Aspects<br />
Kazzak / Stormscale / Sylvanas / Twisting Nether =&gt; Grim Batol <br />
Outland =&gt; Grim Batol / Drak'thul<br />
Ragnaros =&gt; Grim Batol / Frostmane<br />
<br />
<br />
Please be aware that, due to the unpredictable nature of free transfers, we may close down any Free Character Migrations at any time and without warning if the target realm becomes full. If you plan to move with friends or your guild, we suggest that you coordinate the effort to reduce the chance of any stragglers being left behind.<br />
<br />
Early closures aside, this set of Free Character Migrations will end on Tuesday, February 4.<br />
<br />
Begin a Free Character Migration now (https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/fcm/character-list.html?r=EU&amp;l=WoW1)! We recommend reviewing the FAQ (https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/free-character-migration), as it details what is or isn't allowed for transferred characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
None of these EU realms that you can migrate from are merged realms. Grim Batol was merged with the Portuguese realm Aggra. Grim Batol were the home for Portguese people before they got their own realm, and since then more English players probably moved to the realm. I'm guessing that's why they are opening free migration there to balance the English/Portuguese population... or they are just clueless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arms Warriors represent around 15% of players at 2200+, Feral Druids have about 1.6% representation. So, no, it'd be unlikely they would make any changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol Don't worry. The Way of the Warrior has always been for every buff they give a warrior, they break them hard soon after. In fact the one time warriors weren't nerfed after a buff, people thought it was April Fool's Day.</div></div><hr />
