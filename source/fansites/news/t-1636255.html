Warlords of Draenor - Gearing Up for Heroic Dungeons<br />
A few people have mentioned having trouble getting the item level required for heroic dungeons, so here are a few ways to grab some easy upgrades:<br />
<br />
<br />
There are several item level 610 quest rewards from Nagrand. These can randomly upgrade to epic item level 620 items. (Coif of Grasping Earth (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118156-coif-of-grasping-earth) =&gt; Coif of Grasping Earth (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118156-coif-of-grasping-earth?bonusIDs=545))<br />
Proving Grounds (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/37433-proving-grounds) bronze will reward an item level 610 weapon (http://www.wowdb.com/items/119463-staff-of-trials), which can also randomly upgrade to epic item level 630 (http://www.wowdb.com/items/119463-staff-of-trials?bonusIDs=15) or rare item level 620 (http://www.wowdb.com/items/119463-staff-of-trials?bonusIDs=171).<br />
There are several rare spawns that drop item level 620 rare gear (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=620&amp;filter-ilvl-max=620&amp;filter-quality=8&amp;filter-source=8). (Not all of it is listed yet, install the WoWDB addon and help!)<br />
PvP Honor gear is item level 620: Cloth (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor/cloth?filter-ilvl-min=620&amp;filter-ilvl-max=620&amp;filter-source=256), Leather (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor/leather?filter-ilvl-min=620&amp;filter-ilvl-max=620&amp;filter-source=256), Mail (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor/mail?filter-ilvl-min=620&amp;filter-ilvl-max=620&amp;filter-source=256), Plate (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor/plate?filter-ilvl-min=620&amp;filter-ilvl-max=620&amp;filter-source=256), other armor (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-ilvl-min=620&amp;filter-ilvl-max=620&amp;filter-source=256&amp;filter-slot=71684), and weapons (http://www.wowdb.com/items/weapons?filter-ilvl-min=620&amp;filter-ilvl-max=620&amp;filter-source=256).<br />
Normal dungeons offer item level 615 gear (Grimrail Depot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/890-Warlords-of-Draenor-Grimrail-Depot), Shadowmoon Burial Grounds (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/894-Warlords-of-Draenor-Shadowmoon-Burial-Grounds), The Everbloom (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/856-Warlords-of-Draenor-The-Everbloom), Upper Blackrock Spire (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/915-Warlords-of-Draenor-Upper-Blackrock-Spire))<br />
Apexis Crystal (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/420-Warlords-of-Draenor-Apexis-Crystals) allow you to purchase rare item level 630 gear (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-sold-currency=823&amp;filter-ilvl-min=630&amp;filter-ilvl-max=630&amp;filter-quality=8&amp;filter-source=16384) for 3,000 to 5,000 crystals each, which can be upgraded later for more crystals.<br />
The legendary quest line rewards an epic item level 640 ring (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor/rings?filter-ilvl-min=640&amp;filter-ilvl-max=640&amp;filter-source=1024) from running Normal difficulty dungeons.<br />
There are some crafted items (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=601&amp;filter-ilvl-max=641&amp;filter-source=2) you can make with a Level 2 profession building. Keep in mind you can only equip three crafted items at a time.<br />
There are a few other options, but they are likely not accessible yet or easy for most people. These include BoE world drops, Level 100 garrison missions, and more. <br />
<br />
<br />
Followers and Garrison Missions XP<br />
Got an update from one of our designers that wanted provide more information on how your Followers gain XP when you send them out on Garrison Missions.<br />
<br />
When Followers are below a mission’s level, they get a reduced percentage of the mission XP as well as any bonus XP earned.<br />
<br />
Followers that are 1-2 levels below the mission level:<br />
<br />
The Follower’s level number is displayed in orange, meaning they only receive 50% of the mission XP and bonus XP. <br />
Followers that are 3 or more levels below the mission level:<br />
The Follower’s level number is displayed in red, meaning they only receive 10% of the mission XP and bonus XP. <br />
Before a hotfix that was implemented at 5:52pm PST, followers in red received 0% of the mission XP; and we felt that was not what we wanted since the UI didn’t indicate that was the case. <br />
<br />
<br />
Note that while level 90 missions may only award ~100XP, level 100 missions award much more, closer to the range of ~1500XP. So 10% of that is still a good amount for a level 90 Follower, even if they won't be doing a great job at getting the bonus loot until they gain some combat experience.<br />
<br />
We’d love to continue hearing feedback on how it feels to level Followers, what missions are available, and how these new numbers feel.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Bug Fixs<br />
Is the enchanters study suppose to not disenchant epics? Or is it bugged?<br />
Intended (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/534490881177305088))<br />
<br />
Is it intended to obtain ilvl 660 tournament gear for gold? Is it an exploit people make use of?<br />
Obtaining it, yes, as it's only usable in War Games. Using it to bypass ilevel requirements is not. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/534477126032846848))<br />
<br />
just a thought: scale the 680 rings back to 640 for anyone without the quest completed<br />
We're exploring options, too early to say at this point. (Rygarius (https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/534585507087273984))<br />
<br />
Doesn't seem to mention the change made to the Smuggler's Run loot table - no resource boxes any more?<br />
We generally do not note changes designed to fix an exploit. (Rygarius (https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/534533862911909888))<br />

You get 2-3 items from PvP vendor and stay in Ashran so the PvP items bounce up to 675/660.<br />
<br />
Took like 1 minute. Works flawlessly as DPS as well becuase you still can pump out nice damage with so few items as long as you have heirloom weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Wargame gear will probably get fixed.<br />
The regular PvP gear I was talking about will not get fixed (it isn't fixed, neither the scaling or the ilvl, but then again why would they fix it? It's not exactly an exploit)<br />
<br />
You only need 3-4 PvP items without the scaling to be eligable if you've been questing. With the scaling (which is still in effect, as it should be) pushes you up to 640+ with as few as 2 items.<br />
<br />
Even if you didn't have the honor cap to begin with you would just queue Ashran and get like 600-800 honor every 10-15 minutes or so.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't? Jeez, enchanting is their pet profession, isn't it? Aside from JC, it's now the only profession worth getting. But now we know that they also can still sell epic enchanting mats on the AH.<br />
<br />
Whereas LWers, miners, and herbalists get shafted when it comes to their crafting mats.</div></div><hr />

how did you get that much honor, I did ashran yesterday for 2 hours, won every battle, I got like 150 honor points in total over 2 hours, (no strongboxes either). <br />
I think you only get so much honor if your faction is outnumbering the other one and farming the npc and players in their base, but that is not the case on every server.<br />
And with all the pve heroes in ashran bumping up their Ilvl, pvp people have to sit in queue for hours and hours to enter ashran, hope bliz will fix this shit.</div></div><hr />

i was wondering the same thing. i'm in your same exact situation. i don't particularly need GR now that my trade post/lumber mill/stables have kicked in, but i am curious as to why it was an exploit and what was supposed to happen.</div></div><hr />

Ya, I was thinking the same. It's not an exploit if it was designed into the game. Also, don't they usually make a big song and dance when they find and close off an exploit?</div></div><hr />

I had honor cap before the expansion, so I ran in just in time, we were about to win, bought one item, won, bought another item, and I was over ilvl 600 as soon as I hit 100.<br />
<br />
Not sure what the honor is based around. It was 600-800 honor per win for me but then again Alliance is basically stomping &quot;hordes&quot; on my server.</div></div><hr />

Yes there was an exploit circling around that made it possible to reset the cooldown on the smuggler guy everytime you entered an skirmish game. Which resulted in ppl spamming smuggler guy while queing skirmish, do 1 attack and leave (to avoid derserter) to gain resources quickly. I did this myself and got 3k in 1 hour.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand this. What is the catalyst for getting your gear to upgrade? It sits in your bag and just randomly *poofs* up 10 ilvls?<br />

There was an exploit where you could reset the cooldown of your smugglers thingy I beleive and just keep summoning him and get 345457456 resources from the box xD Guess they removed it as a fix for now</div></div><hr />
