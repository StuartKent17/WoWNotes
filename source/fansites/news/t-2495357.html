Achievements<br />
<br />
Revealing treasure chests while scrying in Nazjatar should now reliably grant credit for Nothing to Scry About.<br />
<br />
<br />
Creatures and NPCs<br />
<br />
Prince Erazmin's best friend, Scrappy, is now better at traveling Rustbolt to encourage the resistance. He should no longer occasionally fall through the ground.<br />
Unleashed Arcanofiend’s Proximal Chaos attacks are now a bit less chaotic.<br />
In Nazjatar, there are now fewer slugs in rocks. Eww.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Epic gems with a secondary stat now provide 50 of the secondary stat (was 60).<br />
<br />
Developers’ note: The power increase of Epic gems over Rare gems is too large, putting players in situations where the right choice is to use a much lower iLvl item with a socket over a Titanforged upgrade. We’re making this change before Season 3 begins to limit the number of affected players.<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that caused some punchcards in the to be labeled &quot;Titanforged&quot; at a lower item level than intended. (No items were harmed in the making of this bugfix.)<br />
Chain Ignitercoil (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168327-chain-ignitercoil) is no longer sold by vendors in Mechagon.<br />
Secret Fish can now be sold, and the sounds they make have been fixed. Don’t tell anyone.<br />
Ionized Minnows (https://www.wowdb.com/items/167562-ionized-minnow) can now be stored in the Reagent Bank, as well as Engineering and Fishing Bags.<br />
The following now automatically use reagents stored in your reagent bank:<br />
<br />
Crafting all Junkyard Tinkering blueprints.<br />
Contributing to construction projects.<br />
Using the Charging Station to charge Empty Energy Cells.<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
The Seething Rage buff from Blood of the Enemy (Essence) will now properly modify the critical damage dealt by any summoned units, such as those summoned by a Shaman or a Monk's Storm, Earth, and Fire.<br />
Classes with pets that use energy will no longer cause their pets to gain an increased energy regeneration rate when using Memory of Lucid Dreams (Essence).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Missions and Followers<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where some players could receive the Zen'lan Lost Treasure Map mission a second time with no loot. The mission is now removed if it has already been completed.<br />
Missions with the Deep Sea mechanic now have a base time of 24 hours and are properly countered by Naval Expert.<br />
<br />
<br />
Player vs. Player<br />
<br />
“Call to Arms: Nazjatar” can now properly be completed by slaying the opposing faction in Nazjatar.<br />
Battle for Nazjatar<br />
<br />
Additional improvements have been made to this event. It should now become active more often, while still ensuring that there are mix of Horde and Alliance players present.<br />
Factions that control more capture points within the Battle for Nazjatar event will now yield more Victory Points. This works similarly to Arathi Basin or the Battle for Gilneas.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Reduced the amount of quest items needed to complete many Requisition quests and Bounty daily quests in Nazjatar.<br />
&quot;The Reclamation Rig&quot; construction project will now more reliably give achievement credit to all players who contributed to its construction, even if further away when it is completed.<br />
Players can now see Venture Co. Transport Balloons while &quot;Taking The Air Out&quot;.<br />
“The Doppel Gang” should now reliably give credit to all players who participate.<br />
Avarius should now spawn as expected once all the Brinestone shards have been placed.<br />
The Zoatroid Harvesters required for &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; now path better, and are more tap friendly, with appropriate health.<br />
<br />
<br />
Support<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue preventing some players from submitting tickets in-game.<br />
Fixed an issue that caused some tickets submitted in-game to incorrectly show as submitted via web.<br />
<br />
<br />
World Quests<br />
<br />
A recent change in diet has made the chitin on glimmershell crab shells more resistant to breaking during combat, resulting in Hefty Glimmershells of usable quality dropping more frequently when you’re in &quot;A Steamy Situation&quot;.<br />
The spell intended to recover your corpse during “Infestation of Madness” no longer incorrectly sends your corpse to Nazjatar.<br />
<br />
<br />
World<br />
<br />
Players should no longer experience phasing issues around the Tidestone in Nazjatar.</div></div><hr />

First time I did this event today, can say it was really &quot;fun&quot; being overrun 10 to 5 by the Horde and then having them camp Mezzamere after having capped every single point and instantly win before we could even get some people together.

<br />
Yeah, its a shame so many of us refuse to help make it an even(ish) fight by turning warmode on. Its such a pita getting us to leave it on longer than it takes to get the weekly rewards even though we have no problem holding our own in fights with comparable numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't use warmode at all, no matter how much they try to bribe. The whole world pvp system is rotten in its core and needs to be reworked completely. It should not overlap with PvE activities at all; instead provide a separate path of progression etc. and own rewards, not related to PvE. It's possible, Blizzard is just too lazy to create a proper PvP environment out in the world - and as long as they are lazy, I will boycott this feature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there a need for it?<br />
I mean Nazjatar/Mechagone mobs shouldn't be at the same power level as Zandalar/KulTiras mobs. It's an area with better rewards so of course they are gonna hit harder. After getting HC EP and Season 3 gear then we will be at a power level comparable to them just like we are now comparable to Zand/KT stuff.</div></div><hr />

How are stat gems fun?<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondary stats are what make the game fun. Its fun to have 40% haste and 50% crit and gems give more secndary stats. Blizzard nerved the secondary stat scaling for BFA because they dont know how to make a fun game anymore.</div></div><hr />

Yes - because nerfing obviously OP gems ruins the fun. Good thinking<br />

<br />

<br />
The new zones are designed around people to be in mechagon/ new raid gear - so most people are below that item level range. It'll fix itself over time</div></div><hr />

Chain Ignitercoil is no longer sold by vendors in Mechagon<br />
<br />
Kek, why though?<br />
<br />
they are super insanely common and blizz originaly had that as they were more rare, but now more common they removed it, as i assume people would buy it, then get a ton, then cry to blizzard wanting gold refunds.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
When mob damage will be reduced?<br />
<br />
&quot;I miss when there was danger in the world, vanilla is the best&quot;<br />
&quot;when will they nerf nazjatar to make it trivial?&quot;<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
From what I've done of Nazjatar Battle, the best fix would be to just give all Horde players the free conquest each time a battle's up. <br />
It would save them having to run round the entire zone trying to find one Alliance to kill.<br />
<br />
except alliance have this same problem on many shards, we had many times in the first week where i got no rewards cause i could find 0 horde.<br />
<br />

It seems logic. If you think having 40 haste and 50 crit is what makes the game fun then you should probably find a game with more action. You probably also think it is fun doing 1 million dps by pressing 1 button.</div></div><hr />

A 420 item should give you a meaningful amount of more secondary stats in relation to a 385 item but blizzard fucked up the scaling and everything you get is a million mainstat that is boring as fuck. End of story.</div></div><hr />

Fucking hell. How does nobody understand this. For a 40 ilvl upgrade you get like 400 mainstat and about 10 secondary stat. The scaling is completely fucked.</div></div><hr />

It's not supposed to, but they're absolutely everywhere, and an extra action button will appear when you're near one. When you open one, you have a chance of receiving a buff that makes them visible on your map for (I think) two minutes. If you keep chaining them one after another, the odds of keeping the buff up are pretty good. There are some other buffs you can get instead, such as move speed or stealth, plus one that extends the duration of the Scrying Stone itself.</div></div><hr />
