Rise of Azshara Preview: Heart of Azeroth Updates<br />
Azeroth’s need has never been greater—and now more than ever, Speaker Magni Bronzebeard and the titan watcher MOTHER need your help to heal the world’s grievous wounds.<br />
<br />
In Rise of Azshara, we’re introducing a new system for the Heart of Azeroth that will provide additional power customization options: Essences. You’ll collect these Essences by taking part in a variety of content, and infuse them into the Heart of Azeroth using the new Heart Forge in Silithus, giving you access to new abilities and bonuses. <br />
<br />
The Speaker’s Quest Continues<br />
Once you’ve established a new hub in Nazjatar, one of the new areas in Rise of Azshara, you’ll receive a summons from Magni to join him at the Chamber of Heart. There, you’ll learn that MOTHER has completed her calculations related to what's plaguing Azeroth, and determined a way to heal her well ahead of her original 77-cycle estimate. New forms of power have begun to coalesce and manifest around Azeroth’s wounds, and MOTHER has discovered that these “Essences” are compatible with the Heart of Azeroth. To make use of them, she has created a new device in the Chamber of Heart that can harness that incredible power: the Heart Forge.<br />
<br />
The Essence of the Heart Forge<br />
The Heart Forge lets players infuse their Heart of Azeroth with Essences to grant new combat-related powers. Once you’ve collected a new Essence—obtained by participating in a wide variety of content—you’ll head to the Heart Forge to infuse your Heart of Azeroth with it, “learning” the Essence and permanently adding it to your collection. Much like Talents, once you’ve learned an Essence, you’ll be able to apply it or swap it out through a new Heart of Azeroth interface within rest areas, cities, or when using items such as the Tome of Quiet Mind.<br />
<br />

<br />
Each Essence has both Major (generally active) and Minor (passive) abilities. Upon completing the initial quest from Magni, you’ll open a single Major slot in the Heart of Azeroth. Placing an Essence in the Major slot grants you that Essence’s Major active ability, which is added to your Spellbook. You’ll also gain the benefit of any Minor passive abilities from the Essence.<br />
<br />
There are also two additional Minor slots in the Heart of Azeroth that will activate the Minor (passive) abilities of any Essences added to them. The first Minor slot will become available at Heart of Azeroth level 55, and the second Minor slot will become available at Heart of Azeroth level 65.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
In Essence <br />
Essences are acquired from a variety of content in Battle for Azeroth. You’ll earn your first one by completing the quest line with Magni, but you’ll be able to earn others through completing specific activities, such as PvP, raids, or World Quests.<br />
<br />
Each Essence has four ranks that provide new effects. Rank 1 provides a unique ability based on your role (damage dealer, tank, or healer), while rank 2 and rank 3 provide enhancements to both the Essence’s Major and Minor effects. Rank 4 adds a flashier cosmetic effect to the spell, providing a unique visual that will make you stand out from the crowd. Once an Essence is learned, you’ll be able to hover your mouse over the Essence in the user interface to see what you get with the next rank. And because of how Essences are collected, it’s possible to receive and infuse a rank 3 Essence without having learned rank 1 or 2.<br />
<br />
It’s important to note that while many Essences are role-agnostic, some of these are only usable by a specific role (tank, healer, or damage dealer). Characters who can spec into multiple roles can collect any Essences that are appropriate for those roles, but the system will restrict characters from collecting Essences meant for roles their class can’t fill—for example, a Warrior couldn’t collect a healer Essence.<br />
<br />
More Azerite Gear Ahead?<br />
Essences add a whole new layer to the Heart of Azeroth system, in addition to the Azerite Armor that you already have. With all the content coming in Rise of Azshara, there’s are sure to be some new Traits to discover and gear to collect along the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like, they're giving us a grant total of ONE new and awesome usable ability. And not that, that one single active ability is also a super generic ability that doesn't have anything to do with your spec or even your class at all, probably meaning that it's going to have 0 interactions with anything and is just a button to press on CD or something else to line up with your other cooldowns.<br />
<br />
Like, if that's their big revamp, if that's what they've been working on for 6 months, maybe even longer, who knows, then holy fuck, that's just lame af. I'm a fucking Hunter, I don't want to channel stupid azerite laser beams at my enemies - gimme a new azerite shot or coat my pets in azerite or what do I know. If that's seriously the best they can come up with then there's seriously no hope that anything about the gameplay is going to change at all during this expansion. Honestly, this just looks awful.</div></div><hr />

&quot;ah, my ridiculously circuitous plan is in motion.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is basically glyphs with extra steps... And really dull sounding.<br />
<br />
They should have just scrapped the system entirely. People don't like it. I'm sure they put a lot of development resources into its design but it's way too little too late and is rather they just improve the core specs rather than keep adding the cobbled together messes they call &quot;progression&quot; that get reverted each xpac anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand this uses a completely new resource, further proving that Azerite is meaningless, can only be accessed with from one ingame object and worst of all: Is role specific. Why is that a problem? Cause class design is completely netured in BfA. If not even THESE give an identity to classes (or god forbid specs), nothing in BfA will.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Irian</div><div class="date">2019-04-11, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sure do wish any of this shit wouldn't just go away when the expansion ends. <br />
<br />
These are just glyphs with a fancy UI which, while welcome, will inevitably boil down to wanting a particular one for your character. This also just feels like what everyone was asking the Heart of Azeroth to be to begin with, so it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth that they went with that shortsighted first idea and then went &quot;Ooops! I guess it turns out that didn't work out!&quot; No shit it didn't, players including myself were expressing our concerns since beta with the system's design.<br />
<br />
In general I just wish there was more to our characters on a fundamental level rather than all this useless expansion fluff piled on to a bland and forgettable base. If you're going to bring glyphs back, why not just...you know, not fucking remove glyphs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm doubtful. I don't really want 'Azerite' to be a thing in the next expansion - and this stuff doesn't look very class-specific yet. Don't really want more pruning to have even more abilities everyone else shares.<br />
<br />
<br />
No idea why i thought we get class specific abilities and not this generic bandaid fix. Sad.<br />

Yeah, was hoping to see some class specific stuff, too. Oh well - getting closer to summer and Classic.</div></div><hr />

But hey, lets just create a new worthless ability with only a minor cosmetic difference to &quot;stand out from the crowd&quot;, because that's what truly matters!</div></div><hr />

Don't worry, they will. But instead of Artifact Azerite Power it will be called something else that starts with A.<br />
<br />
It will be completely new system though! Different name and different UI! Completely different!<br />
<br />
In general I just wish there was more to our characters on a fundamental level rather than all this useless expansion fluff piled on to a bland and forgettable base. If you're going to bring glyphs back, why not just...you know, not fucking remove glyphs?<br />
Because they need illusion of content. AP grind gives illusion of progression, even though its nothing but illusion. Glyphs didn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look I know we have all been burned by the HoA and the way we collect traits but let us not jump to wild conclusions without even testing it. This was was but ONE of the &quot;many&quot; essences that exist. Who knows what the data mining will find - maybe there will be generic ones and spec specific ones. If we find out there is not I will totally recant what I've said and your complaints will be fully warranted - I am just saying we should be reserved until we see some additional essence abilities as I doubt this one can fully capture all the ones that I can imagine would exist.</div></div><hr />

But on topic. I am excited, its something new, could it just be the same old shit with a new coat of paint? sure, but I'm gonna give it a go see what it is. Anything new Blizzard add is worth trying. And this system I hope will give me the same satisfaction the artifact system did in Legion. Fingers crossed :D<br />

suspect real change will only take place when there's new faces on the team.<br />

The most of the classes were, at worst, fine, during Legion. How they managed to fuck everything up so consistently during BfA deserves some begrudging respect.<br />
<br />
I expected nothing from this system cha he yet am still, somehow, disappointed.

To me the RPG aspects were important to the game. Without them I don't care for WoW. And retail has nothing to offer in that aspect. Now, Vanilla on the other hand... clunky, sure, but fills in both the MMO and RPG aspects - and got a much more satisfying reward system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's one for Prot Pally:<br />
&quot;Memory of Lucid Dreams<br />
Clear your mind and attune yourself with Heart of Azeroth, increasing your Mana generation rate by 100%, and your Leech by 874, for 10 sec. <br />
Shield of the Righteous recharge time reduced by 50%&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll assume on a Prot Warrior this becomes something to do with Rage generation (highly dobutful it'd be 100% increase though) and reduces recharge on Shield Block. <br />
<br />
So it's not the &quot;exact same&quot;, hence it's class specific.</div></div><hr />

Its another layer. So instead of them dumping Azerite Armor concept in favor of Heart of Azerite style Artifact / Path of Titan they're just adding another layer of restrictive grinding with restrictive choice. More layers of makeup to disguise the ugliness beneath.<br />
Just like when they said rings/amulets/trinkets would have more variety instead of just generic statsticks they lied and made it near-impossible to target single-secondary stat pieces while making &quot;interesting&quot; choices none-choice because they removed player abilities scaling item effects outside PPM.<br />
Nobody wants Azerite Armor. It was a flop. Get rid of it. Take a knee.<br />
<br />
These devs hate player contingency. They don't want players having meaningful choice. They also feign ignorance to avoid consequence for their own choices. &quot;Do as I say, not as I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tired of this fucking doublespeak. Who are they appealing to? Sure as hell isn't the playerbase. Who are these fictional stockholder entities that do and provide nothing but accumulate intellectual property yet paying customers have zero input? All this crap does is fuel the clown-world meme.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is litterally the legion artifact tree in a new wrapper. <br />
<br />
You start with 1 golden trait. The golden trait has the active and passive effect.<br />
You get 2 medium traits. These are passives, but can mildly effect gameplay such as reducing the cooldown on spells which can significantly change some rotations. <br />
You get a few minor traits inbetween medium traits. We dont know what these will be yet, but sounds like most of legions non golden traits huh?<br />
<br />
You can also change them all around anywhere in the world to fit the situation. <br />
<br />
Dungeon spec.<br />
Raid spec.<br />
Pvp spec.<br />
Open world spec. etc<br />
<br />
They also plan by 8.3 to unlock another major trait slot, 2 more medium trait slots, and some more minor trait slots. <br />
<br />
Is it straight up fixing classes? No, but this system with good classes would be amazing. Dont blame the system. No system could fix classes in the middle of an expansion with reworks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Character progression at Max level has gone to complete shit. <br />
<br />
These notes have pushed me to the limit. Official unsubbed. Waiting for classic to start. <br />
<br />
At least with classic we know what we're getting and can sink 2-3 years into playing something enjoyable. <br />

<br />
For what old school runescape is I'd say it's succesful. It has a very low budget and the gameplay and graphics are super outdated. Im saying despite how aged the game is It's doing better than anyone would expect it to. Wow has moved so far away from what the original creators of the game envisioned it isn't even the same game anymore. It's just get to 120 on our railroad, do mythic+, follow minimap icons for killing stars and kill bosses in raids. Professions only have a couple items you can make now and are completely streamlined without having to level them up from past expansions so old materials become useless. No one needs to go back and mine copper ore in durotar anymore. They just go straights to BFA mining. But for what? Their blacksmith can only make BoP stuff that is irrelevant by the time you can craft it.<br />
<br />
At least in that game getting levels actually matters. Professions, quests, slayer, etc are all interwoven to create a whole game that depends on all its parts. The gameplay itself can be boring, but you have so many goals and different paths to prioritize &quot;should i get herblore up to 50 to access this quest so I can unlock ability to use *blank* or should I level my combat? Should I raise my magic for access to higher alchemy and more teleports?<br />
<br />
WoW Is just &quot;get to 120, increase item level, do esports&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone will have the same Essences none are class specific, they could have made them like the Legion Artifact traits, but I guess that was too much work for them, hell, they could have used the same Artifact traits as legion, at least something interesting. but no this system is boring as hell.<br />
<br />
There will be straight off the bat , one best Essence for casters, one for melee, one healers, one for tanks, one 2nd best for… etc etc and EVERYONE will use those, everyone will have the exact same offensive ability the exact same defence ability etc, sorry it sucks, its boring, it lacks innovation, as obviously been designed with very minimal thought, it’s nothing special when everybody has the exact same thing.<br />
<br />
What’s happened with Developers actually being developers this is just basic boring C**P</div></div><hr />

Just another alt catch up zone that will be dead in a month because everyone has farmed all their benthic gear already.<br />
<br />
Also lul @ HoA &quot;update&quot;... I don't think they could come up with any less inspired ideas than this. It really seems like the devs are just bored of WoW and can't come up with anything exciting anymore. <br />
<br />
With any luck next expansion they'll finally realise that artifact items and focusing your entire character's progression around that one piece of gear is a really bad design for an MMO.</div></div><hr />
