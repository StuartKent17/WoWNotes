Patch 5.4.7 - Dread Raven Mount<br />
Patch 5.4.7 contains the Reins of the Dread Raven (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/109013-reins-of-the-dread-raven), which is likely to be the Collector's Edition mount that goes with the Dread Hatchling (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/77137-dread-hatchling) Collector's Edition pet. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Currently Horde has 1 more race/class combo than Alliance... any chance we'll see parity in WoD? Night Elf Paladins FTW!<br />
Count of race/class combos isn't something we aim to balance. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425490197782872065))<br />
<br />
Could we see guardians (Garg, S.fiend...) benefiting from %dmg buffs (Primordius f.ex) in the same way pets do?<br />
It's a bug whenever they don't. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426293476628504576))<br />
Will full pets always benefit? Didn't on H stone guardians/protectors of endless for sure. Possibly sha of pride and norushen?<br />
Yes. Any encounter buffs to your damage should affect your pets and guardians as well. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426420439091388417))<br />
<br />
I am so sick of doing less damage than others of my spec b/c of total rng. Why bother trying in ur rppm joke game?<br />
RNG actually has relatively little effect on total DPS over a whole fight. How you respond to that RNG is bigger though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426281542889902081))<br />
<br />
Don't you feel that too many ground-targeted spells suffer from the 'No path available issue?'<br />
It's &quot;2&quot;, but yes, that's too many. Unfortunately required in order to prevent exploits. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426151955975524352))<br />
It's really annoying with totemic projection, impossible to tell wether or not it will work at times.<br />
Ah, forgot that one, yep. Totemic Projection, Demonic Gateway, and Heroic Leap. Oh, bah, Banners too. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426154196832763904))<br />
Never really got why it's fine for warriors to scale, nigh vertical terrain with charge but not heroic leap.<br />
Because we know that it's fine for the warrior to be up there, because someone else already is. #TransitiveProperty (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426199926008078337))<br />
<br />
Any chance active talents on the same tier could all get a &quot;Mage Bomb&quot; style button?<br />
Yes. We will do this when it's appropriate (similar role, all actives). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425853861593509889))<br />
I think means talents from the same tier should auto-update on the ability bar after switching chosen talent.<br />
Right, that's what I responded to, no? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426100182623588352))<br />
<br />
6.0 tanks will do 70%(?) dmg of a DD-since you can kill every boss with every tank, isn't it obivous best dmg tank&gt;other tanks?<br />
No... We'll be balancing tank DPS just as much as we balance DPS DPS. Tanks have their own strengths and weaknesses, as always. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425299926109519872))<br />
Are things like Monk single tanking Blood Rage on 25H intended?<br />
Wasn't an expected way to handle it, but it doesn't cause any problems, so we're fine with it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425854936123838464))<br />
<br />
have u considered giving other classes abilitys like charge and disengage its more fun with more movement abilities in combat<br />
Yes, they are quite fun. Almost all classes/specs have movement abilities like that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425854109862744064))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br />
Any plan on removing the big dmg penalty on Glyph of Enduring Infections ? Losing a glyph slot should be enough.<br />
No, that's an intentional nerf to their damage, since the effect is so gigantic in PvP. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425850998246998017))<br />
So no plan on even basic dispell protection for Necrotic plague ?<br />
The glyph would affect Necrotic Plague. Additionally, it can still spread from a diseased target to a just-dispelled target. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426090524513034241))<br />
If I infect Mobs A and B manually using plague strike, does the spread from B stack with the application on A?<br />
No, it only spreads to targets that aren't already infected. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426297247534309377))<br />
<br />
Unholy four piece feels bland, mind taking a look at it or possibly changing it to something more fun.<br />
It's OK for some set bonuses to feel bland. Hopefully not all, but occasionally alright. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426169198549540865))<br />
But, I mean, even off pieces contribute more then the four piece itself simply b/c of better itemization. It's very weak imo.<br />
Again, it doesn't have to be the case that everyone always uses their tier set. Occasionally not is alright. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426170652286935040))<br />
<br />
If you remove the damage bonuses from DK strikes granted by diseases, what role do diseases serve?<br />
...damage? Am I missing something? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425371963763474432))<br />
And if you remove those % bonuses, what role do diseases serve in the DK rotation and class overall?<br />
Yes, those are getting baked in. Simplifies and lessens rampup a bit. Diseases serve to do damage, that's unchanged. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425373200143220736))<br />
Are you concerned about the return of diseaseless rotations?<br />
Not really. We've majorly buffed diseases since those were a thing. We'll fix it if it ever seems optimal. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425374182650556417))<br />
might seem likely that frost might move to a single disease rotation unless blood plague becomes more attractive.<br />
Yeah, that'd be the one that got dropped if any do. We'll make sure that it doesn't happen unintentionally. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425490034213396480))<br />
what is blood's motivation to use frost fever? (Could have missed a passive that boosts it)<br />
Damage/Threat, and the fact that it's freely applied with Outbreak, and freely maintained with Scarlet Fever. Very low opp cost. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425855880760791040))<br />
<br />
What is the plan for multistrike concerning attacks that don't deal direct damage like Necrotic strike ?<br />
I don't recall offhand if Necrotic's debuff stacks. If so, that solves it automatically. If not, may have to do something. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425302851393314816))<br />

Was Thrash intended to be part of Ferals single target toolbox? For WoD will you attempt to discourage its use in single target?<br />
It's a minor DPS gain to use on OoC procs, which we're fine with. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425312517120733184))<br />
<br />
For Eclipse states only, not anything else. Feral will retain the same thing with Tiger's Fury.<br />
Yeah. Eclipse and Tiger's Fury will be snapshotted. Things like int procs will not be. Extension by X sec, not X ticks. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425302418377539584))<br />
So basically if I crit with Starfire outside Eclipse the DoT is extended and is calculated by current stats?<br />
Extending doesn't change damage. Damage always uses current stats, except for Eclipse state which is saved at cast time (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425305429514522624))<br />

Fire mage with shatter is kinda 'unfinished' design since doesn't have enough novas for constant DPS support. So whatever you do,<br />
Mages were one of the first classes redesigned in MoP with goal of sharing more across specs. Certainly hurt spec identity. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/425840949617381376))<br />

Any plans for a WW statue for monks in WoD? We feel left out!<br />
Totally depends on if we have something that would fit well for a statue to do for them. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425858135413116928))<br />
<br />
Are you guys happy with WW Monk's Sparring? It just feels too random and annoying for both the Monk and his opponents.<br />
It was originally intended to be a significant gameplay impactor, but turned out to be much weaker than intended. May revise. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425301119259013120))<br />

Any plans to improve spriest single target for 6.0 regardless of spec? Buff MF with an extra ticks/cast perhaps?<br />
Yes, we have a plan to allow Shadow Priests to specialize more in how they focus/spread their damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426453135947620357))<br />
<br />
Spriests are doing okay on Malkorok thanks to ABUSING close to 100% uptime on ToF. 15% increase and we still suck. PI Baseline!<br />
That's not abusing. That's the intended use of Twist of Fate. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425849098567041024))<br />
Whoa, whoa, hold on there. The intended use of Twist of Fate is to cheat into ways to have it up 100%? Seriously?<br />
The intended use of Twist of Fate is to maximize its uptime. That should be fairly obvious. There are many ways to do that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426074307899322368))<br />
Sure, but I'm trying to understand why tanks standing in fire for Vengeance is bad and spriests locking themselves at 20% isn't.<br />
SPriests locking themselves at 20% is just one way to do it, and a not the ideal one. Definitely not what you should do with a PUG (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426125552370470912))<br />
<br />
This sounds flipping awful for raiding. DA is already a huge, HUGE issue in healing right now, and this..is more?<br />
I think you must have misunderstood something. This isn't something that makes DA relatively stronger. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425295063292182528))<br />
Pretty sure Tiriel is trying to say the game does not need more things to proc DA.<br />
Right, and that's not the case here. This isn't causing more DA. It just isn't causing any less DA. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425304219017433088))<br />
It definitely would be an additional source of DA. It might not be a lot more DA but it would be more none the less.<br />
Again, misunderstanding. It's a stat that you trade other stats for. If you trade crit for MS, your DA goes down. Any other, equal (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425310174065094656))<br />
It's still another -source- of DA. It's something else that can result in bubbles.<br />
Talking past each other. 100heal+30DA vs 50heal+15DA+50heal+15DA. Same net result. 'Count' of DA sources doesn't matter. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425340312194527232))<br />
We do not -need- another source of DA. I don't care if it &quot;evens out.&quot; We have too many sources of the damn thing as is!<br />
What I'm saying is that you're imagining a relation to a different problem. This is 100% unrelated to DA. No effect on DA prob. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425341890192363520))<br />
Wouldn't more -sources- of DA give more opportunity for DA bubbles to be created? Because each heal event is a separate roll?<br />
Opportunities, sure. But that *really doesn't matter*. Really. You're trading one 5k DA for two 2k DAs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425343431255146496))<br />
But it's more people with absorbs on them.<br />
Still doesn't matter. I promise you. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425343822499811328))<br />
<br />
You're missing the point. Disc with crit stacked now = lots of DAs. Disc with crit and MS in WoD = tons of DAs.<br />
False. Utterly false. [Disc with Crit and MS] = *less* DA than [Disc with pure Crit].This *reduces* the amount of DA. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425342929096290304))<br />
<br />
You guys said you'd monitor DS/Halo, and then you just didn't bother to change it. You are the ones who let Disc go nuts.<br />
Yes, and that was a big mistake. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425341407952248832))<br />
<br />
-don't see a problem with the overwhelming amount of DA, or that it's shutting healers out, and making the game unfun.<br />
I don't? I've been really clear that it's the opposite. It *is* a problem. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425341333721468928))<br />
<br />
What do you think of a Shadow Crash style AoE shadow orb finisher for SPriests? (idea by Yvaelle). http://t.co/p0b8eLDncG<br />
Shadow doesn't have an AoE generator, so having an AoE spender might be odd. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425298952557039618))<br />

Are you happy with how affliction works now ? many locks miss multidoting and SB and hate Malefic Grasp. 35% haunt kills dots.<br />
Not sure how any Affliction Warlocks can 'miss' multidotting... It really hasn't gone anywhere. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426110218259292160))<br />
<br />
Were you prepared for the extent of (or did you underestimate) the outcry unleased when you nerfed Kilj'aedens Cunning?<br />
Yes. We knew that its users would be unhappy, but also knew that is was for the best, and that the pros outweighed the cons. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425851468164251648))<br />
How do you plan to nerf the current amazing state of warlocks for WoD (in terms of their toolkit) without causing said uproar?<br />
We haven't started giving out class change details yet. But it should be obvious that the DoT snapshotting change is huge. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425853550992687104))<br />

Why does readiness affecting cd sof warrior's talent abilities but not other classes? Is this still the case in WoD?<br />
Warriors talent into more of their CDs, and have a whole row of CD talents. Readiness can affect a whole row without imbalance. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426419809815769088))<br />
what about hunter's 90 talent? not affected by the AoC<br />
Hunters had enough benefit to AoC without it. With Readiness in 6.0, we can tune the rating coefficient so that we can affect those. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426424703897440256))<br />
so readiness will be a complicated stat that no general rule to tell which ability will be affeted?<br />
It will be the same complication as Mastery. Similar passive in spellbook and character sheet that details what it affects by spec. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/426429678140682240))<br />
<br />
You're not planning to mess with fury come WOD, are you? It plays perfect now, would hate to see any major changes.<br />
Fury is generally in a good place. It'll need a bit of change to make Haste valuable, but that shouldn't feel unnatural. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425296445080469504))<br />
I don't like how drastic it changes with gear in play style. It's so crit or bust.<br />
Part of we want to do is balance the value of secondary stats better. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/425672198108356609))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
New GPUs from AMD are here, at least on paper. Finding any AMD GPUs is hard now, as is finding some of the Nvidia GPUs. Prices for many GPUs went up due to demand and the older GPUs being discontinued. <br />
<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/february/ssdgraph.gif) are stable, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. <br />
<br />
The Haswell CPUs (http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1) run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A). <br />

Mid and higher end AMD GPUs aren't in stock anywhere, or if they are the prices are far too high. This makes Nvidia the only choice for most builds right now.<br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

They could have made a more fitting mount to fit the theme which isnt really the orc home world as much as the army Garrosh has built.

Spend the extra money you've saved on a Corsair HX750 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0090I9VZI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0090I9VZI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dextstwit-20) modular PS. I've only built one PC recently without a modular to save money and I can't stress enough how much easier building is with a modular PS and is worth the extra money. Also keep in mind while the WD 1TB Black is 99 you can buy this Seagate 3TB for 109.99 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00829THQE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00829THQE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dextstwit-20) and rip the drive out of it's shell. If that scares you, you can pick up just the bare drive for 5 dollars more. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005T3GRLY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005T3GRLY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dextstwit-20) Now you're paying 15 dollars more for 3x the space.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this is all linked to Amazon, if you shop around you can get better deals. The HX750 is only 129.99, and I would HIGHLY suggest the AsRock Extreme4 which is 144.99 on Newegg as well, both come with free shipping. These PC parts just aren't wise selections for the money, especially the Unicorn, and only 4GB for the puppy? C'mon now that's just a poor decision all around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should never just buy 1 more stick... <br />
<br />
Dual Channel (Quad Channel) is too fast to just pass it, sure you can Triple Channel on Intel but since we are talking about AMD CPU's, those don't have Triple Channel.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should separate PC's for people that OC and those that don't, getting a Z87 board and a Intel CPU with a Free multiplier is pretty useless for people that will never overclock, you could also use the boxed heat sink if you don't OC.<br />
<br />
I build a PC for my girl that has a Xeon 1230v3 with the boxed heatsink and a Gigabyte H87-D3H just because i know she will never touch the hardware.<br />
<br />
A 750W PSU for the Unicorn system is a bit much... If you don't run a double GPU there is no way in hell you need more then 550W~,<br />
a good PSU with 35-40A on the 12V output is more then enough.<br />
<br />
I also would never touch AsRock again.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure why it's only limited to Amazon then, I'm guessing just because of revenue but directing people to a lesser quality product that's more expensive instead of just suggesting it can be found cheaper on Newegg and that Amazon pricing is so high. <br />

Everyone has an opinion of a hard drive company, I've had multiple WD Black drives have performance issues and MANY WD drives just flat out die on me. I've been running one of the shelled Seagates and *knock on wood* it's still working awesome and as fast as the day I bought it.<br />
<br />
True but even recommending it is a poor choice, 8GB for the two low end and 16GB for the top ends is the safest choice, but again that's just my opinion a lot of people love to run with just 8GB and swear they don't need more. Running just my system and WoW I can cap over 8GB easily but never go above 10.<br />
<br />
I have an Asus Z68 Pro and my wife has the Extreme4 and while my Asus does have a thicker PCB like you mentioned (you can tell a noticeable difference) but that wouldn't stray me away from the E4 and the value of it is just too much to pass up, it really is an awesome board and I highly recommend it unless you're jumping to a ROG series.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Rosewill Fortress is as good or better, just lacks modular cables. Amazon is used because it is worldwide. <br />
<br />
H90 reviews are more mixed than I thought, but here are 2 that show it worse. In the rare case it starts leaking, it is a hassle (http://www.overclock.net/t/1300669/corsair-h100-leaked-onto-my-brand-new-graphics-card-and-motherboard) to get the damaged parts replaced and they don't really have to replace them under that warranty, just the cooler. Even if it does work better, it isn't really worth it for most people. <br />

I was recently looking at the Seagate 3TB for a workstation build. The storage per dollar is unbeatable. But it's listed as a backup drive because that's exactly what it's good for. You pop it in, back up your files, then throw it in a cabinet until you need to retrieve those files. It got goodreviews from people who use it for its intended purpose, but it got horrid reviews from people who bought it as an everyday drive. If you buy it expecting to keep games on it, expect to buy a replacement within a year.</div></div><hr />

As in all things your mileage may vary. If I had to weigh in I would say get a Hybrid SSHD, which yes, are made exclusively by Seagate. Unless you're regularly doing writes &gt; 8GB, capacity to performance ratio is just going to kick the bejeezus out of anything else, and the prices are very competitive.</div></div><hr />

A: RNG actually has relatively little effect on total DPS over a whole fight. How you respond to that RNG is bigger though.<br />
<br />
That is bull the difference between getting good trinket and proc uptime and average or below average uptime is HUGE. I done 350k single target dps on a boss one week and then the next week I done 438k dps and ranked 4th in my class with zero new gear upgrades. The only difference was I got bad trinket and proc rng the first week and awesome rng the second week. Devs have no clue what they're even talking about.</div></div><hr />

It has the animations of the proto-drakes, just like the fire hawks and pterodactyl mounts. They might change a couple of things with the skeleton, but it's still a stupid proto-drake mount. <br />

Blizzard really does not seem to understand &quot;fun&quot; game play any more. From their moronic bullshit &quot;Less is More&quot; PR crap in D3 to this display of hubris on the warlock KJC talent. They really do seem lost.<br />
<br />
They remind me of the once cool kid in high school who 20 years later is still telling the same jokes, still dressing the same and still thinks he/she is relevant and cool. <br />
They used to get away with the obnoxious hubris because of the amount of content in their game, the excellent game play and the involving storyline. <br />
No longer, they've been concentrating on the bottom line for so long now they have forgotten how to make engaging games.<br />

You may keep telling both yourself and other posters this, but repetition simply does not make it true. This mount uses the proto-drake skeleton (just as the original Raven Lord uses a raptor skeleton). I personally hate the proto-drake skeletal animations/renderings and simply adding feathers and a sprinkle of nostalgia to an (again in my opinion) ugly base skeleton does not an amazing mount make. I had such high hopes for this Dread Raven mount, and I was even considering buying the Collector's Edition for the first time in my WoW career; that is no longer the case.</div></div><hr />

Dude, it's not a Proto-drake! It's build upon the skeleton of the Armored Skyscreamer they introduced with the Isle/Throne of Thunder.</div></div><hr />

Except it's not. It takes a lot of mental gymnastics to think it's another protodrake.</div></div><hr />

It looks too sickly as a result and makes me think that if Rob Liefeld drew for Blizz, this is the sort of obfuscated design he would produce. If I were still playing WoW, however, I think the mount would warrant picking up the CE (I passed on a CE for the first time in MoP as I find the quilien to be hideous). Not the greatest-looking design but they've done much worse.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I don't know about that. I mean, it doesn't look like a twisted, mannequin-like Mantid with strange, puffed lips and it's even got feet rather than its talons being perpetually hidden in convenient smoke. And it's completely lacking pouches!<br />
<br />
But I do agree with you. With the frayed feathers, the how the animations seem unmatched to the model and that hunched walk it does look like it's sickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yet it has a different feel, a different stance and different animations than a protodrake. Therefore it really is different although it may have its skeleton as a base. Despite its skeleton-origin it still looks great imo.</div></div><hr />

The 4670K, yes. In almost every game it will be on par with the 4770K.</div></div><hr />
