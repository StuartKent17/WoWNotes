Patch 5.2 - Ra-den Audio<br />
Ra-den is the Heroic difficulty only boss found in the Throne of Thunder raid. There is still nothing about him in the Dungeon Journal, other than the little bit of lore.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;object width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/1gU6_5OIk60?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/1gU6_5OIk60?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br />
<br />
Shrouded in Mystery - There are no scholars with any recollection or record regarding the details of Ra-den's powers. Perhaps these memories have been obscured by the passage of time, or perhaps none who saw the Keeper of Storms in battle ever lived to speak of what they witnessed....<br />
<br />
Lei Shen's life changed forever when he stumbled into a dark chamber below what are now the Mogu'shan Vaults. Legend has it he found an ancient titan keeper guarding a miraculous device known as the Engine of Nalak'sha. No one knows what transpired between the two beings, but Lei Shen later emerged from the site bristling with the power to forge an empire. The keeper's fate -- and his current whereabouts -- remain a mystery.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
You succeeded at Active mitigation - avoidance is by definition passive mitigation - regretting the change?<br />
Nope. We think active mitigation is more fun. Just need to decide what to do about dodge and parry long term. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294581587620810752))<br />
<br />
Items with spirit on it. Holy vs disc vs shadow - which spec gets priority in your opinion? Causing gearing issues ATM.<br />
IMO it doesn't matter that much. Too many healers think they must have Spirit in every single slot and they really don't. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294502706557640704))<br />
That said, we think the whole Spirit to hit thing is awkward and we'd like to come up with a better solution in a future expansion. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294502834119000065))<br />
<br />
Long term, are &quot;pure&quot; dps classes here to stay, or are you guys evaluating other options?<br />
We talk about it often. I'm not sure all those pures would want to be hybrids though. Not as simple as oh just ignore that role. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294106474555265026))<br />
For the pures that want, it's a plus. For the pures that don't, they can deal with it just like all other classes<br />
Maybe they picked pure so they wouldn't have to deal with it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294143098265669632))<br />
<br />
Tanks are still number 1 DPS for like all fights. It's a bit frustraiting as a DPS to not be able to compete. Concerns?<br />
Can you name a specific fight? Dungeon? Raid? Happens on Mel'jarak because of the fight. Not common elsewhere. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294104201892618241))<br />
<br />
you are going to have to listen to the people playing the class and not all the ones playing everything else.<br />
But the people playing the class are the most likely to think excessive buffs are reasonable. The others have a different pov. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293831179130507264))<br />
the others have the pov that no nerf is ever enough.<br />
That can happen. It's really hard to have the objectivity to recognize the difference between overpowered and outplayed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294101957071745024))<br />
<br />
Anyway you can balance out all the class specs so that there are no more FOTM specs? No best DPS spec, no best Healing, etc.<br />
We try. There's math and then there are player reactions and we try to balance the two. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293439343459192833))<br />
<br />
So pls stop making drastic changes to mage pve spec,tired of having to regem/spec/test/learn a new rotation every month. <br />
The alternative is all the players who love X spec just can't play it. Not sure how to solve both. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293434165704151040))<br />
<br />
Theorycrafting ruined the game, it made everyone elitist and most specs &quot;nonviable&quot; because they do 5% less DPS.<br />
No objections to theorycrafting overall. It's when stack ranks of DPS are offered as fact that it causes more harm than good. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293432755759484928))<br />
<br />
So you're more concerned with representation than balance?<br />
There is often a relationship. Balance is not the only thing that drives population, but it contributes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293427492025409536))<br />

btw does it not seem overpowered that feral has passive movement, slow, and can shift slow/root? rhetorical question<br />
Broadly speaking, we think the game is better when classes have powerful pros but also some cons rather than all mediocrity. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293078940250165248))<br />

there aren't many changes to hunters in the 5.2 patch notes so far, would I be wrong to assume MM won't get the buff it needs?<br />
The change buffed MM's damage. Can you explain how far you think they are behind with the change? (Raidbots can't answer this.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293786211196223489))<br />

At the highest RNG, Fire is okay. On average RNG, Fire sucks, and by sucks, I mean it's ridiculously low.<br />
Raidbots suggests the standard deviation of both specs is pretty close. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294104793075552257))<br />
<br />
Why such a severe nerf to Rune of Power as Arcane? Seems to kill the effort vs. reward of having to stay in the same spot.<br />
Trying to balance reward for using it correctly against penalty in those times when you can't. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294099341503782913))<br />
<br />
You forgot to answer his question. Tho, reading between the lines, looks like the answer is &quot;switch to arcane&quot;<br />
Think I've said many times that Arcane is a bit high because Scorch lets them sit on 6 stacks all the time. Not our intent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294096161411842048))<br />
<br />
So, our damage is too high, but other classes like Affliction Locks that do more damage than Arcane is fine?<br />
Pretty sure I've said several times that Affliction is too high too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294094800637001729))<br />

BTW, what are the reasons to try and remove haste from prot pallies?<br />
&quot;WTF Bliz? Why put dodge on our tier sets. I'll just use Ret set.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294508651668971520))<br />
<br />
no offense, but you guys knew about Haste and Prot Paladins since well before live.<br />
At the time we thought it was an undergeared problem because dodge doesn't matter when failing a dodge kills you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294237921484087296))<br />
We still sort of suspect that's the problem but it's become such a mantra that it's worth changing anyway. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294238137599815680))<br />
<br />
Too gauche? So why warriors can (not used) carry daggers? It is a symbol of clumsiness as Ghostcrawler.<br />
I think warriors will use any weapon but prefer the bigger ones. Paladins shun daggers for some code reason. Shrug. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294104007012671493))<br />
<br />
will you give back Ret paladins their divine purpose?<br />
Unlikely. Despite the good arguments we hear, we're convinced many Rets would complain about forcing RNG on them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293436992581148672))<br />
<br />
you talked about nerfing ret burst and buffing sustained dmg/mechanics. What happended to that idea?<br />
We don't think the reaction from Ret players would be good overall. Would have to weigh that cost. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293430677829976065))<br />

We have to cast PW:S 3 times every 12 seconds to net the same mana Rapture does, and it has to be effective healing.<br />
Rapture isn't supposed to be a mana generation tool. It's to offset PW:S cost. Disc mana needs a nerf on live. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293433464689139712))<br />
<br />
Why does Shadow need to be nerfed? We haven't even seen PvP on 5.2. Premature.<br />
We get very little PvP participation on PTRs. Mostly it's players theorizing about what changes mean (which is still useful). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293433218827427840))<br />
<br />
For disc priests, do you think removing DA when PoH overheals rather than removing it entirely will be a better solution?<br />
Potentially, but sometimes you want the bubble when everyone is full because big damage is incoming. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293078037199736833))<br />

hi i know you are a busy man but have you taken any time to think about buffing rogues we suck thanks<br />
We think they have been buffed in 5.2 a whole lot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293076040216096768))<br />
Rogue buffing the result of ineffectiveness or population decline or both?<br />
I've talked before about how DPS didn't seem to affect population in this particular case. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293830996288233472))<br />

Rogues get a bit of love in 5.2,but what if history holds and their pop still doesnt grow.What will be your next step if any?<br />

Well, that's kind of the point. Why have Hamstring cost rage if that cost is irrelevant? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294143678803496960))<br />

Does it make sense to you that a Mage can Blink out of a Stun but a warriors second wind shouldn't work?<br />
The difference is the Blink is used once and then you can respond. There's no way to stop a SW unless you can out DPS it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294106116785332224))<br />

Again nerfing warr's every 5 minutes after over a year of being gimped isn't a good fix, its no wonder people don't trust you.<br />
I'm not sure if people trust me or not. I'm also not sure if that's important. Would be an interesting discussion. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293436693401436160))<br />

Character<br />
So many ilvls of each piece + reforge + gems, enchants, enhances is making gear overwhelming. Too many choices/variables<br />
Ignoring the damage it might do to professions, would you miss gemming and enchanting? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294165683401523200))<br />
<br />
Ever feel like there's too much focus on math in WoW? Reforging, DPS, HPS... numbers are too important. Not sure how to fix.<br />
Players are really scared of being wrong, even if the delta is trivial. Much more likely to experiment in a single player game. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293437742333980673))<br />
<br />
I'm more concerned that the meta gem AH market will crash if most get free legendary metas.<br />
Nobody said they were free. Nobody said they didn't cost metagems.... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294511160642912256))<br />
<br />
MoP seems to be harsher towards multiclass players. I know 'you don't have to do all your dailies', but to go to raids...<br />
I think that's fair, but in the previous expansion players with one main ran out of stuff to do very quickly. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294506078908076032))<br />
<br />
Am I the only one who feels that they have the solution to separating PvE gear and PvP gear COMPLETELY from each other?<br />
We wanted to have some overlap. However, current design seems to be having an even greater effect in the opposite direction. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294504861372923904))<br />
<br />
Very much agree. Those &quot;BiS lists&quot; irritate me.<br />
I think knowing which item is your best piece is fine. That then gets turned into anything which is not that piece is &quot;garbage.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294167797372698625))<br />
<br />
Do you intend to balance the tier set bonuses to ensure tier is better than off-set Thunderforged (which is +6 ilvls)?<br />
Not sure. I sort of miss the days when players would take non-tier seriously if the stats were good enough. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294142658530660352))<br />
What days do you speak of? It was more like when set stat allocation was bad in addition to bad set bonuses.<br />
It was also hard to complete sets. Some players had them, others had good stats to make up for the lack of the set. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294166733676244993))<br />
<br />
Have you guys thought about balancing racials a little better?It feels like no one really plays tauren,or gnome; human better<br />
While I won't claim racials are perfect, I think what you are seeing is about graphics not racials. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294105814560550912))<br />
<br />
Tell me you are changing the tier 15 set bonuses for H Paladins. I don't want to nearly skip a tier and go from 517 to t15 hc.<br />
We could have no set bonuses on T15 and you'd still want to upgrade because of the stats unless T14 is ridiculously over budget. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293078286102298624))<br />
<br />
No,actually,there is not a wrong choice.Wether we(players) buy new items OR upgrade old ones should be our decision,not DEV's.<br />
Giving players the ability to make choices with wrong answers doesn't make players happy overall. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293077385518133249))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
This mostly affects the first wave of guilds tackling the encounters. I'm just curious if it's taken into account.<br />
We balance the new tier with that ilevel in mind. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/292735817540050944))<br />
<br />
Love the idea of the conquest catchup mechanism. Any chance we can see something similar implemented for Valor?<br />
We like the idea for Valor too but want to see how it shakes out for Conquest first. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/292388297198678016))<br />
<br />
What do you think about including some Lesser Charms of Good Fortune in the LFR consolation bag?<br />
As we said in some of the 5.1 interviews, we plan on putting some better goodies in the consolation bag. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/292076908743639040))<br />
<br />
Hey can you verify if the change in 5.2 to the 'failbag' will apply to 5.0 and 5.1 LFRs too? Or just the 5.2 LFR?<br />
I can't yet. Definitely for 5.2 and 5.0 if we have time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293079716657774593))<br />
<br />
Is Thunderforging the NA/EU equivalent/response to higher ilvl on Asian servers?<br />
Asia will have Thunderforged too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294143464902361088))<br />
<br />
I like the concept of the 'thunderforged' items, but dont let them drop while the world 1st race is on. I think its important.<br />
Weapons drop (or don't) on the world first race right now and those are a bigger swing than 6 ilevels. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294581935441850369))<br />
<br />
I didn't see you guys reaching out to solve our problems, but you appear to work awfully hard to create incentives for 25s<br />
While I am sorry for your individual situation, overall 10s are growing and 25s are shrinking. We don't like that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294266888828112897))<br />
fix to the issue of raid sizes, remove both make 15m baseline also remove fiscal cost of server transfers<br />
You are asking every raider in the world to grow their roster by 50% or prune 10 people. Feels pretty harsh. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294510425427558401))<br />
<br />
I recommend either a)collapsing to one raid size, b) going back to the Wrath model of decisive difficulty diff, or c) equality<br />
A) Would be very cruel to all. B) Potentially, but cruel to 10s. C) Close to today, which feels cruel to 25s. No easy answers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294266332726317056))<br />
<br />
Not to sound ignorant, but why don't you like people migrating from 25s to 10s? If ppl like 25 its its own reward<br />
We don't buy that 10s are just more fun. Throughout WoW, one constant is that players gravitate towards efficiency. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294503629409366016))<br />
<br />
My guild lacks enough players to continue 25s, so we are forced to do 10s. But doesn't it look to you like we just like 10s?<br />
Yes, and that's a problem. 10s are very unlikely to become 25s but the opposite happens all the time. Entropy. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294095633470603264))<br />
<br />
Instead of 'Thunderforged' why don't you just have items that drop that are consumed to upgrade items instead of VP? Simpler.<br />
We want killing bosses on farm to stay exciting because of the chance of dropping a better item. Hard for tokens to be exciting. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294265559044988928))<br />
<br />
With this proposed Thunderforged idea, don't you think the iLevel focus and range is really getting out of hand?<br />
It's 6 ilevels. We're not going to reach ilevel 1000 in this expansion. It may feel weird, but it still functions. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294168113082163200))<br />
I'm sure there was a reason for this, but why have TF items vs simply having items occasionally drop 1/2 upg already?<br />
If we do upgrading in 5.3, then the drops become less exciting again because pre-upgraded not better than anything. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294174320442351616))<br />
<br />
I am confused. You say we(players) consume content too fast? Yet 5.2 is making current content obselete after what 4 months??<br />
&quot;Consume&quot; doesn't mean complete. In this context it means &quot;finish.&quot; Can be done with a raid even if you haven't cleared it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294165298960027649))<br />
<br />
If LFR is meant to be the primary source of gearing up for a new raid tier, will lower LFR tiers get a higher chance for gear?<br />
Yes. I think we improved drop chance, charm chance and made it easier to get charms. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/294105318596698113))<br />
<br />
Any reason for the 5 dungeon per hour per account lockout? Could we at least double it? 5 is too low a # for low lvl dungeons<br />
It's to discourage exploits. Do you really need to enter a new dungeon every 10 min? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293438053920407552))<br />
<br />
How come asian servers have 10/25 lockout seperately like WOTLK and have better ilvl for 25 man yet we dont on EU/NA?<br />
Letting players play more isn't always a slam dunk. Witness current dailies debate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293435755315990529))<br />
Much more controversial in NA/EU. Heard from many that ICC felt too much like a job. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293435660600242176))<br />
<br />
I'm excited about the PvP gear changes in 5.2. If the catch up feature works well can we expect to see it for PvE?<br />
If it works well in PvP we'll definitely consider it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/293434752898314240))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/february/ssdgraph.gif) seem to have bottomed out for now, with almost all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte. This is the first month in a long time that there have been no amazing SSD sales. No new CPUs, GPUs, or SSDs worth waiting for are expected before the second quarter this year.<br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 3770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

I actually don't think he was a miniboss in ZG (despite what some person posted in the comments). If I remember correctly, he was the quest giver for warriors when ZG was a lvl 60 raid instance. He gave out the gear for different reputation lvls (I could be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure it was him).</div></div><hr />

He wasn't a miniboss. He was a good guy. He was part of the Zandalar faction sent to Yojamba Isle and gave the plate armor rep items to warriors and paladins (&quot;heathens&quot;, as he called them).<br />
<br />
Makes me miss it even more. I wish there were SOME Zandalar out there not being turned into convenient loot pinatas.</div></div><hr />

As a note, I am noticing a very big theme of the Titans' fail safe procedures are pretty much going out of their way to annihilate life on Azeroth and reset it all back to zero. It makes you wonder if the Titan's really want to keep Azeroth around anymore if half the things (Outside of the aspects) want to demolish the planet in a desperate attempt to get rid of the Old Gods and Burning Legion influence on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that people get bent out of shape when anything troll related comes out, or similar models are used in a raid. None of the battles seem to be rehashed to be honest, they really do try to go all out with weird encounters when they do troll instances. I do like the ideas they have for this one as well as the idea of a titan fail-safe seeming to outright snap. I do hope to see what the Ra-den encounter will be like and to see how this one fits in to the grander scheme of the expansion.<br />

Nah. I don't know anything about them, but if they are good quality that is really not that bad. My dad is a huge audiophile and has paid way more than $230 for a set of headphones. As long as you do some research, you aren't going to get gypped. If I still gamed as much as I used to, I could see myself paying good money for a quality headset. Different people have different hobbies and junk they spend their money on. :)</div></div><hr />

Yep.. once you had really good cans on your head, it's very hard to enjoy music with cheap gear. I always cringe when my dad listens to music via his laptop speakers &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

Want to call me a sucker too?<br />
Some people just happen to enjoy quality equipment and good sound, be it in games or music.<br />
(Not judging if the Astros are worth it or not, didn't read any reviews)<br />
<br />
Yeah, no. I personally don't believe that's a reasonable amount to spend on headphones. From a cost-to-benefit perspective, I just can't see it. Nor can I see it from a tech-cost perspective. Why's it cost so much? Does it contain exotic materials? Is it like CPUs where they mass produce speakers in batches and then test them, so the ones with the best dynamic range or whatever go into these high-end headsets? <br />
<br />
I find it far more likely that it's more about status than anything else. &quot;I have Astro a40s so clearly I am serious about my gaming.&quot; It's even hard to trust reviews when either the reviewer is a shill for the company or it's some poor bastard who's already bought them and will say anything to convince himself that he didn't just waste a couple hundred bucks. <br />
<br />
Of course, everyone is entitled to their opinions. It's your money so buy whatever makes you happy.</div></div><hr />

Don't go comparing Bayerdynamic to this plastic fantastic crap on top, please be so good. It's like going ten levels higher and comparing BOSE (http://www.bose.com/controller?event=VIEW_STATIC_PAGE_EVENT&amp;url=/index_2.jsp) speakers to Avantgarde (http://www.avantgarde-acoustic.com/home.html) speakers, one is utter overpriced crap, whilst the other is expensive yet offers unbelievable audio quality unmatched by many if at all - same with your headphones.<br />
<br />
The guy is right in his first post (ignore his post above mine, he never experienced quality sound on headphones most likely), $200 for the headphones when you can get SONY, Bayerdynamic, Sennheisser and similar headphones for the same price (which perform a lot better sans the microphone) is wasted money. And let's be serious here, for gaming all you need is a 2.- EUR microphone and it will sound great. <br />
<br />
You wouldn't like a Yugo to cost the same as a BMW 7 series either would you? :D<br />

<br />
You are entitled to your opinion of course, however if we buy expensive quality headphones (not the ones in a giveaway) doesn't mean we only use them on the PC. I can't blare music through the speakers of my system every day or at any given point in time of the day, since I'm not alone in my house and sometimes people like it quiet or watch TV without music blaring through the speakers and well that's when quality headphones come into play. <br />
<br />
For PC usage I used all kinds of 15EUR - 50EUR headphones long time, until i realized, I got those pro headphones hooked to my system in the living room, might as well use them on the PC, since the cheap headphones fell apart about one year of usage. So from that point on, I use the same headphones on for everything. <br />
<br />
Tho I will admit, prices in the audio department tend to rise quite high for good stuff. Not for everyone, but I will tell you, you notice the difference a lot - it's also not that quality stuff breaks every two years. I'm with my headphones now for the 5th year and they're still as new.</div></div><hr />

I didn't. I explicitly stated that I don't know whether the Astros are worth the price or not. (They look like cheap bling to me though)<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
High end audio gear contains exotic materials, use VERY durable casings. These cans I linked? Some people used the previous model for 20years+ and only changed the paddings once or twice (20$).<br />
Also there are incredibly high R&amp;D costs involved. Coupled with the fact that Beyerdynamic produces these cans using manual labor in Germany and not in China etc.<br />
<br />
As for the sound quality: You can argue all you want, it won't help you much. You need to have babies like these on your head and listen to your favorite music to get what the audiophile fuss is all about.<br />

Agreed. If you get a decent Soundcard (http://asia.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=1&amp;subcategory=874&amp;product=19749), you even get very nice sound on your PC. No need for a big stereo.<br />
<br />
<br />

I'd love to try out Beyers T1. But I have to be honest though: as an untrained listener, I doubt I'd would be able to appreciate cans of that magnitude. Besides.. can't plug in 600Ω into a soundcard anymore. (running 250Ω now) :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why does unicorn not have 2x120gb SSD in RAID 0<br />
<br />
Why completely cheese on the sound? Onboard sound and Z523 for a great gaming rig? Should be at least a good soundcard and Z623 or the surround ones for unicorn and Z623 for narwhal. Just doesn´t make sense to buy a sweet new computer and then have 80´s ghetto blaster sound. Z623 with a THX certified sound card and you have amazing sound for films as well.<br />
<br />
Also only 8GB ram in Unicorn?<br />
<br />
Some of the choices baffle me.</div></div><hr />

I'd suggest to refer to TechReports upgrade/build advisors instead of trusting some random gaming site.<br />
<br />
<br />

Most people still have it stuck in their head that computer sound is always bad and just can't realize that these times are long gone. Ofc if you slap on El-cheapo Logitech speakers onan onboard... you bring these times right back into your living room. :D<br />
<br />
PS: 8GB is more than enough for gaming. You only need more when you run multiple VMs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But even Logitech has speakers that are much better than the suggested ones. I think the last part is more correct. Just look at Unicorn. No raid 0, way to expensive mainboard, onboard sound, Overkill CPU, crappy speakers, only 8gb ram (yes more is actually nice)<br />
<br />

Lets be fair: He at least informs people about that stuff.<br />

At the highest RNG, Fire is okay. On average RNG, Fire sucks, and by sucks, I mean it's ridiculously low.<br />
Raidbots suggests the standard deviation of both specs is pretty close. (Source)<br />
