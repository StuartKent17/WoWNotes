<br />
Yeah, this would put shamans back in line because they are currently totally overpowered in PvP. Not only would you destroy 4 seconds totem casting and 600 Mana (or so) with just an AoE, or multitargetspells which you would cast anyway. And in PvE this wouldn't be noticable at all. On top of my head I can't remember more then one or two bosses in SSC, TK, BT, Hyjal with AoE effects.<br />
<br />
(How you got the idea that the physical/magical school stuff will change anything in this regard, remains a mystery to me as well)</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes let's just make totems that much easier to kill then they already are. not only do they only have 5 hp...now you can kill 3 of them at the same time. =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't look like you even have the slightest clue what a spell school is.<br />
The only change is that when you're locked in a spell school or silenced you can still cast totems and when you switch weapons in combat your totem spells will have a global cooldown as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To elaborate on this: this is a change to the spell that summons the totem, not the totem itself. The totem is a separate entity with it's own stats and immunities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are very decent in 2v2, 3v3, and popular in 5v5. They have just been buffed small scale pvp, yes druids are better...but we're all in the same boat behind them.<br />
<br />
Shamans are the number one sought after class in PvE.<br />
<br />
What on earth is all the complaining about?<br />
<br />
<br />
Shamans can be incredibly strong, its just far too complicated for the face-rolling masses out there to appreciate. In short, as the top pvp shamans in the world, and even the designers have stated, L2P.<br />
<br />
If you cant understand the tactical use of totems, shocks, shields and ghostwolf now, whats the point of getting more goodies? You want an iwin ability that you can spam so you arent forced to realise how bad you are.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daneel</div><div class="date">2008-06-10, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are really good in pve because of the recent changes to raiding, raid wide dmg in most encounters, as single target healers they are nothing special.<br />
In pvp, shamans are really easy to lock down, although not as much as paladins so this buff is really justified.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't be so sure about the 'castable while silenced' bit. I play a warrior as my main and we have a lot of physical spells - all our shouts and taunts and thunderclap - and NONE of them are castable while silenced.</div></div><hr />

That's because they are not classified as physical spells (and in case of the shouts it makes sense). TC used to be nature, don't know what it is now.</div></div><hr />

Seeing how kitty form has a 1.00 attack speed, I doubt windfury would be much use to them. It might help feral tanks but I've never heard anything on bear druids having threat issues. . .</div></div><hr />

Indeed. Lionshark Productions is also a pretty good machinima group producing some pretty cool work such as &quot;The Hunt&quot; (http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=78383). The other two grand prize winners were pretty lame and bland.</div></div><hr />

Wpn speed doesn't matter for windfury totems, they don't have the 3 sec cooldown that self buff windfury has, so attack speed doesn't matter at all.</div></div><hr />

I'm trying to recall an instance when I silenced and I really had to drop a totem right there and then. It's really not that big of a change. I'd much rather they increased the HP on at least some of the totems. Mana Tide for example. It's infinitely stupid that some ability that's deep in a tree, is on a 5-minute cooldown and is so vital for a class can literally be one-shotted by a level 1 char! It's just plain dumb.<br />
<br />
Btw, we're talking strictly PvP, nothing in PvE destroys your Mana Tide before it ticks. I understand that you can do all sorts of tricks to hide your Mana Tide (or other totems for that matter), but at least get rid of the huge swirling wave thing. Goddamn! It just shouts &quot;KILL ME.&quot;</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter that it wouldn't have that large of an effect, at least it would be something to help out our dps when we are in a melee group since shaman will be dropping that over grace of air for the rogues and warriors.</div></div><hr />

Which is still better to have then nothing.</div></div><hr />

Yeah like there aren't already enough classes in raids that need windfury... Feral druids go with the hunters.</div></div><hr />

What he meant is the extra damage would be very lame and barely do anything. <br />
<br />
<br />
And why WF with feral druid even came out?! This so has nothing to do with the topic.</div></div><hr />
