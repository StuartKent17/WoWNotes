Patch 4.0.6 changed how latency is displayed to the client, we now have a &quot;Home&quot; latency and a &quot;World&quot; latency, BrianI on the Tech Support forums posted a long explanation of what it means exactly and how latency works in WoW. <br />
<br />

<br />
We have been seeing a lot of confusion regarding some of our recent changes to the User Interface, specifically in regard to the new in-game latency meters. With 4.0.6, we have split the two separate connections the client forms to our game servers into two different ratings, labeled 'Home' and 'World'.<br />
<br />
The speculation regarding what these ratings mean has been very interesting and some of the guesses as to what the numbers actually refer to have been pretty imaginative. Some have speculated that 'Home' referred to your personal latency and 'World' was Blizzard's latency. This is incorrect.<br />
<br />
In essence, 'Home' refers to your connection to your realm server. This connection sends chat data, auction house stuff, guild chat and info, some addon data, and various other data. It is a pretty slim connection in terms of bandwidth requirements.<br />
<br />
'World' is a reference to the connection to our servers that transmits all the other data... combat, data from the people around you (specs, gear, enchants, etc.), NPCs, mobs, casting, professions, etc. Going into a highly populated zone (like a capital city) will drastically increase the amount of data being sent over this connection and will raise the reported latency.<br />
<br />
Prior to 4.0.6, the in-game latency monitor only showed 'World' latency, which caused a lot of confusion for people who had no lag while chatting, but couldn't cast or interact with NPCs and ended up getting kicked offline. We hoped that including the latency meters for both connections would assist in clarifying this for everyone.<br />
<br />
As is probably obvious based upon this information, the two connections are not used equally. There is a much larger amount of data being sent over the World connection, which is a good reason you may see disparities between the two times. If there is a large chunk of data 'queued' up on the server and waiting to be sent to your client, that 'ping' to the server is going to have to wait its turn in line, and the actual number returned will be much higher than the 'Home' connection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, great,&quot; you may say, &quot;but what does that mean to me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not much, maybe, but I wanted to focus on how local (or network) factors can (and will!) affect these numbers.<br />
<br />
Here are the most common causes of high pings/latency (on both Home and World):<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Wireless<br />
2) Packet loss<br />
3) Almost-but-not-quite-broadband*<br />
4) Addons (yes, those wonderful UI modifications)<br />
5) Firewalls (some firewalls do interesting things to latency... try playing without it to see if it helps!)<br />
5) Mis-configured or defective home routers (please temporarily bypass before anything else)<br />
6) Quality of Service and Traffic Management Systems performing packet queuing of some sort.<br />
7) Net link saturation (not necessarily your ISP, but somewhere between you and Blizzard)<br />
<br />
<br />
*As of July 2010, the 'official' definition of Broadband Internet (per the FCC) is '4Mbps downstream and 1Mbps upstream'. Anything lower than this is not 'officially' broadband.<br />
<br />
Lowering video settings (especially view distance) has the added benefit of lowering the amount of data your connection is asked to convey, as well, so even that can be a valid troubleshooting step.<br />
<br />
If your 'Home' connection latency is low and your 'World' connection latency is high, that frequently indicates that there is some sort of QoS congestion controls being applied to your internet connection, at either the micro (LAN) or macro (WAN) level. A common symptom would be that you would be able to chat, but not to cast.<br />
<br />
If both connections report high latency, that means your connection to our servers, in general, is almost completely saturated, or 'overflowing'. Without making any claims where that saturation lies, that seems to have been the most common case to date.<br />
<br />
Please refer to our support pages (such as http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=21018&amp;parentCategoryId&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;categoryId=2329) or contact a technical support representative directly for further information and troubleshooting. <br />

Patch 4.0.6 Latency Changes<br />
BrianI also explained why some people saw their latency improve dramatically in 4.0.6, and how they had to revert the changes for the moment to keep everyone happy. The good news is: tons of improvements are coming!<br />
With 4.0.6 we made a couple changes to our instance servers in an attempt to lower latency. Unfortunately, with those changes came increased bandwidth requirements. Due to the nature of the feedback we received, we have temporarily reverted those changes, as of around ~6pm PST last night. Are you still experiencing issues?<br />
<br />
Could you go into a little more detail on this? You said the change done with 4.0.6 caused a bandwidth problem but was said problem on my end, your end, or somewhere in between? If this change did cause a problem on my end how can I prepare for when it has been reimplemented?<br />
<br />
In a nutshell? That's a bit hard to explain clearly, but I'll try. Some people have an ISP whose peering link to their tier 1 backbone provider is oversaturated. Some people have ISPs that are throttling their connection in some way. Some people are on wireless connections, or are using old routers that are causing issues. Some people simply have a misconfigured or malfunctioning LAN device. Some people just have lower bandwidth connections. I’ll explain further below.<br />
<br />
Unequivocally, the bandwidth problems were not internal to our network. We never came close to capacity. The actual total peak transfer data rate was around 1/5th of our maximum capacity.<br />
<br />
When we performed maintenance the day we released 4.0.6 we made a couple modifications to our instance (BG/arena/dungeon/raid) servers. One of these changes had the effect of lowering latency for a very high percentage of our users... around 99% or so. The numbers were pretty staggering, to be honest. My personal ‘instance server’ experience was a drop from 120-150ms average ping down to 12ms. No, really, 12 ms. From my home residential connection. It was amazing. Raiding was glorious. The vast majority of our users saw similar improvements.<br />
<br />
Then again, I have a very stable high bandwidth cable connection with a well designed internal LAN, and I had no problems handling the requisite increases in bandwidth. You see, part of that reason the latency went down is that a lot more packets were being sent. In some cases, the bandwidth almost tripled. For those who don't (or can't) meet all of our minimum system requirements (e.g. broadband internet*) or who are having issues with their connection or are on a flaky wireless connection... things weren't so pretty. We ended up rolling back that change until a later date when we will be able to selectively turn on that performance enhancement on a ‘per client’ basis. Unfortunately, that will require another patch, so we’ll just have to wait a bit.<br />
<br />
Yes, we really did roll back that change for something that negatively affected less than 1% of total users. We really do care about providing the best environment we can. We do things like this frequently.<br />
<br />
We do understand that some people do not have the options available to them that others do. We know that people are playing on 6 to 8 year old computers (in some cases, even older) with a flaky 3G or satellite connection, even though this does not meet our minimum system requirements. Not everyone can afford newer or better and not all areas have a faster connection available, currently. We do see people connecting from all over the world from backbones that are throttling their connections due to the cost of transmitting data over transoceanic cables. We see all these things… and we feel some of the same frustrations these people do when trying to have a smooth gaming experience. It is actually difficult to be unable to help someone due to situations outside your control.<br />
<br />
To be honest, World of Warcraft was not designed for these types of setups. That is why we are very clear with our ‘minimum system requirements’ and what, exactly, is supported. Will we still try to help you connect and do our best to help you out, anyway? Absolutely. We just can’t make any promises or guarantees, as much as we would like to. The actual bandwidth requirements are not that high. In ordinary play, WoW shouldn’t end up taking more than a few hundred megabytes a month. What is important, however, is the stability of the connection and width of the ‘pipe’, due to the bursts of data that need to be transmitted at times. While total bandwidth may not be high, there will be short periods where a ton of data is being sent simultaneously (like, you know, raid boss fights or even when first logging on to a server when your toon is in a capital city).<br />
<br />
We may wish it were otherwise, but if we tried to send and receive less data we wouldn’t be able to provide the immersive, complex, top-notch gaming experience (most people) have come to know, love, and expect from Blizzard Entertainment. I wish there were some way to do both, but there really isn’t, at least with today’s technologies. Either we can provide an intense environment that over 98% of people who play WoW have no problems with, or we can lower our standards to unacceptable levels and try to get that extra ~2% in, as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I apologize for the lengthy post, and I’m sure this will be lost in the thread, but I’ve been meaning to post some thoughts on this for awhile. I hope you’ve enjoyed the read… it was fun to type, at least. :)<br />

Getting a GM Survey without a ticket response<br />
This is a known issue and from what I understand, has to do with the limitations of the in-game mail system. We are, of course, working with our developers to find a solution. &gt;^.^&lt;<br />
<br />
In the mean time, I do apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this may cause. We are definitely aware of the frustration an individual might feel if they see their petition disappear and receive a survey with seemingly no response. Remember that Game Masters will respond to each and every petition submitted, and be sure to always check your in-game mail before filling out a survey.

You may want to look into Pingbetter.com its free(currently in beta) and if you sign up you get it for a free year. I've personally tried a lot of ping lowering programs being on the east coast playing on a west coast server and it's been the best/easiest to use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The guy does way too much IMHO. At one point he was taking care of 6 very long stick threads related to Disconnections and Latency. He used to attempt to answer every post or failing that answer every post that was either glaring off topic or a different issue altogether. He's backed off on that now as he does get a bit busy - I know from a few blues I've spoken to that he's pretty much busy all day , on the phone with ISP techs as well as multiple online methods of communication (IRC , email , IM's etc etc) all day.<br />
<br />
I would really hate to see the guy burn himself out - he needs to delegate some of his work to some other people IMHO.<br />
<br />
That's not the only thing he's done. Boub if you're reading this you need to add this in too :<br />
<br />
http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1965992365?page=16#301<br />
<br />
He's reversed the 3.3.5 &quot;pick a random port from a pool&quot; connection issue.<br />
<br />
Previous to 3.3.5 when you logged on your realm server it would open up a connection to that realm servers IP address only on port 3724. For some unknown reason with (AFAIK) 3.3.5 they changed it so it would randomly pick a port chosen from the following ports : 1119,3724,4000,6112-6119 . I have verified this over the months since 3.3.5 with netstat - one server would connect on 3724 , another server would pick 1119, another would pick 4000. Even if you connected to say an instance or battleground or continent specific server it would do this and not always to the same port it connected to your realm server on.<br />
<br />
This caused a few issues with some people to point where there would be exceptionally long threads about it in the old forums - when they connected to their realm on port 3724 no bad latency , any other ports caused bad latency. Don't ask me why as I don't know why that was so.<br />
<br />
Brian L's gotten this reversed - world of warcraft will now connect solely on port 3724 to any realm server.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for that. I find it hard to believe its completely free for the full year considering its beta and they might just attach free access for all right now.

I'm glad they reverted the changes, not sure if my connection could handle it. I wish what their FCC labelled as broadband was the definition of broadband in New Zealand because whilst some people get above 4Mbps speeds, I am certainly not one of them (don't even know why, to be honest).<br />
<br />
I'm not into trusting the latency monitor in-game, however. I feel it's incredibly inaccurate, the reason is why is that I'm actually on a bank alt in the middle of Stormwind City's Auction House (Trade District one, not the Dwarven District one) and am getting a &quot;Home&quot; ping of ~1200-1400ms and a &quot;World&quot; ping of ~4000-6000 ms.

Why?<br />
Turning off the firewall while playing will don't make any difference protection-wise.<br />

<br />
Firewalls, particularly software firewalls, can and often will &quot;batch up&quot; the traffic going either way, and then check a number of packets all together. While this may mean that the firewall itself will use less CPU/be more efficient, it can cause a sometimes massive increase in latency due to this batching operation. This is because the packets that are sent/received are not sent on instantly, and may instead be checked as a big batch, say, every quarter of a second, for instance. Taking that example, and allowing for 50ms to process all of the packets gives an instant increase of 300ms to your latency before anything has even left your computer. Not to mention you may get the same delay on the way back in.<br />
<br />
While ok for non-time sensitive applications like web/media streaming (with appropriate buffering), for games, where sometimes a few milliseconds can be all the difference, this is a very bad thing.<br />
<br />
While it is not appropriate in all situations, playing without a firewall as a test can be a useful indicator of whether or not your own firewall is actually causing such a problem.</div></div><hr />

The most interesting part is that it does not affect all servers in a battle group. In two runs we had one or two people totally unaffected - however in both cases neither was the tank and they reported near instant aggro when other people reported being stuck. It was like those affected didn't matter anymore.<br />

We may wish it were otherwise, but if we tried to send and receive less data we wouldn’t be able to provide the immersive, complex, top-notch gaming experience (most people) have come to know, love, and expect from Blizzard Entertainment. I wish there were some way to do both, but there really isn’t, at least with today’s technologies. Either we can provide an intense environment that over 98% of people who play WoW have no problems with, or we can lower our standards to unacceptable levels and try to get that extra ~2% in, as well.<br />

<br />
They changed the way the client and servers handled packages, sending them more often in smaller packages.<br />
This in turn can &quot;clutter up the package queue&quot;. In other words, too many packages are sent, &quot;smart&quot; firewalls/routers/W.E. cluster up those packages and send them as a larger package instead of many small ones - at a slower interval than the game itself sends them. This will cause lag and in some cases disconnects due to loss of too many packages.<br />
<br />
The change they applied will show you if you have set up your connection well. If it doesn't work, either your LAN or your ISP is not set up correctly. Granted, you can't do much about your ISPs set up other than bitch and whine at them, but if enough people do it they will bend over for the masses.<br />
Your own LAN on the other hand is each persons own responsibility to set up and maintain.<br />
<br />
However, if everything is set up correctly, you will notice better ping times(latency) than you had before the patch.<br />
<br />
I advise checking the entire thread. It has quite a lot of insight on how to approach the changes that are coming.</div></div><hr />

I don't see a contradiction. I assume you are talking about how they are not providing the best environment they can for 99% of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
However, they only recently tweaked their bandwidth/latency stuff. It is not as if they took something away from the 99% that the 99% have been using for months or even years.<br />
<br />
That 99% of the playerbase has been doing just fine for over 6 years. I think we can wait a little bit longer for Blizzard to figure out what went wrong and try to improve the experience.<br />
<br />
My point is that the playerbase didn't lose anything, we just haven't gained anything yet.</div></div><hr />

So you, personally, in all the world, have 5000 Latency and you somehow think this is Blizzard's issue to fix?

<br />
The sooner those &quot;per client&quot; tweaks can be patched in, the better.<br />
<br />
Yes they really reverted a change that shaved a 100 or 200ms of latency off people who already had a really good connection to prevent it from seriously impacting 1% of the population whose connections went to complete shit. That's good business and fair to customers. It's a shame, and I hope they can fix it so I can get those 100ms shaved off again, but I don't want to sacrifice someone else's ability to play at all so I can have an almost unnoticeablely better connection.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't get this. They changed the requirements of the bandwidth in an attempt to improve on latency, which actually caused folks to have increased latency. This Brian guy is suggesting that's because their systems/internet couldn't handle it.<br />
<br />
And that's exactly what happened. Networking is complicated, and as Brian points out his explanation is necessarily complicated as well. The change they made reduced latency at the expense of burst high bandwidth requirements. Much like we talk about damage being &quot;spikey&quot; in game, this caused the bandwidth requirements to become &quot;spikey&quot;. That's harder on connections, just like &quot;spikey&quot; damage is harder on healers. Misconfigurations or supersaturation anywhere up or down your Internet stream can cause the &quot;spikes&quot; to get backed up. The problem could be anywhere from your ISP's backbone connection all the way down to your computer or router. The fact that you have a pretty good connection most of the time doesn't leave out the possibility that somewhere in either your setup or your ISP's setup something may not be dealing with spikes well.</div></div><hr />

2. None of the Naggle, Ack crap matters if you code your game to use UDP. Why would anyone code a game in TCP. By the time TCP works out some lost packet guarenteed delivery algorithms that point in time of the game is long gone and the packet is now meaningless.<br />

Because blizz didn't release fix. Great!<br />
In reality my guess would be that it fixes 10% or less connection, 80% stays same 10% got really fked up, that's REAL reason why they stopped it and are waiting for per client setting.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that sounds more like the truth of the matter to me, but then I have a hard time believing that I was one of the 1%.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I'm glad they FINALLY at least admitted that the problems were caused by changes they made. Doh!</div></div><hr />

Tried to turn off V-sync? like in... its capping @ your refresh rate of 60 hz?<br />
<br />

Stop what ? Making sense ?<br />

You really should try understanding how a firewall software works first before even saying a word in that thread. A firewall MAY queue up packets on your computer in order to analyze them, hence causing lag. Simple as this. If you're not able to understand this simple fact, there's no hope for you.</div></div><hr />

Most sane people lock their fps at 60 since the human eye can not perceive frame refreshes higher than that. Given that, most modern good sound cards can get 100-200 fps on WoW, which is a very old game by now. So this guy simple has the frame rate unlocked. No biggie. Its kinda like GS i guess.</div></div><hr />

This is not true, ask anyone who has a system that can do 60, 100, 200 fps. you CAN tell the difference. why and how you can tell the difference can be found here<br />

Of course the &quot;minimum FPS&quot; increases the faster the movements on the screen are, but WoW is not as much about rapid movements as a shooter game, thus requiring a lower value. 60 is a good one for WoW.</div></div><hr />
