Patch 6.0.2 Class Balance<br />
Hunters, we're not ignoring you, or satisfied with the current situation. New data helps us find the issue. We just need to work through the discrepancies, and find out what is disguising the issue on our side. Maybe we assume this is obvious, but it'll help to hear: The goal is equality. We'll continue working toward that goal. Obviously, we are not there yet. Nor do we expect to get there at 90 (but will get closer). We *do* expect to get there at 100.<br />
<br />
I hope you do the same for all classes.<br />
We are. Hunters are just at the top of our list right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blasted Lands Quest Rewards<br />
If you were eager to do the Blasted Lands event quests, you may have completed them before rewards were hotfixed in. The quests are now correctly rewarding item level 520 trinkets. If you actually need the trinket and did the quest early on, you may have to wait for a fix:<br />

<br />
I don't have a specific update, but the potential resolution will be one available to all those affected and not something that we'd &quot;fix&quot; on an individual level.<br />
<br />
Developmental implementation can take a little time though so it will likely be a few days before they can create, test and implement their resolution. I'll provide any updates I am able to pass along. <br />

<br />
<br />
Group Finder<br />
Several players have expressed concerns (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14882078357?page=1) about the new Group Finder, such as the 25 visible groups cap and timers on different things. <br />
When we design our default UI elements we follow some core design philosophies to ensure we have a consistent, approachable, unobtrusive, and easy-to-use interface. And, also like most default UI elements, the Premade Groups tool is fully moddable. We'd fully expect that, much like unit frames, raid frames, etc., that those who are looking for different layouts and additional functionality will turn to creating and using addons. Which is of course largely the point and focus of addon support--allowing people to gain additional customization and functionality beyond what the default UI might offer. Quite a few players prefer that additional functionality and customization, and that's awesome, that's what makes addons great. But it is early still, the patch hasn't been out long, and mods tend to spring from a personal or collective desire for specific functionality or customization. Maybe you can help inspire an addon author?<br />
<br />
That said, we're still definitely looking for feedback on what changes or features people want to see made to the default UI in future updates, and any constructive feedback on layout improvements or changes are more than welcome. In this case the UI and Macro forum (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1011693/) is probably the best place to help consolidate feedback.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.0.2 Stat Squish and Leveling Concerns<br />
We have a hotfix in testing that will adjust creature scaling to better account for the stat squish.<br />
<br />
To elaborate a bit, this isn't just about the stat squish. That was actually a relatively straightforward process numerically. But we made three separate changes that all affected the pacing and danger level of legacy content throughout the game:<br />
<br />
The &quot;stat squish&quot; wherein items from level 60 through Mists of Pandaria dungeon gear were changed to use a linear instead of an exponential scale. Doubling player health, enabling us to remove resilience from PvP and also make damage and healing less &quot;spiky&quot; in general. Removing base points from spells to allow for better scaling and tuning across classes - previously a Frostbolt might have done X damage plus Y% of your spell power; now, in 6.0.2, it just does Z% of your spell power.<br />
<br />
Any tuning issues that are being seen, particularly in level-up content (especially dungeons), aren't a result of the squish alone but rather the combination of all three changes. We've been following data and feedback closely, and are testing internally the change that Lore mentioned, which should hopefully be deployed within a day or so (it will require server restarts). In the meantime, if there are particular creature abilities that you encounter that seem disproportionately deadly, it's quite helpful to keep pointing those out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Damage in PvP<br />
We've just applied a hotfix that will reduce pvp damage by 25%. Once the expansion launches, it will be reverted, but it should make skirmishes a bit more palatable in the meantime. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344859-we-have-to-deal-with-this-for-a-month/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14882118410?page=4#67))<br />
<br />
Battleground Queues<br />
Correct, we'll unfortunately need to restart realms in order for the fix to apply. Restarts are scheduled for early tomorrow morning in the North American region. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344592-battlegrounds-are-not-working/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14883048356?page=20#389))<br />
<br />
Mythic/Warforged Items Downgrading to Normal<br />
Don't have any information to share at this time but letting you know that we're currently investigating the issue. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344817-mythic-warforged-item-becomes-normal-version/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14880818443?page=1#9))<br />
<br />
Blasted Lands Rewards Availability Duration<br />
Yep, the Iron Starlette pet and Iron Vanguard title are only available until Warlords launches on November 13th. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344793-iron-starlette-question/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14882118463?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
Loot Based Lockouts<br />
The loot-based lockouts should be in place on Normal or Heroic for Siege of Orgrimmar, and should work a lot like Flex partial clears did in 5.4: based on the leader's lockout, with bosses despawned from the start until reaching the first one the leader hasn't killed (so, e.g. if a leader has done Immerseus and Norushen but somehow was not saved to Protectors, their instance would begin with Immerseus dead, but Protectors and Norushen still alive).<br />
<br />
More or less, you should be able to pick up where you left off in Normal or Heroic, and if you enter a different instance where a boss you've already killed still lives, you can help out but you won't get loot.<br />
<br />
From the above, it sounds like there may be some bugs here. It's a complex system, and a big part of why we converted Siege of Orgrimmar to use the new system in 6.0 was to make entirely certain that we work out any glitches before Draenor raids commence. We'll look into it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344607-60-raid-lockout-question-starting-boss/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14728143554?page=1#9))<br />
<br />
Level 90 Boost Experience<br />
Sorry about any confusion! When Warlords of Draenor releases boosted characters will have their abilities introduced a few at a time as they quest through the intro Draenor experience. Until then we've made the new Iron Tide invasion event an accelerated version of the same process. If you're on a boosted character you'll want to begin the Blasted Lands questline that pops up when you first log in, and your abilities will unlock as you go.<br />
<br />
We recently updated the patch notes with that information.<br />
<br />
Boosted Characters<br />
<br />
Newly Boosted Characters now start on the front lines in the Blasted Lands, doing whatever they can to stop the Iron Horde pouring out of The Dark Portal and start with a basic set of spells and abilities for their class. Characters unlock the rest of their spells and abilities by advancing through the Iron Horde Incursion world event in the Blasted Lands. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344568-level-90-character-boost-ripoff/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14882288239?page=1#10))<br />

General statement: we do not have any plans for any more toybox changes until we see how things shake out over the next few months. Anything with a player or NPC interaction, teleport, movement buff, or a quest item was intentionally not included. It is one thing for a character to have earned those items at the intended level, but giving them to every character may not be appropriate.

Only cooldowns greater than 3 minutes reset at the end of raid encounter attempts, so that isn't a bug. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/519507441789452288))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
can you confirm, in WoD RBGS award same amount of Conquest as arena rating?<br />
In Warlords, your cap is based on your highest rating, whether it's arenas or RBGs. RBGs do provide an extra chance at gear tough. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/519293009926819840))<br />
<br />
can real id friends group queue for Ashran?<br />
yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/519687174338265089))<br />
<br />
oh, huh? So on busy servers we can expect queue times? I expect similar but opposite servers like KT and MG to merge?<br />
the focus is having both sides full, not making sure both sides have equal queue times. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/519687699880366082))<br />
<br />
You mentioned in an interview Mythic gear will get reduced ilvl in PvP Combat. Waht ilvl will it be? What about Legendary effects?<br />
690 and PvE set bonuses don't work (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/519870383546052608))<br />
<br />
Quick Q: is Ashran going work like TB/WG in that only ~equal amounts of players from each faction can be in it? #WoW<br />
No. Ashran queuing is basically a bouncer. We let everyone in until we're at capacity for the server. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/520048487665106945))<br />
<br />
with Ashran servers being grouped for faction balance, are they still being matched within CRZ groups, or was that idea discarded?<br />
We'll try to match them up in the same data centers as much as possible. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/520062661229162497))<br />

Lore<br />
...deal with that through Thrall, but now HE'S fucking back, yet we're losing Khadgar, and I assume the Kirin Tor again<br />
How are you losing him? He's more active than he's ever been in WoW. Everyone benefits from his presence. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519508479870898177))<br />
<br />
did the FOTR only react? did King Arthur? villains create drama, but they don't have to be everything.<br />
Gandalf is reacting to Sauron. You know this because there's a lot of time for the details to unfold. Not a luxury games have. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519523517985865728))<br />
We want to put up a big enemy and give you reasons to fight them, we make you want to go on the adventure and take them down. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519523744708960256))<br />
Villains aren't &quot;everything&quot; but you need a strong, clear conflict for players to resolve. Otherwise it's not compelling. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519523924980158465))<br />
<br />
Tradition is no excuse. Break tradition, create heroes that are proactive - reactive heroes seem less intelligent.<br />
What would a &quot;proactive&quot; hero do? What conflict would they solve? Who created the conflict? Genuinely curious. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519507475519643649))<br />
proactive heroes strike first against, even seek out, evil and injustice. Batman chillin until signaled vs. out patrolling Gotham<br />
We do that all the time in quests. It's also pretty much the definition of a raid. We do it constantly. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519513411290292225))<br />
I get what you're saying; it's in the details. Evil is out there and we're going to go stop it. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519513204628533248))<br />
At a high level, he's still reacting to crime. Someone is still creating conflict which he has to resolve. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519512909764767744))<br />
As a player I feel proactive constantly. In the past the majority of faction heroes felt static/reactive unlike in the RTS games.<br />
That is fair, but you were also playing as those characters on their journeys. You had enough time with Arthas to care. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519529653258551296))<br />
<br />
also, Garrosh's goals have been the Horde's goals for half the lifetime of this game...<br />
Horde is divided, even players are split between Garrosh's goals of conquest and Thrall's goals of peace. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519557609364267009))<br />
<br />
When's next time you see Alliance as having a &quot;bad guy&quot;? All Alliance &quot;buy guys&quot; have been &quot;corrupted&quot; somehow (Illidan, Arthas)<br />
That's a good question. We don't have any in the works right now, but I think we're overdue for an Alliance villain. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519562175019376640))<br />
<br />
Horde have explicit goals and the story serves those goals. can you honestly say the alliance does also beyond &quot;hold the line&quot;?<br />
What do you perceive to be the Horde's explicit goals? I think you're falsely bundling all Horde up with Garrosh. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519551014441975809))<br />
to blur the line between them. Not that it's fair just understandable how it can happen.<br />
Yeah, conquest is an easy goal to push. What kind of large-scale goal could Alliance undertake? Perhaps reclamation. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519577934667849728))<br />
Or maybe they're simply the first to discover and begin attacking a new threat. Definitely opportunities. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519578043975618562))<br />
<br />
Khadgar has always been my favorite character, however now you've turned him into a traitor to the Alliance. Are you proud?<br />
How is he a traitor? Because he doesn't kill Horde on sight? By that logic, all faction leaders are &quot;traitors.&quot; Disagree. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519506785590181889))<br />
… Please answer me, why this difference between Khadgar and Thrall? Any difference besides they belong to different factions?<br />
Thrall isn't truly neutral, either. He's Horde, but he can set differences aside to work with Ally when needed. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519578198061744128))<br />
Jaina behaved similarly before her city was nuked. Anduin and Varian can do it as well. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519578279297024000))<br />
<br />
The story makes it seem like the Alliance only raids Orgrimmar BECAUSE of the Rebellion. Otherwise no. They've always been concerned with other things. It beggars belief, sometimes.<br />
Thing is, Horde story is largely concerned with bigger things, too/ There's always a bigger threat than each other. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519669594357657601))<br />
Or like Ashenvale: the Alliance was off fighting Old Gods and only taking minimal action against the Horde until the end.<br />
Alliance move into the Barrens and torch Camp Taurajo, one of my favorite old quest hubs. We can go back and forth all day. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519671021377306625))<br />
For what it's worth, I recall being f'ing terrified of night elves in Ashenvale. Really felt like enemy territory. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519675090024140802))<br />
But, I mean, is this valuable feedback? How can we make our concerns better known or clearer?<br />
It's all valuable. Specific examples and concerns help a lot more than broad assertions like &quot;never&quot; and &quot;always.&quot; (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519672078908137473))<br />
I think we've drifted too far into stereotypes of &quot;grr aggressive bloodthirsty orc&quot; vs. &quot;ye olde stoic knight defender.&quot; (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519672398748987393))<br />
I understand the overall desire is to show more proactive heroism from the Alliance. Give them some teeth. I agree. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519672231870201856))<br />
For what it's worth, those themes work well on a broad scale. They are a good backdrop. We aim for variety in the details. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519672647169232896))<br />
<br />
Is there any chance you guys might change Garrosh's fate? He's become a fairly interesting character, lots of room for growth<br />
Pretty unlikely. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519899440337805313))<br />
<br />
where are they in the game? Lorewise there may be a lot of casualties but we dont see them in game<br />
Probably didn't stand out to Alliance players, but as Horde it was really grim. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/520242037161861121))<br />
Also a lot of the trash in SoO are literally Orgrimmar NPCs. The corpses strung about are old trainers, vendors, etc. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/520241968874393600))<br />
<br />
True. Does this mean that the Horde are villains? That's a problem. Too many mixed messages.<br />
No, but Garrosh certainly became one. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/520241437514801152))<br />
so if the Alliance are heroes, and heroes react, what does that make the Horde?<br />
Does that make the Alliance villains? No, it's a conflict the player characters would likely want to solve. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/520242724440522752))<br />
Imagine Varian suddenly decides humans are the supreme race, drums up an army, and begins executing dwarves and gnomes. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/520242575127494656))<br />
Horde are heroes as well. You're lumping all of the Horde in with Garrosh, who raised an evil regime from within the Horde. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/520242263696232448))<br />
You said the Ally, as heroes, generally react. Not saying Horde are villains, but it seems devs think they're more interesting.<br />
I mean all heroes, in general, react to some conflict or situation. Horde players, too. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/520243871851102210))<br />

what is the plan for lvl 100 content. Lvl 100 seems rather barren barring the daily, ashran, and the gear up.<br />
Quest-wise, we have new quest lines coming out of the garrison every week at max level, as well as a legendary quest. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519511528920203264))<br />
Beyond that, you have just as much or more as any other expac: dungeon, raid, outdoor max-level areas, world bosses, etc. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/519511704875442176))<br />

Do ya think garrison mine &amp; garden for all make prof mats quite unbalanced against leather? Wtb slot-free skin hut <br />

<br />
It's not that hunters are just low. It's that they're much lower than expected. As in lower than Blizzard expected. So there's a bug somewhere for them to find and fix, even if instead of a code error it's an unforeseen interaction or something like that.</div></div><hr />

You did old content with a buff that allows you to mow the place down. (I mean, I was clearing the same stuff very quickly with my ilvl 518 fury warrior and ilvl 513 mage). Blasted Lands content is optimized for boosted characters. Try some current dungeon/raid content and then tell us how powerful it feels.<br />
<br />
Not trying to be mean, but when the hunters are barely ahead of the tanks in Mythic SoO (after a patch where most tank damage has been negated), then there's probably a problem with the class.</div></div><hr />

Hunters which used to destroy everyone on Thok the Bloodthirsty on Heroic before the patch are being dwarfed by other classes on Mythic post-patch. That was definitely a red flag.</div></div><hr />

Think it's because it's 3 specs vs 1 spec, so increasing shadow dps is much lower on the list of things to do &gt;.&lt; I agree it's very silly that they seem to be happy that certain specs are op/ underpowered for entire expansions :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, and I just can't understand why Blizz is not getting the fundamental flaw that shadow has since BC. It does not work to have a class that has no initial burst, has low armor(and nothing that tanks for him) and can not run faster than enemies(first we flat out had not the ability. Now we face numerous snares and can't cast anything serious while running...and in pvp the other classes are not exactly slower overall). Those three things are rock, scissor, paper in PvE AND PvP. You got to be exceptional good at one of them if you are not good at the 2 others or you have no chance. Not being able to move while having to take massive damage and not being able to burst the enemy to prevent such damage is a combination that CAN NOT and DOES NOT work. Patch after patch after patch the same mistake.<br />
<br />
And Blizz does it again this patch. This patch feels like a 30% nerf for shadow in solo/small group content(and that is about 90% of the playtime). I run around with ilvl577 and it feels like 550. And as if that would not be bad enough...no...we effectively can't heal ourselves anymore and we lost even more armor. On top of that we had very few spells we could cast while running(EVERYONE knew that shadow is dead while running)...so we could throw in a heal here or there to at least do SOMETHING, but ALL of them are gone now(renew gone, prayer of healing has a casttime now, halo etc. lost their healing ability)...and the icing to the cake is that devouring plague can often not be casted while running cause you NEED 3 orbs now to use it(and those orbs you only generate while standing or having procc-luck that isn't reliable at all.) and that our mind sear AoE is that weak that you are better off multidotting SW:P no matter how many targets are there.<br />
<br />
I think it says a lot if Blizz has to hotfix the shadow and give him 10%+ damage on many important abilites just a day before the patch(that they have had on beta for like half a year) and it STILL is weak. As someone who had the luck to have chosen witchdoctor at release of Diablo III(those that have been there know what I mean), it really makes me wonder who is doing the balancing there.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a different topic: I think the alliance would not be happy if Jaina did turn into a genocidal maniac(she is on the track there with Dalaran) and become the main villian and the Undead squashing Stormwind. The whole issue sounds to me like the alliance players will only be satisfied when they have an expansion where they can be the heroes that defeat the Horde as a whole...and that just isn't going to happen cause Blizz can't portray the Horde much weaker than they already did this expansion without of really pissing off horde players(after all horde players don't want to be shown as weak either). Last but not least we have played a lot of stories involving the alliance already(be it the whole story around Varian and his son, the Arthas storyline or the feud of the dwarves)...while up to Cata/MoP there was pretty much nothing that did shape the horde at all. Maybe it was time to give them some serious characters before turning back to alliance again(and seriously, we already have little prince as the next superhero in the making there)...<br />

From what I understood in the hunter threads was that in WoD Blizz wanted the dedicated DPS classes to out shine the hybrid classes (as they should). When it was applied, all the other DPS classes were doing respectable damage while after hunters were tweeked *cough* taking away our 30% damage buff aspect of the hawk*cough* we were barely doing more damage than tanks. Hence the QQing.<br />
<br />
Nope. As far as I read it they finally did NOT want to make them outshine the hybrids anymore cause they essentailly took hybrids their minor advantages(shadows can't heal anything anymore...their selfheal ain't much better than that of dedicated dds by now) that they used as cheap excuse to buff other dds dps by like 20% above that of hybrids(which resulted in hybrids not being taken to CMs etc.. Looks like being able to heal a bit is not exactly compareable to 20% more damage, who would have guessed????).</div></div><hr />

Funny you should say that, because if all hunters were quiet Blizzard wouldn't make us a top priority and we would be broken on release. The interesting part is that they can no longer just buff aspect of the hawk and call it a fix, so what are they going to do within a month that they couldn't do within the beta period.<br />
<br />
Pure dps class performing so poorly is a concern, because there is nothing else hunters can do but dps. On top of it, now is the time guilds are looking to create rosters for the mythic progression and hunters will get to enjoy their class mount once again http://abload.de/img/thebenchg6ugc.jpg</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, Hunters are broken because we're in a month where all classes are in an awkward state due to balance no longer being handled for level 90. Granted, Hunters with the exception of MM are simming to be pretty bad at 100 too but it's anyone's guess as to how accurate or inaccurate those reports are especially when you factor in all the encounters which are nearly the opposite of their Patchwerk-like testing structure.<br />
<br />
I don't think Blizzard can over-buff at 90 without affecting level 100 so they'll likely try to find a compromise to at least make Hunters somewhat competitive at 90 than being blown out of the water by much lower item level characters who didn't get hit so hard with nerfs or changes.<br />
<br />
People who quit their class within this period of time we're never fully invested in it to begin with. Playing other classes in the mean time, sure, but outright quitting? Nah. Forest beyond the trees and all that stuff.</div></div><hr />

The simulations are the best part, because like hunters sims were low, and Bliz is all like &quot;those sims are inaccurate&quot; and lo and behold they are scrambling to figure out a way to buff them now. Maybe those sims aren't all that inaccurate.<br />
<br />
Overall 6.02 is pretty amateur. There are some rather glaring issues that should have been caught in QC/testing. Being an IT professional myself, I understand the complexities involved in rolling out software updates, and there are nearly always &quot;gotchas&quot;. But let's face it, this is sort of a train wreck. Quest items, leveling, mob tuning, class scaling ... just about every facet of the game is broken in some way. <br />
<br />
It is obvious that they did no internal raid testing of either the current or old content. That is dropping the ball.</div></div><hr />

I attempted ToT lfr and had the same problem (only defeated the 2nd boss, no loot). my warlock (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/echo-isles/Drakkal/simple). I think I played a total of 7 months this entire expansion. 700 charms didn't go very far when upgrading gear, and even then, I still can't seem to get that 1 last point.

I knew there was problems when my 525 ilvl warrior was doing only a few k less dps than my 579 hunter on the beta.

What on earth are they thinking releasing such a crap of a pre-patch with so many huge issues that look to be hurting the game all next expansion? Cause everyone knows many of these issues regarding class and spec balance will be hard to fix and will need much more time than 2-3 months to get right. <br />

That's not what I'm saying... Yes I've yet to see what happens in SoO (tonight, I will).<br />
<br />
But I'm saying that, last week, I was wiping on the first boss of Throne of the 4 winds, because too much damage taken, and too few damage dealt.<br />
In a week, i didn't change anything on my stuff, except re-optimizing it when the patch went live. I go to throne of the 4 winds. I mowed the place down with only my Arcane Shot, Didn't even loose any life....<br />
<br />
I heard that there was an &quot;invisible buff&quot;, Okay that's fine.<br />
But this buff is absent from Blasted Lands. Okay it's meant for boosted characters, but how do you explain that one gmage guildie with a better stuff than me, took 30 minutes to make the whole quest chain, when I took only 15 ? (and we both did the quest the same way, not reading everything, using flying mount, etc.)...<br />

because priest have more utility than hunters. heals/buffs/mp5 hunters give nothing other than aspect of the fox now. so if we dont have dps we have nothing. A shadowpriest can dps lower but bring alot more to a group with some ohshit moment saves</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is absolutely not the case in WoD. Shadow priests and every other hybrid for that matter no longer offer any additional utility than pures do. Every dps spec, as far as I know, has at most one utility button exclusive to the spec. For shadow priests, it's Vampiric Embrace. For mages, it's Amplify Magic. Hunters, Aspect of the Fox. I believe Ret Paladins don't even get one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aside from the fact that nobody knows how screwed that statistic is, I find it interesting that shadows(the ONLY damage spec of Priests, so you got no alternative there) are doing pretty well by your definition although the majority of other specs are doing better(up to 25% better). Seems like it is carved in your mind that the shadow is already fine when it is &quot;somewhere down there&quot; while you cry out loud if the hunter is &quot;down there too&quot;.<br />
<br />
Maybe cause it's always been like that? But that really ain't a good reason for ANY shadow out there since NO shadow has been invited by a group for it's &quot;utility&quot; in ages. People want dps from a dd...</div></div><hr />

My group DPS ranking is the same as before... The 2 hunters are first, we have a shaman on third, a rogue on 4th, a priest on 5th, the rest are tanks and heals (3 heals). And nothing changed at all except the lower numbers, but the overall power of the group is the same. (though the heroic version seemed very easy to me... We were able to do 7 boss in a row, facerolling, when we had just finished Thok when the patch went live.)<br />

<br />
Ok seeing your group comp I understand a bit more. Despite your shaman should be beating you still if their gear is comparable. You're top bc of your group comp. I spent the past year raiding with warrior, 2 hunters, warlock, monk, and spriest. Depending on fight monk and spriest switched roles but we generally solo tanked/2 healed most of the now mythic bosses. All but the spriest have been competing on dps the entire time. Generally I was first bc BM burst. But, we were all pretty on par. Even the spriest wasn't far below us. <br />
<br />
Now in 6.0, not only is the warrior doing double that of the hunters, but ppl playing warrior &amp; a few other classes who are 20-30 ilvls below us are annihilating us. I've played with this other hunter for over a year. We've been competing for top all year. Overnight we not only dropped to the bottom but we're barely doing half the dps of the top. That's unbalanced, and where the complaints are stemming from. <br />
<br />
Now for the priest comments. Our priest has gone disc as was the plan for 20 man all along bc he's always been backup heals anyway. But, considering priest is the only class with 2 heal specs which has 1 particular spell that's extremely easily abused right now, my sympathy there is somewhat lacking.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
Whether you like to heal or not is irrelevant. Priest always has the option to switch roles. Hunters do not, which is why us being at the bottom on all 3 specs is so unacceptable. Priest can switch roles whether they want to or not. Hunter has to switch toons. It benches the entire class. And I'm not referring to sims, I'm referring to logs, as MM may sim mid pack but logs of fights with actual mechanics requiring movement show the real picture here.</div></div><hr />

Priest always has the option to switch roles. Hunters do not, which is why us being at the bottom on all 3 specs is so unacceptable. Priest can switch roles whether they want to or not. Hunter has to switch toons. It benches the entire class. And I'm not referring to sims, I'm referring to logs, as MM may sim mid pack but logs of fights with actual mechanics requiring movement show the real picture here.<br />

What a crappy comment. Playing a dd and playing a healer is a totally different playstyle. Different dd-classes differ much less in their playstyle than spriest and disc/holy. If you say &quot;spriest not good? Then just play healer.&quot; then I say &quot;Hunter not good? Fine, level a different class, you got a free level 90 boost anyway.&quot;. Such a statement is ignorant, egoistic and stupid...sorry.</div></div><hr />

Less on ptr thanks to the broken character copy. They were ignored or right out dismissed for lack of &quot;data&quot;. It wasn't until logs got posted that the blue dragon finally admitted the issue that he had denied existed only days before. As a matter of fact, you can listen to them claiming the sims were wrong on the convert to raid podcast recorded Monday. The very next day logs get posting showing they were almost dead on and finally they acknowledge what had already been reported. Hence the ticked off attitude about it by many players. <br />
<br />
Every time I post feedback on an issue regardless of how minor it is, I get 10+ people making the comment that &quot;it's beta it'll change&quot;. Well no kidding! That's why I'm posting the feedback to tell them what I'm seeing! Classic example: trap launcher falls off when switching talents right now. Got berated by people as whining by stating the circumstance, what I was doing when it was happening, etc. yet low and behold watcherdev was unaware of this issue and asked us questions to help track it down. (That one still isn't fixed). But we got the same treatment from other players for reporting that AOC trinket was bugged for survival. But oh look they hotfixed it.<br />

You consider it egotistic for me to tell them to switch specs, I consider it egotistic to tell me to switch classes. It works both ways. They have a choice if the reroll. I don't. And for the record, I won't reroll. I've raided on a hunter for 8 years. If I can't raid on the hunter I'm more likely to unsub simply bc there's nothing for me to do in game at that point. Mind you I have full intentions to give them a chance to fix things. But as a mythic raider I'm useless at the moment. So if it stays that way in Highmaul I'm out of a job 2 weeks after launch. 5 mans and quests aren't the content I play. So I'll take a break till it's fixed if it comes to it simply to not waste money while I can't play.</div></div><hr />

I would like to remind some of you that we only just got this PRE-Patch a few days ago and we have another 3 weeks before the REAL Expac is released then we can level to 100 and really find out who why and what our chars are capable of.<br />
<br />
Have fun out there and look out behind you :p</div></div><hr />

My concern was at level 100. They're working on getting that closer though so my concerns are no longer what they were. I don't care if I'm at the top. What I did care about was the fact that I was suddenly doing half that of people 30 ilvls below me overnight. It made it near impossible for me to accomplish tasks that I have been doing in raid for the better part of a year. The problem also exists at lvl 100 on beta, and it wasn't until 6.0 dropped and parses showing the issues were posted that the problems were acknowledged. <br />
<br />
They are over nerfing and over buffing some classes right now, but the difference between bottom and top is significantly smaller than it was. Prior to changes the bottom was simming roughly half what the top was and actual parses were showing those sims to be pretty freaking accurate. That was the concern. It causes entire classes to be benched on mythic teams. Good players in most cases were suddenly unable to perform at the level required all because of mistakes made on balancing. It's still not where it needs to be, but it's better, and after a few more tuning passes it will be closer.<br />
<br />
This isn't about competition over dps to everyone. For someone like me it's about avoiding having to force people to reroll for FoTM because that's not fun gameplay.</div></div><hr />

Hunters are not fine and Shadow Priests should shut their collective dirty mouths. If they wanted to be DPS, they should re-spec to their DPS spec, Warlock. Shadow Priest is a leveling spec so priests can heal raids.It was never intended to be anything but a support spec and now that it is gone it's time for Shadow Priests to move on and play the intended DPS spec for priests, Warlock.</div></div><hr />
