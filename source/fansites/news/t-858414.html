&quot;Salamander Hunter&quot; and Crimson Fire Hawk<br />
The new model of Ragnaros was very popular yesterday, let's kick it up a notch with the model of Crimson Fire Hawk (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/97493/crimson-fire-hawk/) and a new monster, the &quot;Salamander Hunter&quot; (who looks a lot like Majordomo Executus (http://www.wowpedia.org/Majordomo_Executus)).<br />

<br />
<br />
Guild Recruitment<br />
Patch 4.1 will apparently introduce the in-game guild recruitment system promised during Blizzcon! So far we don't have a lot of details on how it will work but the interface can be accessed on PTRs, we'll probably see more of it in later phases of testing. <br />

I think that it will be used in the same way trade chat is atm. I figure people will just use it to find people and then move on from there as normal.<br />

<br />
Yeah of course, we will advertise our guild with that feature and it will most likely give us a lot of potential recruits. It is gonna be the first thing a lot of player resort to when looking for a new guild. I guess it will turn some people off since they would be going from the convenience that that tool brings to web applications and such which is a bit of a hassle. But I guess that's always been the case, nothing new to it.</div></div><hr />

We have both the Reins of the Crimson Fire Hawk and Reins of the Beryl Fire Hawk. I do not think it was by accident that the names were so similar.

Tcg never brings out 2 epic flying mounts and won't ever do it with items which almost share exactly the same name. My argument is the same for the store thing. We would have had the one alone.

So we might see some QQ from most going with the usual arguement that only 0.5% of the population will get that mount, even with new patches and better gear.<br />

Then again it could be a rare drop from a &quot;Firehawk&quot; boss in the raid instance or Raggy himself on both normal and hardmode.</div></div><hr />

What's the bet that a little note drops off Ragnaros that has a code on it, which you can then use to unlock the mount on the Blizzstore.. and then you have to spend $25 to claim it. I would har.. I would hardy har har.<br />

Of course I'm just completely joking, we all know Blizzard are in this to make the world a better place rather than for the money. Mount does look awesome though. It just makes me want to take a bath in honey while watching midget pron :3</div></div><hr />

combining what several people have mentioned and some info from mmochamp my fair bet is that it is the 125/150 mount reward. there's two versions, crimson and beryl (a la blue dragonhawl/red dragonhawk),while beryl is a gemstone that's usually associated with the color blue. in addition, the ptr notes include the addition of new mini-pet achieves, so it's completely fair to deduce new mount achieves as well. and if that is indeed the case i will be perfectly happy with it, as it will be obtainable through a reasonable amount of work, but not insanely ungettable or disgustingly common, eg the red dragonhawk was rare enough to comment on but still not impossible to get.<br />

Anyways, the mount looks good but I prefer mounts with more cryptic colourations (ie: mechanical mounts like the flying machines and mimiron's head). I try not to get too attached to mounts; I don't want to end up as one of the people that makes an ass out of themselves when they RAGE after losing a mount roll against 24 other people, along with the other 23 people also raging at the winner or something lol.<br />
<br />
And I hope to god it's not going to be a blizzstore mount simply because I don't want my screen glowing orange when I log into org or SW.<br />

<br />
If that mount ends up on the Blizzard Store I will end my subscription without hesitation.<br />

<br />
But lets think it in theory...<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a red (Crimson) and a Green/Blue (Beryl). My bet is on faction-related. <br />
<br />
<br />
Options:<br />
<br />
1) Same as Dragonhawk. You get with quantity of other mounts.<br />
2) A boss in the new raids faction-related and has a chance of dropping them.<br />

This patch finally gives the possibility to cast spells on key down instead of key up, making you more awesome in raids and battlegrounds! <br />
<br />
•ACTION_BUTTON_USE_KEY_DOWN = &quot;Cast action keybinds on key down&quot;;<br />
•OPTION_TOOLTIP_ACTION_BUTTON_USE_KEY_DOWN = &quot;Action button keybinds will respond on key down, rather than on key up.&quot;;<br />
Im not that much into macros, but does this mean we can make macro with both key-down and key-up ? meaning 2 instant casts 1 hit ?</div></div><hr />

Mark my words it will be free to play. How do you get even more of a player base? Make it free to play with optional fees and vanity items and xp gain services you can pay for. It is a smarter model for their future mmo too. Just wait and see it unfold my friend.<br />

On a side note I think that mount could possibly a rep reward from a new faction.</div></div><hr />

Yes, right. The world does not work that way. Do you see any bank exes who got their 100 Million bonus do that? No? And lets also not forget that Blizzard is not independant but part of Activision. The *only* situation where they would make WoW &quot;free to play&quot; is if they could get through other means (which they also cannot implement without making it free to play) MORE money from it.<br />

This could be it or some of these new mounts going to appear on store. Celestial Steed was released on April 15, 2010, so assuming 4.1 is going to be on PTR full march and going on live on April then it would be about year when last mount was released in store.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This shows the level of player that WoW has, how lucky blizzard is to have mindless servants, and why they get away with recycling stuff like mad. This game will go F2P once Titan comes out, maybe even a year after. You naive people seem to forget that blizzard isn't blizzard anymore. They're lazy and money hungry. Add in that they have to report to Bobby Kotick, 1+1=2.</div></div><hr />

Key down = when you press the key<br />
Key up = when you release the key<br />
Currently spells gets cast when you release a key*. As long as you hold the key down nothing happens until you release it.<br />

<br />
The best way to maximise profits in this situation is to do just what they did with the Ashes of A'lar and Invincible: Make the mount extremely difficult to get to begin with and then release an easier way of getting the same model (Luck Vs Hard Work for Ashes, Hard Work Vs Cash for Invincible).</div></div><hr />

Actually, no. I quit during 4.0.3 due to the disastrous way they handled ret paladin (my class of choice), and I'll quit again if they charge money for this mount.

Still it's a nice addition. And might also lower the recruitment msg's on trade or general for example. But it does cater towards the more casual player.</div></div><hr />

We have both the Reins of the Crimson Fire Hawk and Reins of the Beryl Fire Hawk. I do not think it was by accident that the names were so similar. I would deduct that this would imply that it will not be a tcg mount nor a store mount. Why? Tcg never brings out 2 epic flying mounts and won't ever do it with items which almost share exactly the same name. My argument is the same for the store thing. We would have had the one alone. So this might be the raid achievement mounts like frostrbrood and bloodbathed I would guess since they shared the same &quot;type&quot; of mount. Since 10 and 25 is also the same thing now in terms of loot and items I doubt it is a Ragna mount to be honest. Other option could be possibly being faction type mounts , but I find that highly unlikely.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowtcgloot.com/x51_netherrocket.htm<br />
<br />
They aren't both &quot;Epic&quot; but they are both flying mounts that have similar names. And if I remember right, the Epic flying Blazing Hippogryph and the Wooly Rhino both came from the same set, both epic mounts even if one was only a ground mount.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It ain't beautiful if it ain't precious.<br />
<br />
It would make it greater just to watch all hardcore raiders cry for not having themselves another &quot;Super cool mount all to themselves&quot; Its why I still love the Celestial Steed. 8]</div></div><hr />

The model designer for Salamander Hunter needs to be reassigned to Ragnaros to do Ragnaros justice. In fact, I think Ragnaros having a serpent-like propulsion system makes more sense to me than legs. Fire glides and slithers.</div></div><hr />

Isn't it obvious? They've released different version rewards for alliance and horde before. Alliance color is blue. Horde color is red. Think about it...<br />
<br />
EDIT: Regardless of where they come from, one is Alliance and one is Horde. And not that I think it will come from the store, but people keep saying they wouldn't release two different versions of something in the store. Anyone remember the moonkin hatchling that came out not that long ago? There's an Alliance and Horde version of that. Just saying...</div></div><hr />

That mount is going to be from heroic Raganros, id say its pretty blatantly obvious because of the whole fire aspect of it.<br />

They're saying it looks like zapdos because it does, zapdos has sharp pointy wings just like the hawk. Moltres has long flowly flames. <br />

For example, if you were to visit a mailbox and type in: yourcharname-server it would mail the heirlooms to your character on that server.
