<br />
<br />
<br />
Racials<br />
Mag'har Orc racials are currently unknown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mounts<br />
The Mag'har Orc racial mount is the Mag'har Direwolf (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/267274-maghar-direwolf).<br />
<br />
<br />
Native to Draenor, these wolves are preferred by the Mag'har for their ferocity, loyalty, and for something to snuggle on those cool winter nights.<br />

<br />
Jokes, Flirts, and VO<br />
We currently only have a limited amount of flirts and jokes for the Mag'har Orcs datamined.<br />
Female<br />
You don't need a Dark Portal... you've already invaded my heart.<br />
Any idea if Saurfang is single? He's got that silver fox thing going on...<br />
A green orc gave me a candy heart that said &quot;I fel for you.&quot; I told him he could keep his demon's blood and clobbered him with my mace.<br />
Last person to hit on me learned what &quot;hitting on&quot; really means.<br />
A Bleeding Hollow shaman just flirted with me. At least, I think he did. Either he was winking suggestively or he had just sacrificed an eye.<br />
Just because I'm enjoying your company doesn't mean I don't also want to punch you.<br />
Before we go any further, I need to know... How high is your pain threshold?<br />
<br />
Hey... aren't you the one who left that abandoned garrison littering up Frostfire?<br />
Azeroth has so many rules about who you can stab, who you can't stab... who you can punch, who you can't punch... You guys need to loosen up!<br />
The Shattered Hand are legendary warriors, but don't ever ask one of them for a back rub. Trust me on this one... &lt; pained sounds &gt;<br />
Enough of this wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey... BLAH! Just let me smash stuff!<br />
I dyed my hair green once. Warchief Hellscream was NOT amused.<br />
You can call me uncorrupted, but I prefer to think of myself as an organic orc.<br />
Drahnor. Draynor? Draanur. Draenor. &lt; Sigh &gt;. I'm just gonna say I'm from Outland.<br />
<br />
Male<br />
Is your mother a fire elemental? Because you are smokin' hot!<br />
Care to take a walk with me in the Shadowmoonlight?<br />
Baby, I'm gonna Blackrock your world.<br />
You're not just good looking... you're mok'gora-gous!<br />
My safe word is &quot;zug-zug&quot;.<br />
I'm a sensitive guy. Please don't break my mag'heart.<br />
You must be a Frostwolf, because you've made tracks to my heart.<br />
<br />
I never met Gul'dan, but I hear he was a nightmare at parties. Always trying to spike the punch bowl...<br />
Azeroth goes through warchiefs like Draenor goes through alternate timelines.<br />
The Laughing Skull clan booed me off the stage at the comedy club. With a name like that, you'd think they'd have a sense of humor!<br />
Try spending a few decades trapped on a planet with fanatical draenei and see how YOU like it!<br />
Ahhhhhh! The chiropractor in Orgrimmar has done wonders for my back.<br />
Stay frosty, my wolves.<br />
My favorite kind of music? Blackrock n' Roll, of course! &lt; guitar sounds &gt;<br />
<br />
<br />

It is unclear how they come back into play for Battle for Azeroth, but they are likely to be an Allied Race for the Horde and feature the option for an unhunched posture.<br />

Can we stop with the AU thing.... These are probably Mag'har from Outlands that thrall openly welcomed into the horde awhile ago, leave the AU crap out of it. Hell, they even have a connected reputation... AU doesn't.</div></div><hr />

The skin colors shown represent the clans from the AU story some of which no longer exist in outland... so, might be time to take off those rose tinted glasses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And have what exactly? There are barely any legitimate Clans left on Outland to base an allied race off of, it'd be like implementing another Orc race with one difference, they're now brown, which means there's no grey, variations of grey, Blackrock etc. I don't get this argument for MU/Outland Orcs, there's not enough diverse options to base it off of. Atleast with AU Orcs you have a lot of active clans to design skintones off of.</div></div><hr />

Yup sorry mate, hate to burst your little bubble but these are in fact the scattered clans left behind in the AU Draenor, and are referred to as Mag'har since that translates to uncorrupted.</div></div><hr />

A LOT OF THE CLANS DIED OFF! Read up on your lore perhaps, may want to start with the Orcish word Mag'har too because it literally is a word in Orcish which translates to uncorrupted. It can be applied to any Orc with no fel afflicted skin.</div></div><hr />

All people wanted was brown skinned orcs, fits perfectly with the remaining Mag'har from outlands. Hell there's technically not that many Draenei left from the exodar but you can create infinite of them.</div></div><hr />

There's nothing to work with on Outland, though. Most of the &quot;uncorrupted&quot; Orcs nowadays are either Sick, Old, or Half Ogre. AU Draenor was their only true Option to go with.</div></div><hr />

The only brown Orcs that remain are in that little town of Garadar, that's pretty much their population which is by no means much of an army to be an Allied race. Mag'har on Outland are pretty much only fit to be included/lumped in with the original Orcs by giving them a brown skin option, there's not nearly enough to warrant making Outland Orcs an Allied race whereas with Draenor Orcs you have the clans still alive and kicking, with plenty of options for customisation because each clan had distinct physical features.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which was attacked during an Alliance questline, you're ordered to collect Mag'har prayer beads from the orcs in that particular camp. I wouldn't really call it a city. Blizzard goes against a lot of things they've said in the past, I've just come to accept that they say and do different things, though to be quite honest it's not as if they're making us spend more than 20 minutes back in AU Draenor anyway, most of the Allied Race quest chains are pretty damn short. They know a lot of fans have wanted the ability to look like the Orcs from WoD aswell, so I'd say it's more a fan service.</div></div><hr />

Everything else are just pieces of a once amazingly written lore. I'm not saying,that seeing legendary clan leaders such as Grom,Durotar,Blackhand etc. was not cool, but i'm getting a feeling,that current Blizzard dev team regrets killing them off so badly,that they are ready to screw all the sense in the current lore,only to bring them back in the game.</div></div><hr />

It's a toggle. Hunch is default because they use the Orc player model with customization. All orcs can choose to be straight backed if they want. They aren't exclusively straight backed like Zandalari are.</div></div><hr />

They do. It's just that in model viewers they always retain the standard face geometry. I can load my Orc to the Wowhead viewer and it wont look like it does in-game. So they will have same faces as the green orcs have in-game, don't worry! :)</div></div><hr />

Source for &quot;Blizzard stating nothing from AU would come to MU&quot; please. Sounds pretty funny considering we got Gul'dan.<br />
<br />
And orcs from outland would not work because:<br />
<br />
1). there are not enough of them<br />
2). most, if not all of them came to azeroth with garrosh, you know - their current leader at the time of TBC</div></div><hr />

Good luck finding a source on that. Especially since all of Legion is AU Gul'dan's fault.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm glad Draenor is staying relevant. I know everyone hated WoD, but let's be honest: hype for the setting was at a fever pitch before it launched, and the first couple of months were well-liked. WoD's problem wasn't the setting; it was the lack of patch support that destroyed that expansion's reputation.<br />
<br />
Plus, keeping Draenor relevant means we're likely going to go back eventually to Farahlon and the Southern Continent and find out what was up with all of the Void shenanigans that was left open-ended in WoD.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard also said for years that they had no intention of doing Classic Vanilla servers either. Nothing is ever etched in stone and Blizzard most certainly has the right to change course on prior positions.<br />

I think the difference is beyond obvious to anyone with at least two brain cells. The brown orcs (uncorrupted orcs) have a ton of backstory and lore, have been present in the game since the first expansion, and have been expanded even further with the WoD expansion. Whereas the lightforged draenei (your comparison) have existed for only one single content patch of one expansion, and have little to no lore or development.<br />
<br />
Comparing brown orcs to lightforged draenei is like comparing a character like Luke Skywalker to a random bartender of one of the cantinas we see in the movies.<br />

<br />
Because they want to give Dark Iron and Wildhammer more distinctive cultures, voice acting, and customization options. It means you may have to wait longer, but when the inevitable Wildhammer Allied Race comes, they'll be more distinct and robust with their own hairstyles, tattoos, mounts, etc.</div></div><hr />

Brown orcs have also been asked for for YEARS, I may not agree with the implementation of them, but you can't deny that people have wanted them more than any &quot;sub&quot; or &quot;allied&quot; racial option.</div></div><hr />

The Laughing Skull skins come close, but there isn't really a pure pale white Shattered Hand skin. No specific Shadowmoon-style facepaint either, but the Bleeding Hollow skins work reasonably well.<br />
<br />
I believe all the Shattered Hand orcs had unique custom models, whereas these skins are technically the orc model's NPC skins from WoD. I think that’s why some of the details are a bit lower resolution.<br />
<br />
Hope they maybe modify them a bit more before release.</div></div><hr />

The Horde is the faction that encounters the Vulpera and quests through their zone. They're also a rather vicious Nomadic people and beastly, so why people are assuming that they're going Alliance is weird...</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I'm not fine with is Grom being their leader.<br />
<br />
- He ended the peaceful coexistence between the AU Draenor Orcs and Draenai when he went full dictator mode as he created his Iron Horde.<br />
- Beyond the atrocities his Iron Horde committed to the Draenai, they also attacked other Orc Clans that didn't fall in line (i.e. Frostwolves)<br />
- He then led a failed invasion of Azeroth, against both the Alliance AND the Horde, which doesn't speak to his leadership.<br />
- Even worse, he then failed to even maintain control of his Iron Horde, losing it to Gul'dan and allowing it to become yet another Fel Horde.<br />
- Then, after fighting to the top of HFC and finding his sorry ass chained up, he conveniently does a full heel face turn, acting like he's on our side, despite us being the ones that destroyed his army and killed 'his' son?<br />
- And finally, he is standing there next to Yrel, representative of the people his Iron Horde had been happily raping and murdering, and had the gall to declare that Draenor is free?<br />
<br />
Yeah, fuck that guy. <br />
<br />
And that leads me to the biggest problem I have, which is that I find it hard to believe the surviving Mag'har Orcs of Draenor would trust their fates in the hand of someone with such a shitty track record. Especially when you consider that Durotan is the leader of the Frostwolves. His clan was never broken, nor gave in to the Fel. They are the ones that the Horde players allied with, and the Frostwolves were never our enemy.<br />
<br />
Make Durotan the Mag'har leader before that overhyped failure.</div></div><hr />
