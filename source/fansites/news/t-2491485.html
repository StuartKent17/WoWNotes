Heads up! The current season of activities in Mythic Keystone Dungeons and PvP is ending soon.<br />
<br />
This will mean an end to all players’ opportunities to earn seasonal rewards and titles, as well as the end of seasonal rankings for BFA Season 2.<br />
<br />
For two weeks following the end-of-season, we will have an off-season. During that two weeks period, Mythic Keystone dungeons will still be playable using Season 2 affixes and rewards, but their seasonal achievements will no longer be available. In PvP during that two week period, players still queue for rated PvP and earn appropriate rewards, but the PvP leaderboards will be locked.<br />
<br />
Good luck fighting to a glorious finish of the season!</div></div><hr />

<br />
end of a season, start of new season usually happens with raid.<br />
however 8.1 the season went straight to raid, meaning no gap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is literally two possible dates now, either next week, or the one after that (probably that). Just make plans for either option, and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only really see the 25th as a possible release date if have the be on this side of the 4th of July holiday. <br />
<br />
Every other possible day interferes with the 4th.:<br />
<br />
11th of June: Mythic raid is released two days before the 4th. <br />
<br />
18th of June: Raid and new seasons is released two days before the 4th.<br />
<br />
25th of June: One week of bug fixing before the 4th. Raid hits on the 9th.<br />
<br />
2nd of July: Patch is released two days before the 4th.<br />
<br />
9th of July: The patch would have to be finalised first day back from the 4th holiday.<br />
<br />
16th of July: Best guess for release date after the 4th.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't seem to be accurate at all. https://mmo-population.com/r/ffxiv/<br />
<br />
They have Total Population at around 13,5M, when actual Total Population is over 16M<br />
<br />

<br />
If you want the official confirmation, look up for the last FFXIV Live Letter LI on youtube</div></div><hr />

So from a another quick google.<br />
<br />
LONDON (24th May 2019) – The global community of FINAL FANTASY® XIV Online continues to grow as SQUARE ENIX® announces the game has now surpassed 16 million registered users worldwide during a Letter from the Producer LIVE segment streamed from San Francisco. The new figure marks a high-point for the MMORPG ahead of the release of its third major expansion, FINAL FANTASY XIV: Shadowbringers™ on 2nd July 2019.<br />
<br />
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2019-05-24/final-fantasy-xiv-online-surpasses-16-million-players-worldwide/.147102<br />
<br />
Unless you have some where that says this is subs and not just accounts it’s still over 94 million behind wow.<br />
<br />
Your link also doesn’t work.</div></div><hr />

What a joke, i'm baffled you actually think that any game gets even close to WoW numbers after 15 years.<br />
How about you readup?<br />
