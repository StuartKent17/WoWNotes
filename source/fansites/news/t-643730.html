Ulduar - 25-Man First Kills<br />
Ulduar is now open and we can start tracking World First kills! There is also temporary Ulduar US First Kills (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?board=39.0) and Ulduar EU First Kills (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?board=37.0) forums for guilds who wants to post about their kills before they hit the front page. The Flame Leviathan, Ignis, and Razorscale were killed very fast by a lot of guilds and it's hard to figure out who got the World First kills, I'm working on it. <br />
<br />
Update - US and EU Rankings are now split. A new forum has been created and there are now 2 first kills forums:<br />
Ulduar US First Kills (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?board=39.0)<br />
Ulduar EU First Kills (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?board=37.0)<br />

<br />
Conflagrate damage reduction<br />
We are hotfixing Conflagrate to do 70% of Immolate's total periodic damage instantly (down from 100%). The tooltip may still say 100%, so we didn't want this to feel like a stealth nerf.<br />
<br />
Since there are so many threads on the topic, it was hard to pick a single one to post this in.<br />
<br />
We want for warlocks to have some burst potential, but we feel like it is too high. We don't want the lock playstyle to be the &quot;run around and drop people with huge nukes&quot; gimmick that we have already tried to tone down in say Arcane mages. We don't want to push all warlocks, even in PvP, towards Destruction just to get these big hits or crits. Even if you are &quot;only&quot; getting 5K crits off of an instant spell, it will still be a great button to push. <br />
<br />
Recent In-Game Fixes - 4/15/09<br />
Listed below are recent fixes we have applied to the game.<br />
<br />
4/15/09<br />
We have altered XT-002 Deconstructor's heart aggro radius down to 60 yards so players will no longer get stuck in combat when at the entrance to his room.<br />
The trash mobs before XT-002 Deconstructor have temporarily been disabled. These mobs will return in the future after we have resolve the issue with them being linked.<br />
Shattering a Construct during the Ignis the Furnace Master encounter will now decrease the number of Strength of the Creator stack buffs he has by one.<br />
You can no longer check the box to make your character “at war” with the Sunreavers faction.<br />
Upon completion of the quest “The Last Line of Defense” you will continue to the proper phase for the story in Icecrown.<br />
We have hotfixed the damage of the Warlock spell Conflagrate from 100% to 70% of Immolate’s total periodic damage instantly. The tooltip may still show 100% until a future update though.<br />
Death knights casting Reaping will no longer cause Pestilence to convert 2 Blood Runes into Death Runes.<br />
The Dark Rune Sentinels in the 10 player Razorscale encounter have had hit points and damage reduced.<br />
The effects of Meltdown will no longer be able to be bypassed by using Divine Shield.<br />
Each difficulty level of Flame Leviathon’s hard modes have had the boss’s health increased.<br />
We have temporarily removed Emblems of Valor and Emblems of Conquest from all levels of difficulty from the chest, Freya's Gift, that you receive upon completion of the Freya encounter. We will restore these in a future patch when the issue has been resolved.<br />
The enrage time for the Razorscale encounter has been increased to 10 minutes.<br />
The Dark Rune Watchers will no longer cast chain lightning while moving.<br />
Elemental Mastery will no longer allow a player to cast 2 spells instantly.<br />
Ignis the Furnace Master should no longer melee attack the players he is picking up.<br />
<br />
Current Ulduar Issues Update<br />
<br />
Siege Engines that use Steam Rush while on a ramp sometimes fall through the world.<br />
We currently have no fix for this, the workaround is simply to not cast Steam Rush on the ramps. The ability works fine in the Flame Leviathan fight and other flat ground.<br />
<br />
The two trash pulls in front of XT-002 Deconstructor are linked.<br />
UPDATE: We've disabled the XT-002 Deconstructor Trash, but the hotfix will not despawn currently spawned trash. A soft instance reset should hopefully find the trash no longer present, but it's also possible the fix might require a full server restart.<br />
<br />
Shattering an Iron Construct in the Ignis the Furnace Master encounter does not properly reduce the number of stacks of Strength of the Creator on Ignis.<br />
UPDATE: This has been hotfixed so that shattering a Construct removes one stack application of Strength of the Creator.<br />
<br />
There are reports that players are being melee'd by Ignis while in the slag pot.<br />
We're investigating this.</div></div><hr />

Not really. It's just there are some guilds populated by wow-addicted players. By &quot;addicted&quot; I mean people who really love this game more than anything else. Think about BigRedKitty (http://www.bigredkitty.net/) who had to close his blog and game addiction because his wife was almost killing him (not to mention his son). He was not even THAT addicted to start clearing a raid in less than 24 hours... so you can imagine how deeply they're involved with this game. It's like having a second job more than just a game.</div></div><hr />

This is how any MMO game works. The fun thing is people complain about the game after years of gameplay. It's not like players pay one month and get bored. They pay for years and in the end they complain about repetitive stuff. Games with infinite fun/news do not exist. Games with constant updates and free content do.</div></div><hr />

When we all talk about World First we use the phrase as among ALL continents.<br />
With your logic saying that is not the case. Well then the first PTR guild had world first.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
I personally don't care but I know many does. There are always a race going on in WOW. It can be between the horde/alliance on your realms or it can be between US/EU guilds.<br />
I enjoy the race and many ppl take the races pretty serious and out of respect for them naming should be appropriate :)<br />

Ulduar was barely playable when servers went up, some of them went down again, etc ... It's pretty much impossible to track. <br />
<br />
If everything goes well, in a few hours you will see US people complaining because EU players had more time to raid because their servers went up at 03:00PM local time while they had to wait for 08:00PM on their side. :p<br />
<br />
I'll update with a World / EU / US ranking anyway. But as long as the United States are part of the world, they're world first kill.</div></div><hr />

The problem is not EU/US but the achievement itself. &quot;World first&quot; is correct on a single-server based game such as EvE Online but not in a scenario where the game got hundreds of servers on different time zones. That's all. <br />
<br />
But let's be honest: at the end of the day who really cares about that? Having an achievement that states you're a completely addicted player makes you look &quot;great&quot; among other addicted players only. Normal/casual players will look at you like a nerd ;-)</div></div><hr />

You did not get it mate: in my case I added HEAVY irony to my reply ;). What I said later on this thread is that &quot;WORLD&quot; is used in a wrong way because this is a game based on multiple servers. It would work on EvE Online or any other single-server based game where everyone runs for the flag starting at the same time. I do not give a peanut if Yankees will get it before Europeans :). It's just a fact that &quot;world&quot; in this case is not 100% world. Is USA only.</div></div><hr />

When WotLK came out you guys had an 18 hour headstart. Vodka cleared naxx in 2 hours flat on there first run at 80 and became world 18th and what did you europeans say????<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it's cause we're leet and better and overall better players LUL&quot;<br />
<br />
Now the tables have turned and it's OMG US firsts not fair they got a headstart!!!!!<br />
<br />
Is it fair? No..... should it count .... NO!<br />
<br />
Should your european times counted before when you guys were all ranked guilds at the top cause you got a headstart .......... NO! But it did........ and we were cool and let it slide.<br />
<br />
The bias here.... is sickening......<br />
<br />
<br />
Dude, the point is: IF we talk of world firsts, the guild that earns this title would definately be an european guild, cuz we ARE better than you ...that's just the whole point. We &gt; You, EU &gt; US, blizz just wants to cheer you guys up with your fake firsts and giving us an extended downtime :&gt;</div></div><hr />

What I said later on this thread is that &quot;WORLD&quot; is used in a wrong way because this is a game based on multiple servers. It would work on EvE Online or any other single-server based game where everyone runs for the flag starting at the same time. I do not give a peanut if Yankees will get it before Europeans :). It's just a fact that &quot;world&quot; in this case is not 100% world. Is USA only.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is true........ however you go to wowjutsu, or wowprogress report and what does it show???<br />
<br />
Euro, Euro, Euro, Euro, Euro, ect.<br />
<br />
A lot of these top ranked guilds can be attributed to getting the head start.<br />
<br />
Would US beat out european servers??? No of course not..... Ensidia did it in like a day.<br />
<br />
But Vodka... perhaps it could have stole 7th or 8th versus the 18th it is now if you gave them an 18 hour headstart.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is...... the system has never been fair and it's been against us all this time. To now turn and whine about it after we've accepted it this way is in itself not fair.<br />
<br />
You want fair???? Tell all websites to have a european and us rankings them have them never merge us together.<br />
<br />
It's not like Ensidia won't world first alagon anyways.</div></div><hr />

Crimson seem to be a guild of commited players - there is a death knight with the 40+ exalted rep achievement, you don't get that by playing once a week for a couple of hours lol.<br />

Most guilds that have played together for a few months and have the level of gear that crimson have will be able to kill the same bosses and have it on farm before the month is out, but then they will QQ about easy content and being bored etc etc etc.<br />

<br />
i can see that content is not easy at all this time around, as Crimson scored few kills on easy mode in normal difficulty with 25 man gear i presume, they should have it on farm anyway so /care.<br />
<br />
we have one hard mode report, and first and vehicle based at that...<br />
<br />
who cares if US they had headstart they won't be touching algalon or youg for some time it seems, as serious guilds will focus on hard modes anyway. <br />
<br />
only grats from me goes to insomnia gj.<br />
<br />
<br />
ps. seems that crimson got first road block on first hard boss(Mimiron)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xentropy</div><div class="date">2009-04-15, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But wait, until China gets Wrath and 3.1, no one can claim a world first, right? I mean, we need to see how much time they take from server up to first kill.<br />
<br />
Either:<br />
A) Keep everything separate. Have a US first and a EU first and an &lt;insert Asian country&gt; first etc. and call NONE a world first. Ever. No one can ever claim to be world first, because some country somewhere doesn't have WoW and may at some time in the future.<br />
B) Merge them and call whoever was earliest of whoever's out so far world first. (Which for the next 12+ hours would make these US firsts also world firsts.)<br />
<br />
Which is it?<br />
<br />
Of course, there's also an issue of stability. The US downtime was supposed to be 8 hours and became about 15. European downtime is STARTING at 14 hours, and finishing earlier in the afternoon local time. This means two probable results:<br />
1) Europeans will have more time before people get sleepy in the middle of the night to work on firsts, and will be less tired even at the start.<br />
2) The European servers are likely to be more stable when they first come up than the US servers were, for two further reasons:<br />
a) Longer downtime already accounted for means Blizzard can double, triple, and quadruple-check the servers before they even think about turning them back on, without millions of people pounding the login servers starting 7 hours before the downtime's done because it wasn't &quot;supposed to&quot; last so long.<br />
b) They learned what issues the patch had during US deployment and can use that knowledge to make the European deployment smoother.<br />
<br />
So even if a European first takes say 4 hours from server up and a US first took 6, if the servers were so laggy there were 2 hours worth of world server downs and restarts during those 6 hours for the US guild, but no instance crashes at 2% for the European guild like the US guild had to deal with, is that really a &quot;win&quot; for the Europeans or just a tie?<br />
<br />
Bottom line, just get over it and enjoy the game for what it's supposed to be: FUN. Remember fun?</div></div><hr />

yes they did go into the ptr and get ulduar on farm, just like every other raid guild with 3 drakes down and nothing to do<br />

and also, they didnt do 10 man, they did 25 and once again didnt even attempt mimiron yet, they stopped there because thats the end of their normal raid time, picking it up tommorow and blast thru yogg<br />

I agree with you. But you can apply the same theory to Soccer, Football, Basketball, etc. Any kind of &quot;passion&quot; will become a second job for someone. Speaking of my country (Italy) where almost anyone talks about soccer 90% of the day... I really cannot understand how a husband can leave the wife EVERY SINGLE weekend to travel to another city just to see his team playing. And then come back FIGHTING against the other team fans... on the train. That's beyond me. But it happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
QFT. And it's basically confirmed by the front page; the number of guilds killing those first few bosses will be REALLY high. And the later bosses, while more difficult, aren't going to be impossible with best-in-slot(until that point) gear. The only thing deciding which guilds are getting world firsts on most of these is how late they're willing to stay up to learn the encounters, and how long their server is up for (with the EU servers not being up yet anyway). This is only due to the number of bosses in there; if a guild is taking 30 minutes on each boss, that's 7 hours in total, which is a lot longer than the average weekday raid. So far, even the US servers havn't been up for that long.<br />
<br />
The only boss kill worth watching for is Algalon (and possibly the hard-mode bosses leading up to there). Let's see how many of these top guilds kill it in the first week.</div></div><hr />

Umm the main reason for that and the reason crimson rolled every kill past Xt is that Xt trash was bugged, all linked together, and unkillable. Crimson got lucky early on and downed the boss without the trash pulling during the add phases, which happened like 9/10 boss attempts, a tiny handful of guilds got past Xt - through luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This actually makes me curious. Is it theoretically possible to unlock Algalon on week one? If a guild decides to ONLY do hard mode kills of every single boss? If so, are any guilds actually doing this? Foregoing easy mode firsts to get hard mode firsts, across the board? Seems like it'd be a more meaningful use of time for the top guilds than racing to kill easy bosses 147 minutes after servers come up instead of 160.</div></div><hr />

If everything goes well, in a few hours you will see US people complaining because EU players had more time to raid because their servers went up at 03:00PM local time while they had to wait for 08:00PM on their side. :p<br />
<br />
I'll update with a World / EU / US ranking anyway. But as long as the United States are part of the world, they're world first kill. <br />
<br />
<br />
In the same way the US has World Series Baseball.... when only the US play. Lol. It amuses the rest of the world when stupid yanks have got their head shoved way up their ass. Personally, I couldn't give a crap about world firsts. This is purely my amusement at certainly people perpetuating the American stereotype (not directed at Boubouille directly, there's plenty of it around) of &quot;we're number 1!!!&quot; when it's been pretty clear previously that in most cases when faced with competition from the rest of the world on something like a level playing field you tend to fail (relative to the size of the country and the people in it and pretty much any world played sport you wish to mention vs other, smaller nations; bigger country, larger pool to pull your team from, still tend to loose).</div></div><hr />

Time passes , and one day the next instance is ready for launch.

<br />
<br />
7 kills are already on the main page, 1 is razorscale (i guess) but they didn't manage to get it before Clearly Outplayed...<br />
<br />
so i guess they killed Flame Leviathan?This or my math sucks ballz!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calaba</div><div class="date">2009-04-15, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This actually makes me curious. Is it theoretically possible to unlock Algalon on week one? If a guild decides to ONLY do hard mode kills of every single boss? If so, are any guilds actually doing this? Foregoing easy mode firsts to get hard mode firsts, across the board? Seems like it'd be a more meaningful use of time for the top guilds than racing to kill easy bosses 147 minutes after servers come up instead of 160.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well we don't really know yet do we :) <br />
But theoretically, probably. It's unlikely that Blizzard will make any of the 4 bosses needed to unlock it impossible to kill. <br />
I'm sure some some guilds will be going for it, especially EU guilds that are going for EU / world first clear, or hard-mode-firsts. Especially as it looks like all the other bosses are going to be killed on US servers before the EU ones are even up!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I highly doubt Algalon will drop a T8 token (unless it's extras, like Gluth), since he's hard-mode-only, and the sheer volume of QQ that'd come from not being able to get all 5 pieces of T8 without having to do major hard modes would make Blizzard backpedal crazy fast anyway.<br />

<br />
hahahah...right...<br />
US maintenance took an EXTRA 6 hours after the servers were meant to be up....like 15 hours total or something..then the servers all went down for another hour..then 2 out of the 4 bosses were bugged and a massive block for 90% of guilds. And now US servers are having another maintenance.<br />
<br />
<br />
At least you guys get the ignis/Xt hotfix at server up, then you can get world firsts on ignis and claim it's legit even though it was bugged for us and impossible.</div></div><hr />

This is the best representation of a first so far. As on my realm (Arthas US) it was difficult to stay online, let alone get a raid going. Once it was done however, my mage ended up getting stuck in a VoA25 which crashed. Making any chance for an Arthas guild (TG, SECURITY, Hidden, and so on) nearly impossible.<br />
<br />
I don't think an accurate representation of firsts goes to guilds who have a working server. (have to stick up for my EU buddies across the pond.) However, I do congratulate the good guilds that server hopped to the right battle group that worked fine on the patch. Good job.</div></div><hr />

Sure it was a &quot;hard core&quot; guild however Was a very late start due to the very long maintenance, servers were very unstable and when they were up very laggy. That being said how many guilds would have cleared just as many if not more if everything would have been perfect? At this rate, I give it 2-3 weeks TOPS before most of the top guilds have cleared the whole place and have it on farm.... sad IMO.</div></div><hr />

PVE takes no skill today (havent seen Ulduar hard mode, but so far im not impressed with what ive seen or heared).<br />
<br />
Or just bring the hardmode raid prequests back so its actually challenging to get an entire guild ready for raid. I remember feeling uber pro after having done all raid pre quests while 95% of my server did not. Ah well, good old times i gues.</div></div><hr />

Yes, while world records can be attempted at any time, world firsts will never be as fair and will always be a lottery, so enjoy it. Except where all competitors get stuck at certain point and more skill than time is required to get further (like on a non-PTR boss).<br />
<br />
But assuming that new Naxx is easier than raids of earlier expansions, and Ulduar is the tier above, then this is like the world first race for ... Prince Malchezaar and Nightbane?!</div></div><hr />

You gave the answer yourself, ~95% is not interested in the &quot;good old times&quot;.<br />
Todays &quot;uber pro&quot; feeling is achieved by getting one of the 310% protodrakes. If that's not good enough anymore then maybe it's time to quit WoW after all.</div></div><hr />

In the case of hunters, however, every survival hunter I look up, including one in my guild I can inspect in-game and see has the proper number of talent points, shows up with 87 talent points.

Blizzard has explained their reasoning for this several times, but I guess you just choose to ignore it.<br />

They don't do this because it makes no sense to spend time designing content that only a fraction of WoW players get to see. Hard-modes are the way to go these days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, ppl alread said that EU had headstarts too, even when world 1st WAS something. But let's consider some points:<br />
<br />
1) US servers up 1st, but down due to problems, lag, disconects, etc. too. So not that much advantage considering that some problems can be solved before happening in EU servers thanks to &quot;US 1st&quot;.<br />
<br />
2) Unless it's the only two encounters not avaiable on PTR, it's all bullshit and only &quot;do like they did on PTR video strat&quot;, so it doesn't exist &quot;world's 1st&quot; on those bosses. They've alread happened. Unless you want to do like &quot;world 1st logon and repeat strat before server down&quot; kills...<br />
<br />
3) Can't wait for those &quot;my gu1ld is bowred to deaf! GIEF 3.2!&quot; in less than a month from those guys...<br />
<br />
Also, it's really funny to watch stupid players rushing into &quot;vault of pinatavon&quot; and wiping on the new boss, lol. &quot;luzl uat? wehre my epiks?! why dis bosz doin'g? aoe!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Because u cant do more then 1 dmg on 1 hp dummy , simple yea ? :&gt;<br />

The reason some of these guilds are having such an easy time is because alot of guild decided to transfer/copy their toons onto the PTR for testing purposes. And, obviously with alot of practice over the last few weeks, it's not surprising to see these results.<br />
<br />
So, I will give props to those people who were smart enough to take advantage of this opportunity. <br />
<br />
EDIT: I do understand that the PTR servers came up and down during this time. But yet again, the hardcore players probably monitored this and logged in the minute the server stability allowed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excellent point :) Don't forget that hardcore players don't sleep the first week or two of a new patch or expansion release. This is probably the same thing that happened when WotLK was originally released. Don't be too surprised by the upcoming results.</div></div><hr />

As for QQ it being too easy.<br />
Lol.. No.<br />
Those few that are rushing content now for &quot;firsts lololol keke&quot; are the sad few that spent the last 2 months on the PTR farming the fights exactly for that purpose.<br />
They'll be done with the content and have nothing left to do other than QQ on the blizzard forums about lack of content, while they themselves pushed the content that fast.<br />
<br />
Also, those are the so called &quot;elite few&quot;, and there's genuinely good guilds among them.<br />
Your average guild, and slightly more casual guild will take a bit longer to clear the content.</div></div><hr />

People like you made this game retard friendly so the fail is on your side. 2, maybe 2 weeks from now and the instance will be cleared, including Algalon and then what?

I've got insider news for the next big content patch!!! Blizzard decided that releasing a new instance is not fun, since it's annoying and hard for most wow players to learn new encounters! So they'll keep ulduar and add the amazing number of 947 new items including a legendary for each class since it's unfair for the rest!!!<br />
<br />
However that's not all! Blizzard makes an amazing new refreshing and thoughtful move for the rest minor percentage of hardcore players : They'll add new real life-interacting achievements! A new program will be installed in your computers that will detect if a mouse or a keyboard etc is connected to your pc since the new kind of achievements will require to kill bosses without mouse or keyboard or both! furthermore another revolutionary new software will enable wow to detect through your webcam if you fight a boss blindfolded or not (blindfolded will be required by some new achievements!) <br />
<br />
That's not all! My inside source gave me some exclusive new info concerning the patch after that!!!!!!!!!<br />
Blizzard thinks that AQ40 was WAY too hard in vanilla wow and that very few people saw it. That's unacceptable since 98% of the wow community missed amazing fights like C'thun. So they plan ro revamp AQ40! 1649 new items with that and countless new achievements for the hardcores including an achievement that will require your whle guild to sing through teamspeak ''weeee are the chaaaampions'' while killing the last boss!!!<br />
<br />
These are just few of the new amazing changes coming with the new patches!<br />
<br />
p.s. They also decided to buff paladins in the upcoming patches cause the're admitedly too weak right now. So they'll increase thecooldown of all judgements to 40 sec, decrease the crit by 10% but they'll buff crusader strike by 2,37% and divine storm will heal for 1,79% more!</div></div><hr />

However, does it matter? It's not as though it's Alagon. It's not as though this isn't an incredibly buggy patch, which made it near impossible for some guilds to progress through. Server stability was horrid, etc...<br />

So, thus grats on your world first.<br />

Look at the blues. Ignis one shotting people with ease....though Blizz is looking at it....

<br />
Methinks, especially with problems like this on what are probably 2 of the 1st 3 bosses, means this patch needed more time of the PTR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just pray that Yogg-saron and Alagon are harder than the bosses doomed to be called &quot;Too easy&quot; until Icecrown Citadel comes out...<br />
<br />
<br />
Even though the guild has practiced all of the encounters thus far on PTR. Why shouldn't they be able to down them if they already know the fights and have great coordination--far more than the masses of scrub guilds that will be attempting Ulduar bosses for the next several months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
this is a true statement. Most of the guilds that have progressed far have definitely been doing these bosses on the PTR for a couple of months, thus calling it new is a not a true statement :o<br />
<br />
There are going to be tons of guilds in Ulduar, scrubs and all. There's also lots of good guilds in Ulduar that chose not to spend any time on the PTR and are behind the curve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Try to keep it in perspective. &quot;They&quot; are not you. If you and everyone else can also clear all the bosses in a raid cycle or three, then it might be too easy. However, if it takes competent guilds an average of 4 months to get kills on all 14 bosses and forever for scrub guilds, then the difficulty level is just fine. We might both know how to play football/soccer, but that doesn't mean we're gonna be trying out for Man United tomorrow.</div></div><hr />

I don't get the whole EU vs US debate. Did any of the people posting actually participate in those kills. I don't care if Americans or Eurpoeans are &quot;better&quot; at a computer game. Not to mention when they go down so quickly it doesn't seem like a good measure of skill. As for the going down quickly - these bosses were on PTR and blizzard has said the hard modes are for the hardcore so let's see how the hard modes play out or at least the bosses that haven't been on PTR. If the hardcore raiders had to work for a month raiding many hours a week for easy mode then casuals would be screwed.</div></div><hr />

Have any of you been paying attention to what Blizzard said about Ulduar and raiding in general? Normal mode is designed to be easy, they want people to see the content. What do you think they designed the whole Hard Mode concept for? <br />
<br />
Anyone who expected the top guilds to fail and get stuck on normal mode is delusional. You should reserve judgment until we see how the Hard Modes shape up, because that's where the challenge is supposed to be.<br />
<br />
I also wouldn't be surprised to see the top guilds get through the Hard Modes fast too, but guess what? It has always been that way, if it wasn't for the gate system Sunwell would have been cleared first reset too, yet looking back most everyone thinks it was perfectly tuned. <br />

The hard modes will be unlocked very quickly as long as they aren't gear dependent. Algalon won't take more than 3 days once he has been unlocked. Its a long time to a guild like Ensidia.<br />

Seriously, you people need to get out more. It saddens me to hear that people are wasting so much time and energy on something that has no lasting rewards. A true accomplishment would be creating original artwork, composing music, helping your community, or just spending time with your friends in real life.<br />
<br />
It's OK to spend an hour or two here and there on WoW, but this is just plain unhealthy.</div></div><hr />

If you want to save the world, go ahead you got plenty of chances, if you want to stay awake playing wow 22 hours a day, go ahead, if they have the time and the guts to do it, what's the problem?<br />
Sad thing is actually complaining about other's people fun.<br />

While im not contradicting what you stated; it amaze me that people, like you think spending your time &quot;outside&quot; is more everlasting and rewarding. When you dies and everyone you knew dies, you will be forgotten just like everyone, what you have accomplished will eventually disapear in the spiral of time.Everlasting rewards that you are refering too simply do not exist for mortals.</div></div><hr />

I never used the word &quot;everlasting&quot;. I described certain things as having more lasting rewards than WoW. Yes, nothing on this world is eternal, and you will eventually be completely forgotten; but you make a more lasting impression on your own and other people's lives by doing some of the things I mentioned, instead of sitting on a computer playing WoW all day.</div></div><hr />

EDIT: Quick, hashed out math. To snag the 7 minute achievement (which I'm assuming begins the moment you engage him), if there were NO adds, NO distractions, NO dialogue that slows the fight down and artificially lengthens it, a 25-man raid (including tanks and healers) would need everybody doing an average of 5.2k DPS to get close to 7 minutes.<br />
<br />
Obviously, this is in fact even higher, because healers can't be DPSing, and tanks will be lower. AND there are adds to deal with/visions to go through.<br />
<br />
Epic fight, pl0x.</div></div><hr />

if you open your mind a little bit,you will see that what they are doing out there makes them worthy of remembering:)<br />
<br />
ofc, they will never be recognized on national TV, but the wow community sure does recognize their effort, and since the community is what.. 12 mil ppl big? i wouldn't judge them so harsh. they have more ppl watching them and hearing about them then most artists out there in the world.<br />
<br />
you don't see the real them, nor do you know their names, but that is irrelevant. you see what they are doing. and what they are doing is the result of hard work that shouldn't be dismissed just because it involves &quot; playing a computer game&quot;. at least they are doing more that slacking in from of a television watching crappy TV all day like 65% of the worlds population does in their free time. those are the ppl that you should feel sorry for.<br />
<br />
these guys should be congratulated and admired for their efforts, not because they have the time to play it or cause they are &quot;wasting their lives&quot; playing wow, but because they found in WoW a way to excel and break out of mediocrity(which most people aren't even aware they are living in).</div></div><hr />

Fixed it.<br />
<br />
People are going to need to realize that - number one, these first kills mean diddly, as these are the BEST players in the entire game, after they've practiced on these bosses for a month.<br />
<br />
Second, the hard modes are what Blizz has marketed towards super-difficulty. They've said it a hundred times. Get used to it.</div></div><hr />

Getting 1 shotted by Ignis in his cock pot, not supposed to happen, but ....gasp...gasp....70k damage.... not just on one pull, but multiple pulls.<br />

<br />
Yes its great for whoever gets it, but its all quite farcial. Ensidia have been tearing through bosses when their realm has been up, and most likely would have gotten onto yogg-saron by now if not for the problems they had. They will lose this race simply because of the amount of time they were given compared to others. So it really doesn't matter who wins.<br />
<br />
Easy content + lag + disconnects + 1 day head start = USA world first.<br />
<br />
Not a nihilum fangirl, but its not fair on them or others trying for the world first and makes the race completely irrelevant. Whoever gets to the boss first and doesnt crash gets the world first.<br />
<br />
<br />
very true, however, a world first is still a world first. Just as winning a golf tournament is still a win even if Tiger Woods didn't enter. Not the guilds who have getting the world first's problem. Does it diminish the achievement....sure. But it's still a world first.</div></div><hr />

you miss the point, you need to lurk moar post less.<br />
people bring this up every single world first race.<br />
<br />
why do people care?<br />
<br />
well without getting into the subjective nature of this question ill make you a short list:<br />
1- novelty, just for the sake of knowing who felled the beast first.<br />
2-tradition, from when world firsts was srs bsns and the tactics and stratagems of the top guilds would be copied so others could actually do the content. <br />
3-competition, bragging rights for who is king of the content<br />
4-exploration, the thrill of running into an unknown fight, unknown by ANYONE. people like to watch and hear stories of how the encounters unfold and by following the races they too can at least experience something still reserved for hard core raiders the virgin encounter.<br />
<br />
so yea, its not a big deal. life does not hinge in the balance, and hardcore raiders are not peoples gods, but if you REALLY cant even imagine how someone would take interest in the world first unravel of a new chapter in wow then you sir lack anything even close to imagination.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the 3 servers I play on every guild that has tried to go in has ended up &quot;locked in&quot; to the instance and unable to get out or to attempt the bosses. This wasn't a few ... this was every single group that went into the instance for 6 hours last night once the servers finally came up and all day / night tonight. Very very frustrating to want to accomplish things and have to log onto an alt to even stay in game due to this massive glitch.<br />
<br />
Until the instance is available for all ... no one really knows who is &quot;king of content&quot;<br />
<br />
Its much easier to do that if you can actually go in the door and attempt.<br />
<br />
Tonight not even the old world dungeons were available ... much less the shiney new dungeon.<br />
<br />
One has to wonder if these &quot;star&quot; guilds servers are getting more attention from blizzard than the rest of us if they are not experiencing the same glitches.</div></div><hr />

you dont understand. ulduar is actually more than one instance in one. they clear all the bosses on NORMAL mode. and then we have all the hardmode bosses which is like a totally different instance on its own. and they are not close to the final boss. that would be algalon, the nightbane of ulduar :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
True. however achievements are something you do just once &quot;maybe a couple more times to help others&quot;. Hard modes on the other hands are the ways to get the better loot hence you will be doing them over and over again hence &quot;content&quot;. just because they have an achievement tac to them doesnt mean you only do it once.</div></div><hr />

i don't understand such a messages, i mean wtf, they made a game where everyone have a free choice...if you raid 2 days a week you choose easy mode and see the game (you pay money for it) if you raiding 7/7 you choose hard modes, see the game (you pay money for it), get better loot and running around dalaran shouting &quot;I got better violet pixels than you, casual jerk&quot;..<br />
<br />
The best thing of the Woltk is that the game became less addictive and you have a choice..receive welfare epics and waste less time on it, while your charachter looks nice ..or receive superdupermario epics and looks better but using more your free time for the game...<br />
<br />
whats wrong with the thing that people have choice?</div></div><hr />

Because to them, watching Average Joe have the same shot at 'looking like them' or 'experience the same' whilst they feel they 'are working so hard for these' is a concept that terrifies their feeble minds.<br />
<br />
It rhymes with 'caring' and it starts with an 's', and a whole lot more people should try doing it.<br />
<br />
Ulduar and WOTLK to a certain extent, like TBC, is nothing else then a learning experience to them in game design. It's called 'development'. And if this gives Blizzard <br />
(or other companies in the industry) valuable information on 'what to do' and 'what not to do' for future MMO games to come, it's win-win for the customer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason people did -not- clear entire instances in 1-2 weeks was because they were impossible to kill and nerfed later on. You did not have normal/hardmode, you did not have PTRs, you did not have 2-3 years of &quot;training&quot; behind you doing encounters.<br />
<br />
If you would create a pretbc server and put 40 people in blue gear there who cleared naxx40 and AQ40 before, they would race through the content at the same speed you see them clearing bosses now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild tested ulduar every time it was up on the ptr and here are a few facts:<br />
<br />
ALL the bosses that were EVER in ulduar on the PTR were *either* US or EU tested. E.g, EU never tested Ignis, US never tested razorscale, EU never tested hodir, US never tested Auriaya etc etc.<br />
<br />
So they didnt 'farm all the bosses for months/weeks'.<br />
<br />
Secondly of the bosses that were available blizzard NEVER put them up for more than two hours total. Frequently that two hours was cut in half by server/instance instability, half your raid getting locked into a loading screen etc.<br />
Other times blizz just booted everyone out without warning, one time we cleared to hodir were about to pull and...ghetto hearths everyone, instance not found.<br />
Some of those bosses were tested for 2 hours ever, most werent up for more than 2 sets of 2 hours.<br />
<br />
Farmed for weeks. Lol I dont think so.</div></div><hr />

... We don't want to push all warlocks, even in PvP, towards Destruction just to get these big hits or crits ...<br />
<br />
Some may argue that the fear nerf (although justified) was the main reson to push all the warlocks towards destruction... It may not be fun to have warlocks DOTing and then fearing everyone in sight until they die, but maybe demonology could be slightly more of a usefull arena spec. Would be nice to see some more work in that direction aswell. <br />
<br />
A spec that would go all the way down to Metamorphosis, which grants pretty good bonuses is still simply something that is in the shadow of affliction or destruction... Some see warlock's as a different path from fire mages or necromancers, which destruction and affliction are pretty close to. <br />
The demonic power that grants an ability to gain a shape and power of a demon is a trademark of demonology, and with the fear nerf, and destruction looking as the only real warlock path now, it would be really nice to see demonology gaining some glory. Right now it just has to many flaws and missing certain things to become a solid arena spec.</div></div><hr />
