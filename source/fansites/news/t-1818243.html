Blue Posts<br />
Contest Winners<br />
so, did anybody win?<br />
Yeah! 110 people to be exact! As well as the person (and guest) that won the trip to BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
We're still finalizing some of the winners. Per the rules they have 10 days to respond to our email before we pick a new winner. Of course some people don't check their email, we pick a new winner, and sometimes they also don't check their email, etc. etc. this could go on for a long time... Plus the legal process for some of the larger ticket prizes requires physical documents being mailed back and forth. Long story short, we don't have a full final list of winners yet--although it's only a few stragglers remaining.<br />
<br />
Instead of posting all the winner's screenshots (111 of them)--not only because it's a lot of entries to post, but also because it was a sweepstakes, and not a judgment of the best screenshots--we're going to just be posting some of our favorites. We should have that up early next week if I were to guess. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/380327-so-did-anybody-win/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300092424?page=1#6))<br />

&quot;Infernal soul&quot; might also be a term used by the legion for a fabricated &quot;soul,&quot; which may not be the same as a life soul. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/618157031883567108))<br />
<br />
So locks are controlling the infernal soul that animates the infernals? Neato, I guess fel-corrupted elemental spirits could also<br />
I would consider those more fel-corrupted living beings, not necessarily demonic, just corrupted. Aberrations. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/618157277728608256))<br />

...aren't shaman heals just water spells?<br />
They used to be life spells! Now they are water. I think their res is still nature? I don't recall. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/618457224076070912))<br />

Pets and Pet Battles<br />
About battle pets, ever considered that the system might be getting a bit bloated? There are 14 rats, for example.<br />
Sounds like we need more cats (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/618497907453329408))<br />

What would the top guilds do? run a mythic run all over again for getting the best possible gear for certain specs that are of top performance in Archimonde fight?<br />

<br />
I'm thinking less super hard, more most guilds haven't met the mythic gear check yet to survive the fight. I'm guessing the scaled up damage for Archimonde is too much for largely heroic slanted geared players (considering they've run it at least three times now) with a few spread out Mythic slanted pieces (remember bosses in the raid have gear with ascending ilvls and stats as you progress). Also Method had that problem with actually being unable to zone into the raid without being kicked out for a few days and there has apparently been tweets of attempts getting down to 2% but not being able to survive it.</div></div><hr />

I dunno...call me crazy but having super mythic heroic beefed up bosses isn't what makes the game fun.<br />

Really disagree, mainly cause i like being better then other people and a game like vanilla was wouldnt allow that currently and the fights would be boring as hell (i.e sit at boss and spam 1 ability for 10 minutes without moving).</div></div><hr />

So go play a game like Wildstar? What the heck are you doing in WoW?<br />
<br />
For me the raiding sweet spot was Vashj/Kael/Archie/Illidan. Those fights were interesting, challenging, required teamwork and you didn't have to spend the whole time watching tell me when or weak auras in order to preform your roll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Starfall still hits everything under the sun. At one point I believe they did make it so it only hit what you Moonfired, but let's face it, that's not terribly fun.<br />
<br />
The thing is sometimes you really want this sort of behavior.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because it was the best it failed so hard... surely :rolleyes:<br />

What the fuck is wrong with you? It had the best dungeons but the rest of the game was a pile of shit, how hard is that to understand? Seriously.</div></div><hr />

Where is the logic in this community.<br />
<br />
This is so dumb, because every single MMO can be described as a horrible fuck up of an MMO. And for you that that means no one can be happy someone they like getting a blizzards job?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly that! more mechanics dont make a fight harder, they make it JUST SLOWER TO LEARN IT.<br />
I don't know, i haven't thought of a fight that would be tough not because it has 5 phases that you have to master step by step and also not being sheer numbers of damage taken and required to do to make it through.<br />
<br />
What i am trying to say is, for players who are semi-hardcore and down to casual (= 90% of the guilds ?) like i was, it was really annoying making it to the last 2-3 bosses on every raid content and finding a tough raid boss that would required you 5 phases to wipe and learn each one till you master them all and make it good on transition phases between. I would prefer a Siegecrafter blackfuse over a 10phases last boss, although i have to admit Garrosh Mythic (ex-heroic) was super fun and hard but ok easier with a monk tank :P</div></div><hr />

It's still going. And I play it from time to time. If it had sunk that badly, the game would have been shutdown. But it's not. It's doing what SWTOR did and SWTOR is still going strong. So.<br />
<br />
Honestly, right now, if I had to pick a sicking ship of crap right now, it'd BE WoW. Especially since I'm seriously thinking of quitting after HFC is finally released to us casuals and taking up FFXIV and Wildstar completely until the next Blizzcon. And even then, I won't resub for WoW until the next expac has been thoroughly looked over.</div></div><hr />

Oh yes it is. It's still being played and the like. That is not a sunk or failed game. Especially if people liked the dungeon content. The only thing I hated about that game was the raid atunement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it sunk tremendously. That's not open to question. Where you go off the rails is thinking that that would have meant the game would have been shut down. But shutting down a game means that ongoing costs (not sunk costs) aren't being recouped. A game can fail miserably to earn a return on its initial investment and still be worth continuing to operate.</div></div><hr />

Given the player count &quot;evolution&quot;, Wildstar is a massive failure from a business point of view. End of story.<br />

You can disagree on the content of the game, and that is your choice. From a business point of view however, it was an absolute failure that brought much less money than anticipated. If you had a car that only sold a few thousand units and forced its maker to subsist on spare parts sales before finally shutting down, it is called a business failure. Even if the car is awesome looking (like the DeLorean on which this example is based :p )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those are the features I loved about wildstar. The solo content was great:<br />
1. Fun over the top story<br />
2. AOE effects that you could clearly see and react too.<br />
3. No mob or player targeting, all combat skill (including healing) are AOE based.<br />
4. No tapping. Get credit for a quest or drop percentage based on the amount of damage you or your group did.<br />
5. Fun challenges you could do for some minor bonuses.<br />
6. Very customizable housing system.<br />
7. More flexable AH<br />
<br />
That being said, the game mainly suffered from:<br />
1. Lack of player base. Getting past the inertia of WoW is hard<br />
2. Unnecessary complex craft system.<br />
3. Not much end game solo content.<br />
4. Hard to get into end game group content.<br />
<br />
I'm really hoping that some of the direction that wildstar was going will be carried over into WoW. It probably will be given Blizzard stragety of &quot;don't invent, take something that is good and make it better&quot;.<br />
<br />
Wildstar is Free to play now (I think it is). It has a great leveling experience. If you have free time, I'd go ahead and try it out.</div></div><hr />

Then maybe - you know - devs should stop making WoW clones and see them fail? Maybe they should create something different? Crazy idea, I know. Because that would require them to - ugh - use brains. <br />
<br />
<br />
2. Unnecessary complex craft system.<br />
Yeah, actually, I'm all for complicating the crafting system in WoW as well (but with increased rewards). Professions really got butchered a bit too much in this last couple of expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Not much end game solo content.<br />
4. Hard to get into end game group content.<br />
What would you expect from devs who worked on vanilla WoW and BC? :p<br />
<br />

<br />

Assuming there is something to take from. This being said, I think WoW could indeed use some ideas from other MMOs, not sure if Wildstar is among those, though.</div></div><hr />

You're entitled to your own opinion sure, but what made Vanilla &quot;better&quot;?<br />
<br />
Terrible class design and balance.<br />
<br />
Terrible itemization.<br />
<br />
Raid content that wasn't accessible to many players.<br />
<br />
Etc.<br />
<br />
That's how I remember Vanilla.<br />
<br />
Sure, maybe more of your friends played in earlier iterations of the game, or that &quot;new car smell&quot; still lingered. Nostalgia aside, you'd be hard-pressed to say that Vanilla was better as far as gameplay goes.</div></div><hr />

WildStar did have some great dungeon and raid content, sure, but part of this design was a resurgence of old-school ideals: lengthy attunements, laborious crafting, daily and dull grinding, and 40-man raid sizes.<br />
<br />
WoW is well beyond the point where any of these are healthy for the game, if they wish to keep a fair subscriber count. WildStar's downfall proves that very few people actually want the &quot;hardcore MMO&quot; gameplay of yore, and even the &quot;good&quot; content within it was not enough to keep people playing.<br />

Amen. I'm sorry, but nostalgia is a powerful force... if only we could tap it to run something other than our imaginations.<br />

It was fun because it was new. Do we really want to go back to a time when tier pieces were for 1 role only... paladins were only debuffers, warriors were only tanks, etc...</div></div><hr />
