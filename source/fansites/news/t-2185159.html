Mythic+ Feedback<br />
Thanks for copying this over! Good feedback here that I can send on up. I think the point on differences in difficulties between affixes is particularly relevant. Seems a relevant conversation the dev team would be happy to listen to is everyone's thoughts on how you deal with the various affixes (ignore them, smaller pulls, etc), and how those experiences have evolved so far in Legion.<br />
<br />
I would also be interested in how you guys rank the affixes in order of difficulty to deal with (this obviously changes as the rank increases, but lets look at say... 5 which is pretty average) in the current environment on live.<br />
<br />
I'm also very aware of the differences between dungeons on Mythic+, and Ion has previously touched on the preference for Maw of Souls. I'm not exactly sure what can be done at the moment about the gaps the community sees between them, but I'm willing to take any feedback you guys want to share.<br />
<br />
My biggest gripe with Mythic+ are the timers. Timers are the reason I didn't like CMs, and it's the reason I really dislike Mythic+ despite loving the concept.<br />
I've seen this point of discussion too, and it's come up numerous times in my own feedback and reporting. Just wanted to say I know this is a valid opinion that I'm definitely aware of. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753407148?page=3#43))<br />

Vengeance Demon Hunter Feedback<br />
Thank you for the suggestions and discussion.<br />
<br />
In today’s 7.2 PTR update, we’re testing the following change:<br />
<br />
<br />
Demonic Wards now reduces all damage taken by 20% (was 10%), and increases Armor by 75% (was 120%).<br />
<br />
What this amounts to is a passive reduction of all incoming damage, combined with a lowered defenses against physical damage, leaving almost no change to incoming physical, but a substantial new mitigation against magic.<br />
<br />
Your feedback has been very helpful, so again, thank you! (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753506032?page=1#12))<br />

Protection Warrior Feedback<br />
As before, we thank you for the good feedback.<br />
<br />
The Nighthold has put a spotlight on magic mitigation more than previous raids, and we’ve seen how that resulted in Protection Warriors (who are typically a very well-rounded tank spec) falling a bit behind other tanks as a result.<br />
<br />
Today’s new 7.2 PTR build includes the following change:<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
<br />
Gleaming Scales (Artifact Trait) increases Spell Reflection magical damage reduction by 20%.<br />
<br />
Gleaming Scales is a new Artifact Trait that’s coming in 7.2, and the intention here is to provide Warriors with a way to keep up with incoming spells in encounters that are magic-heavy, such as Spell Augur Etraeus or Krosus in The Nighthold. <br />
<br />
We’re also testing a new change to the Protection Legendary belt Thundergod’s Vigor that triples the rate at which your Thunder Claps reduce the cooldown on Demoralizing Shout.<br />
<br />
We continue to analyze and consider everything you’re telling us here (and elsewhere!), so keep it coming. Thank you! (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753515694?page=10#187))<br />

Just going off what they said at blizzcon, that raids weren't connected to patches and that they wanted a raid to last 4-5 months, been under 3 for NH, may/june would be likely, probably with 7.2.5.</div></div><hr />

As long as there is a plethora of other content to do beside the raid then I'm fine with this. Otherwise it's not the kind of pacing I was hoping for and they should have just waited imo.</div></div><hr />

For the patch: I'd say around VERY EARLY april (As in, the 1st, through 3rd).<br />

Well, if you don't raid there really hasn't been a decent change in pace since 7.1 in nov. 7.2 is the first major patch since then and does come with quite a few changes to dungeons and world events. I wouldn't say a plethora... yet, because I really haven't look over what it all entails besides the pertinent things to me like the new AP stuff and WQs, but I know there was a pet battle dungeon and more, guess what it includes really depends on what you like :S</div></div><hr />

Lol, tomb won't be released in april. Out of around 2000 active raiding mythic guilds, 47 have killed gul'dan (I say active based off who is 4/10, its probably closer to 4000), NH is far from over, there's still something like 3000 heroic guilds still working on heroic Gul'dan and countless still working their way through. April would be far too soon.</div></div><hr />

Your PATCH release date MAY be correct, but the raid will definitely NOT come before late june. Personally, I'd prefer the Raid to open in September (after summer vacation with 7.2.5, which also is exactly 1 year after expansion release) with a ToV-like Raid in June/July (patched in as 7.2.3 for example). Remember, if the Raid comes too soon, we'll be seeing a 10+month last tier AGAIN!</div></div><hr />

Patch is coming out next week or the week after, it won't be in April. <br />
<br />
They'll probably mention the date at the Q&amp;A tomorrow and the next PTR build will be release.<br />
<br />
Also if you had the ability to read, you would have read that the raid will require a similar quest chain length like insurrection did, so the raid won't open up for at least 9 weeks after 7.2 hits live. They mentioned this only 5 times in the past 6 months.</div></div><hr />

Not only will ALOT of people quit due to them thinking as if there's a drought on the loose, but what if I'm not a mythic raider, eh? I can only do Heroic NH, and even that's putting a stretch into things. I'm better off having 4 Months Of NH, than having 6 months of it....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Q: Raid testing already? Only a handful of guilds have even finished Mythic Nighthold! Are you out of your damn minds?<br />
<br />
A: We realize this is coming right on the heels of plenty of raid content on the live servers, and that competitive guilds feel like they need to get every bit of exposure to upcoming content in order to be properly prepared. It's not ideal timing, but it's a consequence of the way we're structuring our content releases, and something we're looking for ways to improve and continue to refine over the course of Legion. As we've said in the past, Tomb of Sargeras will not be available right when 7.2 unlocks, and a quest arc (akin to the 7.1 Suramar Insurrection campaign) will lead up to its opening. We certainly do not want to rush players through content faster than they can enjoy it - Nighthold is going to be the premiere raid for some time to come.<br />
<br />
But Tomb of Sargeras, at least as far as art assets, and most descriptive text, voice overs, and so forth goes, needs to be in patch 7.2 data. That means we need to begin testing it far earlier, relative to the date when the raid will actually go live, than we have in past expansions. <br />
<br />
Also: <br />

Q: @WarcraftDevs yeah but how &quot;soon&quot; is 7.2 I'm hearing so many rumors flying around and with AOTC on the line it matters a LOT.<br />
A: The availability of Ahead Of The Curve achievements is tied to raid release, not patch release.</div></div><hr />

You must be new. Why would they release a patch on A WEEKEND? Why on Earth would they release a raid on a Thursday or Friday?<br />
<br />
If you're going to take a guess, at least make it an educated guess. Patches are released with maintenance, not just some willy nilly days pulled from a hat.<br />

7.2 being on the back ground downloader means it'll be out within the next 2-3 weeks.<br />
<br />
Exactly. This means all the main content is in there and now they are down to the last couple of tuning passes. It'll be either the 28th or the 4th unless a major bug is found between now and then.</div></div><hr />

hell there is still the slight possability it could come on the 21st, allthough it is looking unlikley, we will know by tomorow cause tyomorow will be the lastest (in comparison when it launched) to a patch they have announced, so its unlikley<br />

Yeah 100%, 21st would be nice but yeah we'd need to get notice soon. Any later than the 29th and I really believe something would have gone wrong. 3 weeks after starting the background download would just seem too long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can someone not understand putting a timer on something doesn't make it more enjoyable all of a sudden? (see what I did there?)<br />
Do Raids have a set timer in which you have to complete them ? <br />
The reason some people dislike the timer aspect is since they prefer content which they want to progress on and figure out strats/tactics to beat them progressively. Not to be punished by a timer which tells you &quot;you failed&quot;. Now it's basically a rush against time and to whoever has the most AoE/DPS to beat the timer, and not about who can come up with strats and ways to beat the Dungeon itself.<br />
Want me to go more in depth as to why a different point of view might give you some more insight ? Calling others wrong just because they have a different opinion on something (you can't be wrong on something there is no clear science on to prove who's wrong) is also wrong.<br />
See what I did there ?<br />

Holy dumb.<br />
<br />
It's.called.an.enrage.timer. That's literally the point of the built-in timer that has been around since, I dunno, forever? &quot;Who can come up with strats&quot; please, you must be joking. Wow isn't rocket science, you're not going to make some autistic breakthrough regarding how to more effectively down a boss with the entire raid exclusively using &quot;flash heal&quot;.<br />
<br />
Doing substantial DPS while avoiding mechanics and strategic pulls has always been the difficult part of competitive PVE.<br />
<br />
I typically don't lash out like this but when I see such glaring mistakes from people who want to lower the difficulty of the game, I can't help myself. The idiotic platituded at the end ( duhhhh me hav diff opinon dsnt meenn im wrong!!), is the cherry on top.</div></div><hr />
