WoW Classic - Hunter Beta Issues Update<br />
Since the beginning of beta, we’ve seen a lot of bug reports around the Hunter class in particular, and we’ve been working diligently over the past weeks to shore up some of the issues that players have been reporting to us. We felt that it would be helpful to post an update on our progress as well as to clear up some confusion around issues that were reported that are behaving consistently with the Reference client and are not considered to be actual bugs.<br />
<br />
The following issues are behaving as expected and are considered to be “Not a Bug” (we’ll be updating the Not A Bug list with these issues as well):<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunter “dead zone” is working as expected and is consistent with the Reference Client<br />
A wolf pet’s Howl buff is consumed by anything that causes damage, even if it does not benefit from the buff<br />
A Hunter pet’s Bite and Claw ability damage will not change in the tooltip based on the happiness of the pet. The tooltip will always display the damage as if the pet were Content (yellow). This is consistent with the Reference client<br />
<br />
Note: This was reported several times to us based on 1.2 patch notes which seem to have been misunderstood. The intent here is simply that damage displayed is what the pet would deal if it were Content, not what it deals based on its current happiness level.<br />
<br />
Traps can sometimes not be triggered if a player moves over them very quickly (i.e. a Warrior’s Charge ability). This behavior is consistent with the Reference client.<br />
Auto Shot does not make a sound when cast during the animation of Hunter’s Mark and certain other abilities<br />
Scatter Shot and Freezing Trap share diminishing returns<br />
<br />
<br />
The following reported issues are either confirmed fixed in recent builds, or we have upcoming fixes currently in testing:<br />
<br />
<br />
Crocolisk pets cause noticeable server lag when summoned<br />
Beast lore does not display the targeted creatures armor in the tooltip<br />
Feign death does not immediately drop the Hunter from combat in a Battleground<br />
Feign Death does not cause the Hunter’s health and mana bar to zero out as if the Hunter was dead<br />
Feign Death does not kill the hunter if they stay feigned the entire duration<br />
Hunters are performing a WalkBackwards animation while strafing left during Auto Shot<br />
Hunters have the ability to tame pets 2 levels higher than the Hunter’s level<br />
Hunter Pets do not auto-cast Dash or Dive when engaging their target<br />
The Bonus Armor from Thick Hide is dropping off of Hunter pets shortly after talenting into it<br />
Sending Hunter pets into combat with a special ability such as Bite does not also trigger your pet to begin attacking<br />
Multiple instances of Hunter’s Mark can be applied to a target<br />
Hunters are unable to cancel the animation associated with placing a trap by moving<br />
Explosive Trap and Frost Trap place the hunter into combat each time they apply their associated effects or deal damage<br />
Enemies will ignore collision when in combat with a player<br />
<br />
Note: This isn’t hunter specific and was a global issue. This did affect Hunter pets so we listed it here<br />
<br />
Pets do not display a “ding” visual when leveling up<br />
Activating a Night Elf Hunter’s Shadowmeld racial ability at the same time that the Eyes of the Beast cast completes will give the player control over pet movement without snapping to the Pet’s point of view<br />
Ranged attacks cannot be blocked<br />
Training pets may cause your client to become unresponsive<br />
The spell animation for flare is significantly different than the animation used in 1.12<br />
<br />
<br />
Please note that this list is not comprehensive. There have been many other issues that affect hunters that have been fixed recently, and we are still hard at work fixing other bugs.<br />
<br />
The following issues have been confirmed as bugs and are still Known Issues as of our current Beta build:<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunter pets that died while the hunter was in a battleground are resurrected in an unhappy state when the battleground ends<br />
Auto Shot does not animate or display a missile when it fires immediately after Aimed Shot<br />
Aspect of the Pack will sometimes attempt to apply itself to mounted party members<br />
When a Quiver or Ammo Pouch is equipped, the tooltip for Aimed Shot incorrectly reflects an attack speed bonus from the Quiver or Ammo Pouch that it does not actually receive<br />
When taming a pet that teaches the Hunter a new Beast Training ability, the chat message does not report the ability’s rank<br />
The Hunter’s quiver may occasionally appear in the Hunter’s hand instead of the Hunter’s equipped weapon<br />
<br />
<br />
We hope to have fixes in place for these issues before launch, but please note that we can never guarantee when or if any known issue will be fixed.<br />
Thank you all for your reports on the WoW Classic Beta so far!</div></div><hr />

And to people that are so scared of playing a Hunter in Classic now because of this list.. Your loss.<br />
<br />
Sure, Hunters dont top the DPS meters in Naxxramas but in early raids they are really strong. They are still needed in Naxxramas too for kiting and curing enrages.<br />
<br />
In literally every single other aspect of the game outside of the cutting edge endgame raiding, they are probably the strongest of them all. Kings of leveling. Kings of gold farming. Kings of duels. Kings of World PvP. <br />
<br />
What a weak and unfinished class, huh?</div></div><hr />

I want to make a meme for this. Picture a daughter with her ill-suited boyfriend in front of her dad. <br />

Dad with the face changed out for Blizzard's Classic Bug List and them saying &quot;You think you do but you don't&quot;<br />

Daughter yells &quot;But Daddy I love him!&quot;</div></div><hr />

That must be one of the oddest and most specific bugs I've ever seen.<br />
Although for quite some time during BfA, just having a pet out, any pet, caused many to experience regular (as clockwork) fps drops so I suppose different time, just as odd bugs. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah this. And hunters are also really fun to play in classic... unlike hunters in BfA<br />
<br />
Single Target<br />
Single target rotations for Hunters aren't too complex. They revolve around maximizing your pet damage, while not putting it in too much danger, while you are using the abilities Aimed Shot and Multi-Shot. Other than those abilities, you are almost always just auto attacking. One important thing to note is that Hunters always use slow ranged weapons because of Aimed Shot.<br />
It is important for Hunters to not &quot;clip&quot; their auto attacks. What this means is that if you are about to shoot an auto attack in 1 second, but start a 3 second cast of Aimed Shot, you are losing out on that auto attack because Hunters cannot fire auto attacks while casting. To work around this Hunters look for weapons that have 3.0 attack speed or slower (such as Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting). If Aimed Shot is available, the Hunter will wait for an auto shot to go off, then start casting Aimed Shot so that they do not miss out on any auto attacks.<br />
<br />
Multi Target<br />
Aside from Multi-Shot, which is already in the Hunter's normal rotation, AoE damage can come from preemptively setting up traps, like Immolation Trap. Moreover, if the mobs are not dying extremely quickly, and if your raid leader allows it, a hunter can tab-target and multi dot with serpent sting (although there are limited debuff slots, so make sure it is alright with your team first). Lastly, Hunters have the ability Volley, but it's damage output is quite low. So, this ability is typically best used only if there is a large density of enemies stacked up.<br />
<br />

So compelling, such design. I'll take BfA, thanks, although MoP was the best iteration of the class so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then take it, but I still think that hunters were super fun to play in vanilla. Yes the gameplay was simple, but that doesn't mean at all that the spec is boring or bad.<br />
<br />
BfA MM has quite a lot of buttons to press and the spec is extremely boring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well as someone having spent considerable time with the class on a certain shall-not-be-named server, I was bored out of my mind in any form of content which required playing for performance.<br />
<br />
And current MM is boring as hell not due to button count, but because BFA MM is just a few steps away from being a Classic spec in terms of design. At least that's my opinion. It does gain some favor from certain azerite traits though.</div></div><hr />

It's a bug introduced in 1.12. Classic is going to be a copy of 1.12 w/ most of its bugs.</div></div><hr />

I played hunter for a little while at the beginning of Wrath but that was my only experience with it. I remember fighting Malygos and having to actually manage the dead zone in a raiding situation for the first time ever and wondering why the game never put you in situations where it mattered before that. Class specific weaknesses are such an interesting design tool that never gets used anymore. Filling up my tiny bags with arrows and pet food also sounds pretty amazing. What is even the point of having bags in a game where inventory management isn't supposed to be part of the gameplay?</div></div><hr />

As a hunter said back in the days on the forums:<br />
&quot;Today I wanted to shoot myself, so I put the gun against my head and pulled the trigger, but I got an error message 'Sorry, that target is too close.'&quot;. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Difficult to weed out what's genuine and just part of the usual &quot;current WoW sucks&quot;-brigade. People enjoying their class are less likely to speak out. <br />
<br />
Also so few actually manage to perform at any level with their main, nevermind every class. <br />
As barebones as some specs have become, they could be worse as seen from history. Ion's recent appearance on class design gives hope though. ^_^</div></div><hr />

DR's were in Vanilla, not at the start though i believe (i think DRs started to be added in 1.3 or something) and i also don't think every CC's had DR's. They changed it quite ofter over the course of Vanilla.</div></div><hr />
