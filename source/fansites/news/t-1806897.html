Patch 6.2 - Trait Replacement Selection<br />
It seems that the patch changed how the items like Supreme Manual of Dance (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118474-supreme-manual-of-dance) work, allowing you to select the trait being replaced. The reroll items still work the same way.<br />

Garrison Gold Nerf<br />
There is a reduction in gold with alts, but running missions with additional characters (alts) will still have a benefit over just using one. Two characters will still make more gold than one character will, and three will still make more than two, etc. There's a diminishing return sure, but you're still making more.<br />
<br />
This is where I get confused. Because the point was supposed to be to make it so that we didn't feel the need to run alts to maximize income. This system ensures we do exactly that because now my main (the only one who is taking her garrison seriously) is making less gold without alts.<br />
Well, you always made less gold if you didn't do missions with alts. You make more gold doing missions with multiple characters. That is still true.<br />
<br />
But, taking a step back, are you saying you have no ability to earn an income to cover your main character's repair costs, etc. unless you run Garrison missions on multiple alts and funnel that into your main? I'd be interested to know more about your play habits, and also what income sources you used before Garrisons existed. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/378095-i-deleted-my-alts/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18194753402?page=5#88))<br />

Player Feedback<br />
Then you wonder why blizzard doesn't listen to you?<br />
Wait wait wait, I thought we caved to complaints too much!? We can't both ignore all complaints from our castle on top of Mount Wedeci'dewutsphun, AND also cave in to all complaints. Can we? <br />
Maybe the truth is somewhere in between, and that we value constructive feedback, and can admit mistakes, and grow from them, and that we value and enjoy the ability to create entertainment, and honestly striving to make a fun and positive gaming experience.<br />
<br />
Any patch day is certain to have a lot of hotfixes being made based on feedback, aaaaand also probably a lot of nonconstructive posts too I guess. We can try to moderate more of those.

Druid talent &quot;Wild Charge&quot; no longer works onto wild mushrooms in battlegrounds. Intended?<br />

Top comments on reddit about Q&amp;A followup disagree with you on enh and elemental.Why do you feel the class doesntneed a rework?<br />

<br />
Character / Items<br />
can we still get the Garrosh Heirlooms? Do we have to be on specific classes for specific ones?<br />
No, these were limited-time rewards. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/610973480180416513))<br />
<br />
Are the current PvP sets for Conquest and Honor going to be obtainable in 6.2 like in the past?<br />
Yes! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/610974046948327424))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
What would you consider a minimum ilvl for Normal HFC? Not expecting to be locked out, trying to set expectations w/ team<br />
Target would be people who did at least some (but not necessarily lots of) Normal Foundry, or who have equivalent gear. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611303082568327171))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Would Ranked SoloQ in arena be reality in the future, really think i could do a lot for the PvP-Players :-)<br />
We'll discuss it but we have concerns. Specifically, toxicity and a lack of gameplay differentiation from unranked solo queue. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611258515512930306))<br />
<br />
What is the main purpose of the MMR system for PvP that got introduced in 6.1 - I barely see any benefits from it<br />
There was no change to MMR. The change was to a system that boosts your Current Rating (CR) which used to increase at a... (1) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611290021333716992))<br />
...higher rate until it was within 200 points of your MMR. This was heavily abused by boosters. (2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611290103323955201))<br />

Will the chance of getting Felblight from gathering nodes be based on skill?<br />
No, it will not. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/611289768568078336))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
I know it's probably early to say this, but I think a lot of people would be sad if we didn't get a new race/class next xpac<br />
Or what about a class that IS a race??? What would that even be? Like race: Ogre, class: Ogre, spec: Ogre. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/611673164406325248))<br />

Mhm, think i made 1k less gold yesterday than normal. Its not that big of a deal, nor has it ever been a good idea in wow to put all your fish in one barrel when it comes to gold making.

<br />
Melodramatic, perhaps, but it's not because garrison missions give less gold, it's because the ones that do give gold now appear more spread out (and in some recorded cases, for the unlucky, most/all appear on those with underdeveloped alts whose garrisons can't even complete them). An over the top reaction, but it's the only known viable way of making sure the gold giving missions (which, again, do not give less gold individually - the amount of missions that would appear on a single character now appear to be spread out over how ever many characters you have in garrisons) all appear on a character that can be guaranteed to finish them...<br />
<br />
Unless you put in the time to make sure your alts are also capable of finishing them, with upgraded followers, at the very least.<br />
<br />
Remember how Blizz said part of why they were making the change was to make playing alts as part of supporting the main character feel less necessary? Yeah, the change is making players feel like they have to do the exact opposite - put more time into alts - to get a similar net effect, and that's what Bliz was being called out on it...<br />
<br />
What really got the drama flowing, though, was how tone deaf the blue response is to what was actually being asked and discussed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? I mean, aside from the new questing zone which is well-done (which I should note was supposed to be included WITH launch, but they delayed it 2 patches), I have nothing really new to do in the game. AND, my army of alts have been gimped. I NEVER have been an alt guy in Warcraft. I only ever leveled alts to the minimum level required to max a profession, but then WoD came along and ruined even the already archaic alt-hopping system that existed for professions, and I sucked it up and leveled all my alts to 100, painfully, over the last 6 months (now have 8 lvl 100s). 6.2 now nerfs the 25k gold investment I dropped into each of my alts garrisons... Blizz's only blue response is &quot;Ya, it's nerf'd how much gold you make on alts, but hey, it's technically more!&quot; Ya, maybe 2 or 3 alts it &quot;might&quot; be worth to bother with garrison misison, but after that it's worthless. I am sorry, but that's your fault blizzard, you pushed us players to spend money into this garrison gold sink and then you kill any advantage to having it. This is messed up and I am pissed. WoD already has had the worst end-game of any expansion to date (awesome leveling, great raids, but overall terrible end-game stuff to do) and now you do one more thing to kill it and punish the player.<br />
<br />
Seriously, they talked so much about how awesome the 6.2 garrison shipyard was gonna be. Seriously, outside of the gold it gives me, it's freakin useless and boring. It's just a MENU game and not fun at all. Maybe if I was actually going out on some sweet naval battles out on the ocean myself, I'd think the expansion was cooler. For all it matters to me, all Blizzard has to do is say a follower mission is to kill laser sharks in space, because all it is is a txt description of what is going on. Who cares!? It's boring, and this was a major feature of the new patch.<br />
<br />
Anyway... just venting, but man does this game really blow now. A week ago I decided to just liquidate all of my assets and convert them into game time tokens. I don't even feel a deep incentive to finish any of the new 6.2 content. I was hoping to be surprised and end up liking it, but nope, it's really over for me now. I'll come back maybe next expansion if the game looks any better, with a bag full of game time saved, until then eff this. My subscription expires on the 27th.</div></div><hr />

OK its nothing amazing or surprising but why did anyone expect to to be? We got some new stuff to do outside of our garrison! Sure it will probably last a month at best but we know that WoD has suffered from lack of dev time / commitment and weak lore. Its a 10 year old game! What do we really expect to change that will surprise us now? Story improvement will have to wait for next expansion as will massive PvP balance and profession changes so we are stuck with it....period.<br />
I'm not fanboy WoW but in all seriousness you either want to play the game or you don't...if its the latter don't be on the WoW forums moaning, go enjoy something!</div></div><hr />

Some people are just beyond saving.<br />
<br />
Some people don't care about alts. They were clearly just tools that were discarded by this person when Blizzard changed the system in place. I think it's more melodramatic to claim a person is beyond &quot;saving&quot; for deleting alts they didn't need anymore... as if their life is now doomed or something for that decision.</div></div><hr />

You sure sound like one, There's a lot of people who spew out crap like &quot;It's a 10 year old game!&quot; when in fact it's far from it, with the numerous expansions, patches and behind the scenes updates it's drasticly different than WoW was 10 years ago, not to mention the fact that we're not playing 10 year old content, we're playing an expansion. <br />
<br />
And if you think that all these problems will be magically fixed in the next expac.. that's wishful thinking at it's best.</div></div><hr />

I fully admit I leveled a bunch of alts to max and handled all the garrisons for them and built up a solid follower group on each of them so I could use them to earn gold. So it is a tad annoying that all that work doesn't pay off, especially if the big gold missions only happen once between the whole account now.<br />
<br />
And if I decide I wanted to be on another server... well... Damn.</div></div><hr />

They're beyond saving from themselves. It doesn't hurt ME if they want to delete characters they've spent time on and they're sure acting as if said alts were more than just &quot;tools to be discarded&quot; when they make it sound as if Blizzard killed the characters for them.</div></div><hr />

ogrila.org has been supporting the idea of playable Ogres since back before Vanilla even left beta.</div></div><hr />

Other things than Tanaan keeps me uninterested. Mostly the class balance changes /issues that are even worst than 6.1... <br />
I don't give a damn about shipyard... it's &quot;garisson&quot; all over again...i'm not into it.<br />
I'm not here to whine. Just stating reasons... the alpha and omega reason is class balance. It's not going anywhere as PvP goes...and i won't pay sub to play half or 1/3 of a game or just to play specific FOTM classes...<br />
And that's that. I hope they learn something... and the only thing that can make them think a bit further are sells/money... Whining won't get us anywhere. the only thing someone can do is cut the damn sub and do something else and if they actually fix things out give them a chance (because some of us actually love the game)...</div></div><hr />

But that's no reason to un-sub the game if you like Blizzard and like Warcraft for the game it's always been. No matter how bad the content may be, how boring, or how outdated-feeling or repetitious you deem it, you should never cancel the sub. If you did, you would simply ruin the fun for all those that are enjoying the game because they'll cut back on designers and developers, lay off customer service (GMs), and QA won't hire anyone else to insure the game functions as we expect it to. There's not a single valid reason for anyone who is playing this game to ever cancel their sub, just continue paying and come back later so we can keep the game going with vibrant new content and attract new players.<br />
<br />
Take it for what it is, a game you enjoy and support.</div></div><hr />

I would love it so much and it will make up for the awfulness that is WoD. Well for some reasons.</div></div><hr />
