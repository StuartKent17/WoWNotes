<meta name="description" content="Tier 8 Sets Stats Update 
In the latest a lot of changes were made to the stat points distribution on plate sets, most of the time to add more strength at the expense of other stats. A few things were fixed on other sets (bonuses mostly) and I guess it's a good time for a recap! If you want to compare you can still check the old tier 8 stats post

Testing Cross-Language Battlegroups<br />
As previously announced, we are working on implementing Cross-Language Battlegroups (CLBG) to increase the size of most Battlegroups. You can find the original announcement here: http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=6425923570 (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=6425923570)<br />
<br />
The CLBG is currently open for testing on the PTRs, allowing players from the different PTRs to meet each other in the Battlegrounds and Arenas. This weekend we will be doing some focused testing of the Battlegrounds, and we will appreciate if you participate during this time:<br />
<br />
On Saturday 28th of March, focused Battleground testing will take place between 18:00 and 20:00 CET<br />
On Sunday 29th of March, focused Battleground testing will take place between 16:00 and 20:00 CEST (remember to adjust the clock!)<br />
<br />
We will be thankful for your feedback about any bugs and issues encountered during the focused testing, and we will be especially interested in hearing if players from another PTR join a Battleground on the same side as you.<br />
<br />
Please keep this thread to test reports, and take general discussion of the feature in this other thread: http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=8136835748 (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=8136835748)</div></div><hr />

Actually it pretty much sucks. The last thing most tanks wanted was yet another shield (like the priest shield) that absorbed damage so that the healer didn't have to heal them. Warriors and druids might be ok with it because I think they changed the way rage generation worked but as a paladin I don't want damage to be absorbed, I want the healers to be healing me for the damage taken with no absorption. Every time I have damage absorbed instead of healed I'm losing out on mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
To bad Blizzard is to clueless to figure out that elemental shamans and holy paladins fight over the exact same gear. Be nice if they went back and removed useless mp5 from holy gear and replaced it with haste and crit.</div></div><hr />

Seriously wut? As somebody who plays a holy paladin, this is great. No matter how much shielding you have, it's going to hurt in Ulduar. You also are not thinking with your 3.1 hat on. Divine Plea is going to be up 100% for Prot. You are not going to be relying on SA to give you enough mana any more. <br />
<br />
The real issue is with the mana replenishment nerfs, healers need better ways to conserve mana, and this helps towards that.</div></div><hr />

i dont want any krit as restoration shaman on my 25 set!!! i am mindlessly spamming chainheal. krit from talents is more than enough for chain heal.<br />
we will lose some manaregeneration in 3.1 and the new set has lesser mp5 than 7.5, hooray.<br />

elemental shamans has been fixed... they should fix restoration shamans as well or add some non set items with haste and mp5 instead of krit and mp5.</div></div><hr />

I do agree that the stats need to be looked at on some of these item sets. However there is a lot of whining going on over how they look. Personally I don't think they are too bad, and wish to provide positive feedback in the midst of what sounds like tweens bitching because the Jonas brothers concert isn't coming to their town.<br />

I really like the warlock set. It stays true to the class in that I look at it, and immediately think warlock.<br />
<br />
I do like that mages don't have a robe. I hate having to where a dress just because I cast spells. This is not Scotland, it's warcraft.<br />
<br />
I really like the rogue set. I think it looks badass. <br />
<br />
I think the Plate sets could use a little work, I would love to see a little more design differences between the tanking and DPSing sets. For example the tank armor should look thicker and not have as many &quot;Sharp points&quot; for lack of a better term. DPS sets should have those &quot;Sharp points&quot; and be a little less thick.<br />
<br />
I love the druid set. Truly Blizzards most unique design to date.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alathas</div><div class="date">2009-03-27, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">here is my overall summary of the gear appearance:<br />
<br />
death knight: WIIIIIIIIIIIIIN! (&lt;3 how Mograine's armour is for 25 man not 10 man)<br />
Warriors: you look like paladins to be honest<br />
Shamans: nice, ulduar is earth themed and thus gear is control of over earth, follows in line with rest of sham gear<br />
paladins: ...lol. why is 25 man orange while 10 man is sexy white?<br />
warlocks: death to the scourge and death to the living! 25 man &gt; 10 man<br />
priests: ...the helm looks like its from a rogue. rest of it is sexy though<br />
rogue: you look like your a jack-in-the-box with the helm having a head on it, just lol<br />
druids: gear looks alright to be honest, but your shoulders have ovaries on them :)<br />
mages: very kiron-tor. im guessing the lol lack of robe is because it makes them more like &quot;battle mages&quot;<br />
hunters: /copy Death Knight, /paste hunter, /cut some sexyness.<br />
<br />
here is my overall summary of the set bonus of those i can be bothered to do:<br />
death knight: (DPS) set 2 bonus, win. RP dump more used than dual-rune abilities. set 4 just as win.<br />
(tank) set 2 bonus, nice, espec with glyph + sigil. set 4 bonus makes CD more usuable generally<br />
warriors: (DPS) set 2 bonus, 150% haste, lol. set 4, nice<br />
(tank) set 2 bonus, looks sexy. set 4 bonus, just reverse DK<br />
rogues: (guess :P) set 2 bonus, looks bad, but like the DK and war talents, stack, set 4, lol, epic win ;p<br />
<br />
for the gear, it looks like the DK, huntard, rogue and lock gear belong in naxxramas. ulduar is a super advanced place of the titans, not some plague hut. paladin t8.5 looks like shaman gear, again, wtf why is it orange not white like t8. sorry if i went on, 1st post ive done :&gt;</div></div><hr />

For the love of god why the hell did they make the 25 man version of the paladin T8 purple and the 10 man White. IT SHOULD BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND! <br />
And rogues look like Jelly babies....<br />
<br />
<br />
More like teletubbies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or maybe I just have exact opposite tastes of the developers. I do wonder what's going on in those meetings of theirs though, and if they truly hold pleasing the casual up above all else these days.</div></div><hr />

The holy gear is loaded with mp5 which no paladin actually wants instead of haste which every paladin does want. Protection is loaded with parry rating which no paladin actually wants. Unless the rest of the gear actually sucks I won't be going above the holy 2 set (2 pieces don't suck) and I won't be taking a single piece of protection tier 8. Good job Blizzard. Hell, I prefer 7.5 to tier 8 for the 2 set bonus although other than the hands and shoulders the rest of that was crap too.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you had read any posts by Blizzard recently, or in the past, you would know they itemize items badly on purpose. Icecrown Citadel items might be extremely good though, just like Sunwell items were.<br />
<br />
If set items had perfect itemization, there would be no reason at all to take any other items. What's the point of that?<br />

You have a different taste obviously. I prefer almost all the 25 man sets, the only one I don't is the pala one.</div></div><hr />

And ofc, to pay your game time, and wait until Icecrown raid instance opens up next year, or the year after that, as if heaven would come.. and then we can wear those perfectly itemized sets and gear for few months, before next expansion... <br />

<br />
First, the chest is rediculous top that says stab me in the stomach (as a girl I hate revealing ckests a.k.a. &quot;top&quot;). Second, once I see a tier set with a skirt, they screw it up putting better leggings...<br />
<br />
Well, hope they fix the tier... Probably they won't because they're blind.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">simplistics</div><div class="date">2009-03-28, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually it pretty much sucks. The last thing most tanks wanted was yet another shield (like the priest shield) that absorbed damage so that the healer didn't have to heal them. Warriors and druids might be ok with it because I think they changed the way rage generation worked but as a paladin I don't want damage to be absorbed, I want the healers to be healing me for the damage taken with no absorption. Every time I have damage absorbed instead of healed I'm losing out on mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nope most druids/warrior tanks will be more then happy to let there healer take a crack in the head from a mob for being a d-bag and shielding us cause we still gain most of our rage by being hit granted we still hit the mobs for rage but being hit generates more rage for us.</div></div><hr />

Please remove the spirit on Balance gear, it doesnt even provide mp5 for a raiding moonkin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
as far as stat changes, in particular ret set, it would prolly seem like most sets were probably overbudgeted a bit and were pulled more into line. at the end of the day it makes the hard mode items more appealing i suppose.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cryogenic</div><div class="date">2009-03-29, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not only is there tank like amounts of stam on dps plate the dk set has a blue socket in every piece.<br />
clearly you dont want anyone taking socket bonuses or set bonuses with haste and arp on gear now that DW has been murdered.<br />
<br />
You can purposely put poor stats on things but you shouldnt be making it pvp gear without resilience it's just fucking retarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im still a little bit concerned at the lack of MP5 on the shammy resto helm and gloves. Though I guess it will all work out<br />
<br />
<br />
not really, im a bit sceptical about this. with the nerf to mana regen in general (BoW and mana spring not stacking and all). haven't been on the ptr but...i don't think im going for the 4 set bonus</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was posted on the Tier 8 Preview section:<br />
<br />
<br />
These sets drop in Ulduar. Some of these parts can be bought with Emblems of Conquest dropping from bosses in the 25-Man version of Ulduar. For 25 Players sets, some parts can be bought with Emblems of Valor dropping from bosses in 25-man raid dungeons.<br />
<br />
What does this exactly mean?<br />
<br />
Some parts can be bought with Emblems of Conquest which drop from 25 man Ulduar and if you want the 25 player sets you can buy some parts with emblems of valor which also drop in 25 man ulduar?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlacKcuD</div><div class="date">2009-04-06, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i bet the second part refers to 10 man content and the t8 10er sets, because emblems of VALOR (naxx25) will now also drop from ulduar 10.</div></div><hr />
