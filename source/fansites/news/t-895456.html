After the druids and their allies thwarted the invasion of Hyjal by the Twilight's Hammer and Ragnaros, an air of peace settled on the sacred mountain. As new growth bloomed across the region, members of the Earthen Ring and Cenarion Circle, along with the noble Dragon Aspects, convened at the ancient World Tree of Nordrassil. Among the gathered heroes were the legendary archdruid Malfurion Stormrage, the former Horde warchief and accomplished shaman Thrall, and his strong-willed companion, Aggra. Together, this illustrious assemblage was to unite its wondrous powers and restore the World Tree for the good of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Yet this auspicious event ended in tragedy. The details are still unclear, but word has spread that an incredibly powerful Twilight's Hammer agent, shrouded to hide his identity, interrupted the ceremony and struck down Thrall with dark magics... casting his spirit into the four domains of the Elemental Plane. If these terrible rumors hold true, the Earthen Ring -- indeed, all of Azeroth -- has potentially lost one of its greatest champions.<br />
<br />
…Is this the end of the Son of Durotan? <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/april/JIH46FSS2MK51304073327041_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/april/JIH46FSS2MK51304073327041.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/april/P9C8B5483LG213040733388508_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/april/P9C8B5483LG21304073338850.jpg)<br />
<br />
In patch 4.2, level-85 characters will have the opportunity to answer this question and more.<br />
<br />
While even the Aspects concede that Thrall may be lost to the elements forever, there is one who still believes that he can be saved from this bleak fate. Aggra, a powerful shaman in her own right, will call upon you to assist her as she travels to the ends of the earth and beyond -- to Skywall, the Abyssal Maw, Deepholm, and Firelands -- to rescue her beloved from an eternity of torment.<br />
<br />
Thrall is no ordinary mortal, though, and this will be no ordinary quest. You will not only have to face the denizens of the elemental planes, but the very essence of Thrall himself and everything that has shaped him into the orc he is today. Before you can return his spirit to the natural world, you must overcome his doubts, his willfulness, his desires, and his rage -- for it is these aspects that bind him to his elemental cage.<br />
<br />

Are you up for this challenge? Can you break Thrall from his elemental bonds and ensure the restoration of the World Tree? The fate of the world, and one of its foremost heroes, hangs in the balance.</div></div><hr />

I guess this event gets ingame cinematic or well scripted event and not just quest saying like &quot;oh hi, did you know Thrall got disintegrated by some dark magic and now you have to reassemble him or this world will end?&quot;. <br />
And hopefully there will be a large and epic questchain more like wrathgate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It certainly is starting to sound interesting enough, and after the earlier preview+video the Firelands doesn't look all that bland any more either. Seems like Blizzard hasn't forgotten how to tell a good story after all...<br />
<br />
Now I'm just curious about whether there's a scripted or cinematic event for this meeting where Thrall gets assassinated (sounds like it, judging by Boub's response?), and... the models of the new armor sets.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not because it's Metzen's characters, it's because he's a main character of the entire storyline. A huge majority of main characters in books and movies usually survive without dying, even situations where they could have, because they're MAIN CHARACTERS. It's still possible, but why it's such a huge tick for some people seems strange to me. It'd be like asking why no one will ever kill Tyrande or why no one will ever kill Vol'jin. They're hugely important to the WoW lore, they're not gonna just die off because you have your panties in a bunch. Not to mention their power isn't on some scale YOU or your character could imagine, they're practically raid bosses in their own right, as city guardians have shown us.<br />
<br />
Lothar, Uther, and Arthas would like to have a word with you. Oh, and Bolvar, too (for your last bit).<br />
<br />
Important/main characters can die just fine. It's part of telling a story. <br />
Example: Story starts with characters A, B, and C. In the beginning, it seems like A is the main character, the hero, and B and C are just along for the ride. Part-way through the story, C double-crosses A and B. A dies a little later through some tragedy. B mourns for a bit, then C reveals that he was in fact a double-double-agent (lolwut?), and they continue on together. C eventually dies a gruesome death whilst helping B escape the same fate.<br />
In its sequel, B is assumed the main character...but wait! It's only a flashback, and come to find out he's only training a younger generation of heroes... :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
lol</div></div><hr />

If anything there are other Black Dragons out there suited for the role over a &quot;short-lived one&quot;.<br />
<br />
It is entirely plausible for Thrall to become the next Guardian of Tirisfal, but that also has someone who appears more suited for the role in Medivh's son Med'an.<br />
<br />
Personally I would think Thrall is best suited for a role as leader of The Earthen Ring. It's an ideal role for a shaman of his power and talents. Just as Malfurion appears as kind of the de facto leader of the Druids, perhaps the Guardians of Cenarius or the Cenarion Circle (the other de facto leader apparently being Hamuul Runetotem).</div></div><hr />

Well Azshara also could, but she doesn't have any reason to risk it. Garona probably could but her mind control has been broken. It could be that it's archibshop venedictus (the SW priest who was supposed to be with the hammer but then got his storyline removed) or even rommath.<br />
<br />
I wonder if there will ever be something this epic for an alliance character:( Also I as well do not want to see Thrall's desires . . . I suspect they involve a threesome with aggra and jaina.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats exactly what i thought. New aspect perhaps? Thought I do not like the idea of Thrall &quot;dieing&quot;, I do have to agree that this chain of events may lead to him becoming an extraordinary fixture in WoW lore. Not just the Son of Durotar, but the Aspect of /Blank/ or Guardian of /Something Awesome/<br />
<br />
As a long time Horde player. It makes it that much more awesome to play Horde.</div></div><hr />

Unlock a bunch of dailies and grind them endlessly until you get enough rep to unlock vendors.<br />

Sounds like Argent Tournament to me, which was one of the most tedious things they ever introduced in this game. If there is jousting involved in any way I think I'm going to shoot myself.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what I was thinking. They made no mention of the Abyssal Maw until this point. That means we're going to have a new big daily quest hub with personal progression, a new raid, a new zone, a NEW five-man, and another big max level quest chain so far.<br />
<br />
Plus that Dungeon Journal thing they mentioned.<br />
<br />
If they can start pumping these out like this at a decent pace, it will go a long way towards changing my attitude about Cataclysm in general.</div></div><hr />

Most easily answered question in the history of WoW.<br />
<br />
And call me crazy, but I'd like some light shed on why Aggra is so dedicated to Thrall all of the sudden. The last time I saw those two, Aggra was picking on Thrall's name and clothes. Now she's all &quot;rawwww, bring back my honey!&quot;? How... confusing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude, most of Horde players I know still think of Garrosh as the sidekick. Thrall is and forever will be the leader of the Horde.<br />
<br />
If they killed him off, the hald the horde players would be banned from blizzard forums for foul launguage cuzzing Blizzard out. It would be a pandemonium.</div></div><hr />

Metzen is going to make it that Thrall Does become the new aspect of earth.

<br />
This will kill off any notion of Thrall ever returning to the horde, even to the mortal plane of existance. He'll become the earth warden, held forever in that role as guardian of the earth, and never be who he was again. We're lose Thrall the same way we lost Bolvar.<br />
<br />

I really do feel if this is the way wow is going, then I'm not going to go back to it. And thats hard, given I've played this game for 6 years almost. I loved the gameplay, the story, the characters, my characters, and the friends I made on it.<br />
<br />
But the gameplay is slowly starting to desolve into something tiresome and repeated. The world feels far to linear unlike before. And the story, I held out hope... until reading the direction there taking Thrall in, and now I just realised, just like how they (activision-blizzard) ruined there own game, there ruining there own lore too. <br />
<br />
I'm upset this is what there going to do, and can't do anything to prevent it.</div></div><hr />

You don't get it do you? This isn't about character progression, so much as how there progressing. And how they are progressing is using the same bloody mechanics they did for Bolvar, only now on Thrall. And what happesn because of that? He will become, just like Bolvar, an absent character from the story, unable to return because of his permanent duty. The story would then be robbed of one of its best characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whats so 'unforgivable' about it? <br />
<br />
Before it was ever announced that Bolvar was going to sacrifice himself to control the undead menace (which BTW, I don't understand why he can't just make them all kill themselves; and yes, undead CAN die.) I had wondered what would happen when their puppet master disappeared. Obviously blizzard had to tie up this little lore-hole and they used the noble Bolvar.<br />
<br />
I am actually really excited for Thrall to become the earth warden. I want to see Thrall own. He has been held down by his mortal leadership responsibilities and I him being 'killed' and 'purified' (which is exactly what I thought too when I read that) is the coolest thing that could happen to him. Obviously everybody loved Thrall so much more than Garrosh, it's not even close. Blizzard knows this; I think they are going to make Thrall own, have him put into motion things that will lead to the end of WoW (I'm calling it right now, Thrall is going to be a crucial figure in the killing of Sargeras, which is widely accepted as the end of the biggest and baddest wow antagonist). I also think they are going to either kill off Garrosh and get a new awesome leader of the horde (I don't like this one) or they are going to redeem Garrosh as well as Thrall. Garrosh is too bloodthirsty for his own good; I could see him getting into too hot of water and getting stuck. Maybe he attacks something, the assault goes horrible, the public opinion of Garrosh plummets to nil and some else takes up the leadership of the horde. I'm also wondering if Thrall had ulterior motives for giving the leadership to Garrosh. Maybe Thrall wants him to fail or fall for some reason that we can't see right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that it would take far more balls, and evoke more emotion from players, if Thrall stayed dead. That's not what I'd like to see happen (self-admitted Thrall fanboy here) but anybody who hasn't seen this sort of thing coming for a long time is asleep at the lore wheel, and any time pivotal characters are resurrected it cheapens the emotional investment of the audience. (See also: superhero deaths). Death tends to lose its meaning--it's already unimportant to players outside of a raid fight, and to see major characters brought back just...well, like I said, it robs death of its meaning and emotional investment.<br />
<br />
Expanding the lore is one thing. But taking your favored characters (or main characters, or whatever you want to call them--that's the subject of another debate entirely) and promoting them up to more and more power isn't good writing.<br />
<br />
It's writing. But it's not good writing. <br />
<br />
Yes, characters progress. But honestly, the whole thing with Aggra is severely half-baked (even with lore outside of the game, she pretty much appeared a couple months ago and is now a pivotal character?) And there's a lot of discrepancy in Thrall's character. Leaving Garrosh in charge so that open war escalates with the Alliance again at the same time that the Horde races' allegiances are stretched tenuously thin? Putting Gallywix in charge of the Bilgewater Cartel? And this is the guy who is going to become the new Earth aspect? Gotta set some things straight first, imo...I loved Thrall as Warchief until Wrath, when he just started deferring to Garrosh and letting him screw up relations with the other races of WoW. I'm not sure I'd support him as the new aspect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Thrall becomes the Aspect of Earth, he will not be forgotten like Bolvar is on the throne somewhere no one will ever go.<br />
<br />
Thrall will forever take his place with the other aspects and dragons and will always show up with all the other aspecs.<br />

Nozdormu, the Timeless One <br />
Alexstrasza, the Life-Binder <br />
Ysera, the Dreamer <br />
Malygos, the Spell-Weaver <br />
Deathwing, the Earth Warder<br />
<br />
Whenever you see Alexa, she is never alone, She always has at least one other Aspect representative with her. Name one expansion where there were no aspects present? <br />
<br />
If Thrall ascends to the Aspect level, think about it, HE WILL GET DRAGON FORM. Dragon form with lightning hammers in his mouth and when he speaks he shoots lightning hammers at you.<br />
<br />
It that is not bad ass, you should quit the game.<br />

Blizzard's not going to write out one of their most iconic characters to a shadowy background presence. Sure, you can allude to Bolvar Fordragon, but before this mess with the Wrathgate and the Helm of Command, nobody knew who the fuck Bolvar was, only that he was babysitting/raising Anduin while Varian was gone and that if you attacked him the motherfucker had an AoE HoJ. Thrall helped pilot the Warcraft franchise to where it is now, and they won't just write him off to an incidental character for a handful of quests or a raid encounter that'll only be done once the level 85+ nostalgia kicks in.<br />
<br />
In conjunction with the Dragonwrath staff, Kalec is pushing for the dragons to have a more active role in the lives of the lesser races and to not withdraw from the world as Tarecgosa suggests. If Thrall is to become the new Aspect of Earth and the rest of the Wyrmrest Accord side with Kalecgos, I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more from the dragons.<br />
<br />
@Shambulanced:<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say Aggra is a &quot;pivotal character&quot;, but as the only one with close personal ties involved to Thrall, she's the obvious option to assist the players in getting him back. As Thrall's gal and a Mag'Hari shaman, it brings the quest chain to a more personal level. Sure you could sent another shaman of the Earthen Ring, but Aggra's his main squeeze, and has more reason to want him alive than anyone else. Hell, according to the BlueText, the Aspects have said that he's dead and gone, but clearly Aggra's not going to accept that out of love. It's less a &quot;WE HAVE TO SAVE THRALL OR WE'RE ALL FUCKED&quot; and more &quot;I HAVE TO SAVE THRALL BECAUSE I LOVE HIM&quot;.<br />
<br />
I admit that Thrall leaving Garrosh in charge was a boneheaded move, no matter how Blizzard tries to whitewash it that Thrall has faith in Garrosh and that Garrosh has changed and is growing up and all of that. I do however see that the orcs who followed Garrosh in Northrend wouldn't accept a non-orc as GM of Warchief, and Eitrigg, Saurfang, and Rexxar have all turned down (or would turn down) the position for various reasons. Garrosh was the logical choice in the way you have a choice of either grabbing the falling kitchen knife or letting it fall and potentially stabbing you in the foot.</div></div><hr />

This isn't about character progression, so much as how there progressing. And how they are progressing is using the same bloody mechanics they did for Bolvar, only now on Thrall. And what happesn because of that? He will become, just like Bolvar, an absent character from the story, unable to return because of his permanent duty. The story would then be robbed of one of its best characters.<br />
<br />
You're so right. I was sad when I joined WoW because I knew I would never see Alexstrasza in the main storyline ever again. Indeed, she has been remote and unmentioned but for the briefest of subtle hints, lost forever to us as we traverse Warcraft in its MMO incarnation. Just like Alexstrasza and the rest of the Aspects, Thrall will be locked away forever, never to be seen or heard from again.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Herecius</div><div class="date">2011-04-29, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Except that it would take far more balls, and evoke more emotion from players, if Thrall stayed dead. That's not what I'd like to see happen (self-admitted Thrall fanboy here) but anybody who hasn't seen this sort of thing coming for a long time is asleep at the lore wheel, and any time pivotal characters are resurrected it cheapens the emotional investment of the audience. (See also: superhero deaths). Death tends to lose its meaning--it's already unimportant to players outside of a raid fight, and to see major characters brought back just...well, like I said, it robs death of its meaning and emotional investment.<br />
<br />
Expanding the lore is one thing. But taking your favored characters (or main characters, or whatever you want to call them--that's the subject of another debate entirely) and promoting them up to more and more power isn't good writing.<br />
<br />
It's writing. But it's not good writing. <br />
<br />
Yes, characters progress. But honestly, the whole thing with Aggra is severely half-baked (even with lore outside of the game, she pretty much appeared a couple months ago and is now a pivotal character?) And there's a lot of discrepancy in Thrall's character. Leaving Garrosh in charge so that open war escalates with the Alliance again at the same time that the Horde races' allegiances are stretched tenuously thin? Putting Gallywix in charge of the Bilgewater Cartel? And this is the guy who is going to become the new Earth aspect? Gotta set some things straight first, imo...I loved Thrall as Warchief until Wrath, when he just started deferring to Garrosh and letting him screw up relations with the other races of WoW. I'm not sure I'd support him as the new aspect.<br />
I can certainly respect this opinion, and I definitely see where you're coming from. When it comes to books, I would totally agree with you, that the weight of a character's actual death, and the need for supporting characters with great depth is an absolute necessity in order to tell a good story.<br />
<br />
However, for me, Warcraft doesn't really need those things to have an awesome story in my eyes. The game's lore has, for me, always been about big, iconic characters. Powerful and familiar faces, with everything tying in to everything else in some way, if possible. I like the idea of Thrall being one of the big faces of Warcraft, and while it would be HUGE and a very ballsy move to actually kill him off, I don't know if it'd quite feel like the same Warcraft to me anymore. It would just feel like a game set in Warcraft's universe... but not actually Warcraft anymore.<br />
<br />
That said, I suppose he will have to die eventually. If the game ever actually gets to that point, perhaps I'll have revised my thinking. Hard to tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the gameplay is slowly starting to desolve into something tiresome and repeated. The world feels far to linear unlike before.

I always thought that Thrall knew Garrosh would make some mistakes and spark some wars, but that it would be the only way to show Garrosh the error of his ways.<br />

The Horde and Alliance are at war, Thrall learned this at the Battle for the Undercity. This is the best time to let Garrosh have a go.<br />

Staghelm was nobody's hero. He was a prick even just in Darnassus. <br />

Kirin Tor went neutral because they were intelligent enough to see a threat that would require unified mortal forces to defeat.<br />

Garrosh wont last. I would not be suprised if the Twilight agent is in fact Garrosh also. He would be power driven enough that if Twilight promised him that they would wipe out the alliance, he might take the deal.<br />
<br />
He is not a good leader, there are tons of references if you complete loremaster of his rash decisions and uncalculated moves. He is more of an Oaf than a leader. (see the flight to twilight highlands questline.. even goblins call Garrosh a mad man)<br />
<br />
I really do wish that Grom would be reinstated. If Grom wont make an appearance I would like to see one of these as Warchief:<br />

We all know he wont die. This is but a setback. He will be recreated most likely as an Aspect or a Guardian. <br />

NO! Alliance leaders are bad in nature soon or later they will be corrupted by something and guess who will go to save the world again Horde</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not because it's Metzen's characters, it's because he's a main character of the entire storyline. A huge majority of main characters in books and movies usually survive without dying, even situations where they could have, because they're MAIN CHARACTERS. It's still possible, but why it's such a huge tick for some people seems strange to me. It'd be like asking why no one will ever kill Tyrande or why no one will ever kill Vol'jin. They're hugely important to the WoW lore, they're not gonna just die off because you have your panties in a bunch. Not to mention their power isn't on some scale YOU or your character could imagine, they're practically raid bosses in their own right, as city guardians have shown us.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And illusion isn't really that difficult of a magic to use, or at least I wouldn't think it is as it never usually is, so it could be anyone really. A leader of the Twilight Hammer, Fandral, who knows. Either way, he disguises himself with magic and I'd imagine the three aspects are Red, Green, and Bronze, since Blue doesn't really have one and Black is...well, yeah. If Blue had a -powerful-, key word, aspect there, then I would question it as you'd think the protector of magic could see through that.<br />
<br />
Well, last Blizzcon Metzen did say that Kalecgos will be the new blue aspect. So it's possible that he will be chosen very soon.</div></div><hr />

You have a feck load of development and story in wotlk with your characters, infact it was more focused on the alliance and its past sins with Arthas then it was on the horde.<br />
<br />
2 - Laurcus, Cairne and Magni could be counted as main characters the same as vol'jin and tyrende, and there both dead now. <br />
<br />
3 - There is an obvious reason why Thralls soul is being 'purified' in the way you are having to fight is desires, dounts, willfulness and rage, because its going to be a case he will be 'cleansed' of these aspects of himself, so he can emerge as a perfect uncorrupt being, and thats enough to throw him into the role of dragon aspect. Why Else are we having to fight these aspects of Thralls character unless it was to cleanse him of those parts, and let him ascent to something else?</div></div><hr />

Before Thrall returned back to Azeroth from Nagrand, he did a vision quest with Aggra.<br />
<br />
Aggra showed him these things:<br />
Fire was the first element Thrall discovered when he fought in Durnhold Keep's arena (fury and rage).<br />
Water was the second element he discovered when he learned that Taretha Foxton (human who helped Thrall escape Durnhold) died (griefing and lamentation).<br />
Earth was the third element he discovered when Drek'thar was teaching Thrall (discipline and vigilance).<br />
Wind was the final element he discovered when he was the leader of the Horde (clear thoughts and senses).<br />

Those aspects are what made up Thrall as a person, but what it seems there verging us to do it fighting those aspects of his personality in a way to free him of the bad parts of him. But the shattering makes it clear those parts he faces are part of who he is. Why then are we being forced to fight those shards of him?</div></div><hr />

Probably because Thrall is the most powerful shaman on Azeroth, he's neutral and he's trying to mend the world. Pretty sure that's why we dont kill him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my opinion, Thrall would only temporarily become the aspect of Earth. There's that 'purified' black dragon egg from the Badlands who still has a story to unfold. It seems perfectly appropriate to me that, 'if' we are able to save Thrall (although I guess Go'el is more apt by now), he would be the Earth Warder only for as long as it takes this dragon to grow, then he will pass the mantle.<br />
<br />
If not that, once he dies, being a mortal, the mantle would be passed.<br />
<br />
Or, we might not 'save' Thrall, but instead might transfer his spirit/powers/knowledge to the dragon, to help it become the new aspect faster than it would normally be able to. A kind of good Lich-King scenario.</div></div><hr />

Also i'm pretty sure if their was a way to make thrall the new aspect that they have to follow the same routine the blue dragons are where the higher ups have to agree on a replacement and their is not a single black dragon that is not corrupted with the exception of an egg that has yet to hatch or mature.</div></div><hr />

And besides comon its Thrall we are talking about, who would be more suited to care for the earth plane of azeroth.<br />
<br />
And no ofc deathwing is not dead yet. We know that deathwing is probably just a puppet of a old god lurking around, when the day comes to defeat deathwing there will probably be an epic event and fight including thrall and some of the other aspects.<br />
So when we kill deathwing thrall will probably be there to help us much like tirion at LK.<br />
These things will become clear soon enough, but remember that metzen basicly said it out loud at blizzcon 2010 that &quot;my boy thrall might have a greater destiny and when deathwing goes who is to become the new earthwarden?&quot;<br />

<br />
So far Blizzard has held pretty religiously to existing lore. Wrath was an MMO version of Warcraft 3. I went back and played WC3 about 6 months ago and was surprised at how much NPC text was copied word for word from that game. Espcially in Dragonblight with the quests figuring out what happened to Arthas and his men. So it is no surprise that they have a book that they are using as a guideline for stuff this time around. Blizz makes an effort to keep the lore the same across all the media spectrums.</div></div><hr />
