Peak of Serenity<br />
Monks get a new spell called Zen Pilgrimage (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/126892) at level 30, which teleports them to the Peak of Serenity, a part of Kun-Lai Summit. This area is likely to function similar to the Death Knight starting area.<br />
<br />
Currently it isn't very populated, just a few monk trainers and some students, but that is likely to change in a future patch. When a Monk wants to return, they can cast Zen Pilgrimage: Return (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/126895), which should return them to a safe location that is near from where they left.<br />

Level 90 Talent Animations Preview<br />
The video we posted yesterday did not show spell effects at maximum particle density due to a change in the Mists of Pandaria client that we were not aware of. When other players cast a spell, you will see the low quality version, no matter how high your game settings are set. This made some of the effects look weak, like in this example (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/june/spellDiff.jpg).<br />
<br />
We also looked at the effects in a more neutral colored zone and made some easier to see. Give your class another look if you had effects that depended on spell effects being turned up!<br />

Jade Forest Going Offline in Next Beta Patch<br />
With the next patch to the World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria beta, we will be temporarily removing the Jade Forest zone. We’re going to be making improvements to the zone, and want to put the focus of testing on other areas during this time.<br />
<br />
As a result, starting with this next beta patch (which is coming soon™), you will find that you are no longer able to enter Jade Forest. If you have any characters that are hanging out in Jade Forest when the zone is disabled, they will be automatically ported out to the following locations:<br />
<br />
<br />
Valley of the Four Winds (for Horde characters)<br />
Krasarang Wilds (for Alliance characters)<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters that need experience to continue testing can visit either Orgrimmar or Stormwind. In each faction city, there will be an NPC that provides a quest which will reward enough XP to boost your characters from 85 to 86, as well as send you to Valley of the Four Winds to continue questing from there.<br />
<br />
We expect Jade Forest to be offline for an extended period of time; we’ll provide further details as we progress with our updates to the zone. Thank you for testing Mists of Pandaria! <br />
<br />

&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/november/d3.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:-2px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom&quot; /&gt; Diablo III Real-Money Auction House ToS Update<br />
You now need an authenticator to use Battle.net balance and the RMAH.<br />
In preparation for the upcoming launch of the real-money auction house, we will be updating the Diablo® III Auction House (http://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/company/legal/d3rmah_tou.html) Terms of Use and Battle.net Terms of Use (http://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/company/about/termsofuse.html) to cover some key changes related to the account-security measures required to use Battle.net Balance. Later today, the following updates will be made to the Terms of Use available on our website, and when the real-money auction house goes live, all players will be asked to re-read and accept these changes the next time they play Diablo III.<br />
<br />
Battle.net Balance and Authenticator Update<br />
With the introduction of the real-money auction house, account security will become more important than ever. To help ensure that players have a positive experience when using the real-money auction house, we’ve made some adjustments to how players can use and access their Battle.net Balance.<br />
<br />
Starting today, in order to use Battle.net Balance (http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/blog/3675249), players will be required to have a Battle.net Authenticator or Battle.net Mobile Authenticator attached to their Battle.net account. For clarity, this means you’ll need to have an Authenticator to add to your balance via Battle.net Account Management or to send the proceeds of your real-money auction house sales to your Battle.net Balance.<br />
<br />
Please note that players who previously added Battle.net Balance to their account prior to this change will be able to use it to make eligible purchases (http://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/battle-net-balance-faq) on Battle.net and in the auction house without attaching an Authenticator. However, an Authenticator will be required to add to your balance in the future, as explained above.<br />
<br />
While we understand that this may be an inconvenience for some players, we want to ensure that players feel confident when using Battle.net Balance to make auction house transactions.<br />
<br />
You can learn more about the Battle.net Authenticator, Battle.net Mobile Authenticator, and other account security information by clicking here (http://eu.battle.net/support/en/bnet/accounts-security). <br />

<br />
My understanding is anyone will be able to use the RMAH with or without access to your Battle.net Balance but since you can't add funds to your balance (for auction fees) or withdraw/use any of the money you get, it'd be largely pointless.</div></div><hr />

They might not release the game in August or September, but just because they apply changes to Jade Forest does not mean the game will be delayed. I don't see the logic in that. It's weird that you see that as &quot;irrefutable evidence to the contrary&quot;.</div></div><hr />

An Authenticator is not even a minor inconvenience unless you are a total monkey. What I don't understand is why you can take off the authentication token and spend from your Blizzard Fun Money balance. Although, anyone who gets a token just to add funds for the RMAH and then removes it deserves to get pounded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
seriously?<br />
<br />
you don't see the logic in the fact that taking the entire starting zone offline for an extended period of time to revamp it and re-test it in beta will affect the release date?<br />
<br />
and it's irrefutable evidence in that when you combine this info with the fact that major content such as Raids haven't even been implemented on beta yet and the known fact that it takes 2 months from the date they press the gold master CD, at the conclusion of beta, to the day they release the game (Diablo III latest example - March announcement - May release) then anyone with an iota of knowledge about how this process works would know the absolute earliest and most optomistic date for release is now september<br />

Oh no the fanboy card :/<br />
<br />
For all we know this was planned. I've never argued for a release date in August or September, that seems unreasonably close. Personally I think a release date in October is more realistic. But let's just see what they actually do in that zone, before we jump to conclusions.</div></div><hr />

the nudge, nudge comment is from monty python and discussing almost anything on this site is pretty useless tbh when people live in either an altered reality or just like to troll when faced with common sense conclusions.<br />

You have not started with intelligence to begin with. You based all your argument on the big assumption that the zone is closed for revamp. Something that you *can't* know for certain. You *suppose* that it is the reason as you have no *factual evidence* that the zone is offline for revamp.<br />
<br />
As another said it is possible that they are guiding the tests elsewhere (as they did at the beginning to test the pandaren starting areas) if they see that people stuck in that zone and not testing anything else.<br />
You may be right, or you may be wrong, no one is denying that this can be the reason, we are just exploring possible other reasons for this. But you're the one that we can't discuss with because *you* are the one that have closed the windows to any other possibility if not your own ideas and that per se has *no discussion values* also again with the fanboy card you just burned any possible chance of discussion because &quot;you don't agree with me so you're a fanboy or brainwhased&quot; and that does not create ground for discussion.<br />
<br />
Reality is that you don't want to *discuss* anything you're just looking for people nodding at your ideas to nurture your ego.</div></div><hr />

You may be right, or you may be wrong, no one is telling you that what you said is totally wrong, we are exploring possibilities and possible other reasons for this. But you're the one that we can't discuss with because *you* are the one that have closed the windows to any other possibility if not your own ideas and that per se has *no discussion values* also again with the fanboy card you just burned any any other possible chance of discussion because &quot;you don't agree with me so you're a fanboy or brainwhased&quot; that burn any possible ground for discussion.<br />
<br />
Reality is that you don't want to *discuss* anything you're just looking for people nodding at your ideas to nurture your ego.<br />
<br />
Seriously...thanks for proving my point<br />
<br />
adding to my previous comment about not being able to discuss anything with people living on another planet I just got trashed for making assumptions and having no proof<br />
<br />
so I WILL QUOTE FROM THE BLUE POST DIRECTLY:<br />
<br />
With the next patch to the World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria beta, we will be temporarily removing the Jade Forest zone. We’re going to be making improvements to the zone, We expect Jade Forest to be offline for an extended period of time; we’ll provide further details as we progress with our updates to the zone.<br />
<br />
apparently only on a wow fansite can &quot;be making improvements&quot; and &quot;further details as we can progress with our updates to the zone&quot; not actually mean they are doing what they say they are doing<br />

I missed a few lines in the blue text<br />
<br />
However, Improvements =/= revamp<br />
<br />
and they also stated &quot;and want to put the focus of testing on other areas during this time.&quot; so both points end up to be somwewhat valids<br />
<br />
extende period of time can mean few hours or few days not necessarily &quot;months&quot;<br />
There are also extended maintenance but they are some hours longer than normal one *shrug*</div></div><hr />

<br />
and you can't discuss something with people not willing to face facts, reality etc - that guy said he didn't think it would be released to october to begin with but also didn't think revamping an entire zone would contribute to such a late release date and that taking this zone offline for extended period to revamp it was probably planned <br />
<br />
not deriding anyone who can up with an intelligent response to begin with<br />
<br />
and with that I will say no more<br />
<br />
Wow, some one woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.<br />
<br />
People are going to be far more reception to badly articulated ideas if you don't come across as a jerk and try and attack them with every post. For the record, I think you're right. I'm now predicting a mid August release, but not because of this information, I'm going from the fact that 5.0 isn't on the PTR yet, it's close, but it's not there.<br />
<br />
From pre-expansion PTR to expansion usually takes two months, as it did from Wrath to Cataclysm - our most recent basis for comparison.<br />
<br />
Raid content has probably been done and ready to ship out for testing for a while now, it's just how stuff's done, heroic testing comes first.<br />
<br />
Just calm down, so you've found someone who disagrees with you, welcome to the world and especially the internet. There's plenty more out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then why are you on a WoW fansite? &quot;WoW fanboys on a WoW fansite? Inconceivable!&quot; They are applying changes to the zone, likely based on Beta feedback. Some of those changes while in progress will make the zone unplayable. Instead of having numerous complaints about more bugs in the zone, the result of unfinished changes, they've simply decided to redirect players away from the zone. That is the simplest, most reasonable explanation. Your explanation that Blizzard considers the zone completely broken and are &quot;revamping&quot; it is an extremist explanation based on the assumption that Blizzard is incapable of releasing their products in a timely manner. It is not indisputable proof; only a baseless assumption.<br />
<br />
Everyone has their predictions on when MoP will release. But that's all they are - predictions. This news on Jade Forest doesn't change anything, and your condescending tone is not warranted and certainly not needed.</div></div><hr />

As for Jade Forest, sorry to burst your bubble, but they are not doing major quest revamps or any new secret stuff. The downtime is to optimize the new cross realm/ multi-zone feature, which will need to be used extensively in Jade Forest to prevent Hellfire Pen issues (since 95% of a servers population will be in that one zone the first week). More specifically, they are optimizing the way it will work on pvp realms to balance factions when a single realm has more than one ´copy´of Jade Forest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This response is so full of win...<br />
<br />
First, everyone and their dogs knows that they internally test stuff and are several builds ahead of beta. That fact in no ways explains why they have to take the zone offline for &quot;an extended period of time&quot; (blue words) to &quot;update&quot; it. In fact, according to your logic, these changes should have already have been made and tested and not require the zone being offline &quot;for an extended period of time&quot;.<br />
<br />
Second, to the best of my knowledge there was no F&amp;F Alpha for MoP due to the fact that Beta was open to APers (and if there was ever an F&amp;F beta I'm pretty sure MMO Champion would have mentioned it at some point).<br />
<br />
Thirdly, where is there any proof that the largest beta in history &quot;is a very old version&quot; and the rate of its deployment on the servers, is different then the rate they deployed new content in previous betas and is negatively affected by the AP nature of this Beta. If you're going to make such claims it would be useful to actually have some evidence to support that.<br />
<br />
Fourth, they could well be fine tuning the cross-realm features as part and parcel of the &quot;updates&quot; to the zone. However, if that was their sole purpose, another claim you make without absolutely any evidence to back up your assertion, then why not come out and say that. They simply and straightforwardly could have said we are taking the zone offline to improve/de-bug/ensure the feature and your gameplay experience are top notch or words to that effect. But that is not what they said. So, according to your baseless assertion as to what they are doing, they have released a misleading statement that implies &quot;new&quot; things or &quot;updates&quot; to the zone not previously shared with the community but are actually just tweaking an already announced feature. anyone with any understanding of marketing would know that using vague or misleading language that may raise expectations of unannounced changes is an unwise idea and bad public relations if all you are doing is fine tuning an already announced feature.<br />
<br />
Lastly, if they are indeed tweaking the cross-realm feature - &quot;for an extended period of time&quot; then their internal builds are not nearly as far ahead as you think they are. And since you claim this feature is vitally important to a successful launch of MoP this is precisely the type of feature that needs to be stressed tested in a massive public beta. So after the &quot;extended period of time&quot; that the zone is offline they will have to spend another week or two subjecting this feature to a live beta stress test. This, of course, suggests that the beta testing of MoP will last longer than anticipated and the release date will be delayed by at least a few weeks.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm merely taking Blizzard at their word and doing some very basic math that suggests that these &quot;updates&quot; requiring the zone to be offline &quot;for an extended period of time&quot; will delay the release beyond August, a date many were unrealistically hoping for. Simple math and logic. Im sorry it is so difficult for you to accept.</div></div><hr />

I'm still betting on August release, myself. I'm not sure they can wait much longer than that without losing a large number of subs. Things are already pretty dead on the servers with raiding pretty much done for the xpac and 7 out of 10 peeps on my real id are playing Diablo... I'm just not sure they can put it off for much longer than mid summer. Peeps at Blizz aren't newbs. They are aware of the short attention spans prevalent in the gaming community.

You right I did leave twice but felt compelled to respond to that post.<br />
<br />
The funny thing, throughout my posts, I never said it was a bad thing they were taking the zone offline for &quot;an extended period of time&quot; but rather merely speculated on how it would effect the release date. <br />
<br />
In fact it may actually be a good thing. <br />
<br />
Considering how SWTOR's launch was negatively impacted by being rushed to market and all the heat Blizzard has taken over all the problems with D3's launch and major content delays (error 37, AH instability, RMAH and PvP not available on launch) the fact that they may be slowing down to improve, update, de-bug aspects of MoP may ultimately be better for all concerned.<br />
<br />
It was somewhat funny to see the over the top responses to a mere suggestion, albeit based on common sense and taking blizzard at their word, that was evoked by my original posts.<br />
<br />
Feel free to call me out in August if I'm wrong...only time will tell.</div></div><hr />

What is funny is that people who constantly make over the top negative comments think reasonable people are ´over the top´ and unreasonable. It couldn´t possibly be you who is extreme.. it obviously is everyone else who is crazy.<br />
<br />
D3´s launch was fine, they said months before launch that PVP wouldn´t be included... and really, nobody wanted it at launch anyway since why bother to pvp when you are replacing gear so rapidly. Same thing with the RMAH.. it wasn´t delayed at the last minute, it was planned for awhile to work the way it is working.<br />
<br />
And same thing with SWTOR.. I am not sure what you consider rushed, but SWTOR was fine.. the gameplay is boring and slow, and they spent way to much money on voice-acting.. but the game was polished without tons of bugs.<br />
<br />
I think you are living in a dream world were these companies should sit on a product for a year to squeeze every last issue before launch. Sorry kid, these aren´t play companies. Blizzards launches are never perfect, but they are better than every other gaming company out there. Maybe in your fantasy land a company can launch a MMORPG perfectly.. but not in the real world where companies need to make money.</div></div><hr />
