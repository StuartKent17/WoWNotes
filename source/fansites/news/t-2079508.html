World Boss - Levantus<br />
Don't forget to stop by and kill Levantus (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/108829-levantus) this week! There is a world quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43192-terror-of-the-deep) and potential for loot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/595-Legion-World-Bosses#Levantus)!<br />

Recent Warden Tower Changes<br />
As many players have noticed, we’ve been iterating somewhat rapidly on the rewards and cadence of the Warden Tower PvP World Quests. We wanted to take a moment to explain what’s happening, and why we’ve been tinkering with them so much.<br />
<br />
Our goal for Warden Towers is that they should feel fun and rewarding, but still secondary to Arenas and Battlegrounds as an overall source of Honor. When Legion first launched, they were certainly lucrative, but so frequent that many players were earning the vast majority of their Honor by completing them. We tried to correct this by increasing the time it took for them to refresh, and reducing the amount of Honor they gave, but that brought us to the other extreme – they were no longer a primary source of Honor, but they didn’t feel rewarding enough for the time investment.<br />
<br />
With the latest updates, we’ve increased the Honor rewarded for completing a Warden Tower back to 300, but they will only re-activate once every 24 hours. This means you should once again feel that completing one is worth your time, but you’ll still need to look to Arenas and Battlegrounds for the majority of your Honor. Warden Towers should now be properly filling their intended role in end-game PvP progression.<br />
<br />
<br />
Weekly Bonus Event: Arena Skirmishes<br />
Bonus Events have returned in World of Warcraft: Legion, and the first is underway with a focus on Arena PvP. <br />
<br />
What Are Bonus Events?<br />
<br />
The Bonus Events system consists of a rotating schedule of different activities, currently scheduled to run each week beginning on Tuesdays. Each Bonus Event grants a passive bonus to a particular game activity and offers a once-per-event quest with a noteworthy reward for accomplishing a related goal. The in-game calendar can serve as your one-stop reference for the event schedule. The Adventure Guide also offers a direct link to active Bonus Events, allowing you to easily accept any associated quests.<br />
<br />
Sharpen your swords and reinforce your boards, because you’re called to the PvP Arena for the hectic mayhem of Skirmishes.<br />
<br />
This Week: Arena Skirmishes<br />
All week, from anywhere in Azeroth, open the Group Finder (default hotkey: i), select the Player vs. Player tab on the bottom of the window, and then under Arena Battles, choose either 2v2 or 3v3 and JOIN BATTLE. You’ll be matched up with teammates and provided with opponents to kill in the Arena.<br />
<br />
Look for the following all week long:<br />
<br />
<br />
Archmage Lan’dalock near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest for you.<br />
<br />
Quest requirement: Win 10 Arena PvP Skirmishes<br />
Reward: A PvP loot box<br />
<br />
Passive buff: +50% honor gains from Skirmishes<br />
<br />
<br />
If you’ve been looking to make some Honor gains, this is the week to do it!<br />
<br />
<br />

Raid Finder and Quest Chains<br />
It is intentional that the quests “In Nightmares (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43520-in-nightmares)” and “Essence of Power (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43521-essence-of-power)” cannot be completed on Raid Finder difficulty. That quest chain is intended to provide a cosmetic reward for participating in organized, non-matchmade content. As such, we wanted to keep this step in line with the previous steps in the chain, which require completing Mythic Dungeons.<br />
<br />
This restriction is specific to this quest chain, which has a cosmetic-only reward. Other quest chains, such as “The Stuff of Dreams” from the Suramar campaign, will be completable through Raid Finder. We’ll be making some additional changes in Patch 7.1 to more clearly communicate when and where these restrictions apply.<br />
<br />
Thanks for confirming the inevitable. I'll be saving some money every month now, because I am done with this game. If this is intended and staying in the game, you just lost a customer. It is clear blizzard is clueless about their own game. I guess it's true, no King lives forever. Good luck everyone. Blizzard, you failed.<br />
Again, a cosmetic reward we are reserving for those who participate in organized, non-matchmade content.<br />
<br />
This is not something you, by any means, &quot;need&quot;. And &quot;needing&quot; it on every alt, doubly so. If you desire it, then organize a raid or join a guild that will put you in their raiding ranks and dedicate the time to obtaining the items.<br />
<br />
We simply disagree that these skins should be handed out without dedication and challenge.<br />
<br />
I appreciate constructive feedback and discussion on this topic, and will discuss what's here with the developers once it's had time to settle, but anything that says &quot;the world is ending&quot; or &quot;blizzard is killing their player-base&quot; because not everyone will get a cosmetic skin is a bit of a fallacy. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/770635-official-cant-complete-raid-quests-contd/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20749196493?page=6#113))<br />
<br />
Cross-Realm Zones<br />
We've stated this numerous times, but this is not new. CRZ has existed in Broken Isle zones since launch, however you may not have seen it active due to the amount of players leveling the same zone on your server.<br />
<br />
Cross-realm technology activates automatically. I suspect that you may be seeing people from other realms since LFR opened today, and many players are trying out that newly opened content (hence, less players in the &quot;world&quot;). It's also 3pm PST on a weekday, which isn't what I'd consider peak-time.<br />
<br />
No. People are confused because CRZ has never before been active on current content. Pandaria wasn't CRZ'd until 6.0. Draenor wasn't CRZ'd until 7.0.<br />
We've had a bit of a shift in philosophy here with this expansion; some of this shift was influenced by the implementation of World Quests across Legion content. This would explain why CRZ was turned on for Pandaria with 6.0, but is active in 7.0 content now.<br />
<br />
A bit of a larger conversation, part of which doesn't really fit a forum post from myself.<br />
<br />
Again, just to reiterate, CRZ is intentional, but it should be not be massively disrupting the world and/or day-to-day activities. Seeing players from other realms is normal, seeing thousands of them, not so much.<br />
<br />
It makes more sense now why it's happening so much after server restarts. People start logging in, CRZ code says &quot;woah there's hardly any people in this area, TO THE MERGEMOBILE&quot;, then goes and takes a nap for 8 hours before realizing &quot;hey i just put too many people together, oopsie-doodle&quot;.<br />
I can't say for sure, but in my head this makes sense.<br />
<br />
People are working, at school, or otherwise offline after our maintenance and restarts (Tuesdays, amirite?) - which would, in turn, activate CRZ.

Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
sorry if it's been answered but is the pvp trinkets not working in pvp intended or bug rn??<br />
intended. No trinkets, set bonuses or enchants work in PvP (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/779152175050010624))<br />
<br />
are artifact traits with %dmg increase after you unlock all 34, going to be useable in rated pvp? I hope not<br />
No they are not (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/779376592795480064))<br />
<br />
Is it correct to assume the prestige rewards remain the same throughout seasons? Such as the bronze courser mount will still be awarded at that level in the next season, and new mount at later levels?<br />
Yes. Current plan is to increase max prestige each season, with more rewards. Prestige level will not be reset until the next expansion. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/779433947981688832))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Nomi is giving me recipes I already know. Intended?<br />
There was a bug with rank 1 bacon, specifically. It will be fixed in Patch 7.1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/779430477962719232))<br />
<br />
Any chance that Alchemists could see some love with a bottomless flask in 7.1? 500 Primary Stat?<br />
Probably not in 7.1, but the idea isn't off the table for the future. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/779430726563270656))<br />
<br />
I am no herbalist, still i get herbalism world quests. Probably a bug?<br />
This is intended, and will happen sometimes. Non-Herbalists can complete these quests using the Auction House, shoulder enchants, alts, etc. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/779431092990259200))<br />
<br />
Cooking, why do Legion Feasts take 300 stat food, to create a 200 stat feast? This devalues feasts incredibly<br />
A few reasons, but the biggest is that single-use food gives secondary stats, while feasts give primary stats. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/779433051734495232))</div></div><hr />

I don't have that much time to do even normal raids, but tbh they aren't that challenging. Mostly people make it that way, now with &quot;link achievement&quot; or &quot;legendary needed&quot; type.<br />
<br />
I don't think cosmetic should be gated this way. Most of the people, who aren't raiders on any level, are in for the cosmetics, lore, other content. Yes, you can do normal with premade easily, but still... not quite spot on with this.</div></div><hr />

Basically Blizzard started to support raid boosts for gold or irl money. Casual players have not enough skill or time to do progress raiding. Nowadays normal raids are on the level of the old wotlk BC first raid bosses which is btw really insane.<br />

I highly doubt Timezones have anything to do with maintenance since, US is 6-9 hours is behind EU.<br />

&quot;- Here is a long questline but wait you need a hardcore raiding guild to get it done! Joke on you!&quot;<br />
....and I know you will say: &quot;you don't need a hardcore guild for that!&quot; <br />
But guess what? I was in a lot of REAL casual raider guild and most of the time after a few 1st &amp; 2nd boss kills they just stop (on normal).<br />
<br />
Basically Blizzard started to support raid boosts for gold or irl money. Casual players have not enough skill or time to do progress raiding. Nowadays normal raids are on the level of the old wotlk BC first raid bosses which is btw really insane.<br />
<br />
And again they broke their promise: &quot;LFR is for to see the content.&quot;<br />
<br />
Never seen a more moronic comment.<br />
<br />
1) Normal does not require a &quot;hardcore raiding guild&quot;. You can pug normal difficulty whenever you want<br />
2) Normal raids are a joke, they have more or less the difficulty of MoP flexible raid, meaning everyone who has two hands, a brain and a couple of hours per week can do it<br />
3) You don't even need to complete the whole raid, you can basically do the easiest 3-4 bosses all over again to get the quest objects. It will take much longer tho<br />
4) If you can't invest so little time or don't even have the minimum skill required for normal raiding, you shouldn't get rewards for free<br />
5) Lastly, by removing cosmetic and high ilvl gear rewards from LFR they indeed kept the &quot;promise&quot; about LFR being there just to see the content</div></div><hr />

It is intentional that the quests “In Nightmares” and “Essence of Power” cannot be completed on Raid Finder difficulty. That quest chain is intended to provide a cosmetic reward for participating in organized, non-matchmade content. As such, we wanted to keep this step in line with the previous steps in the chain, which require completing Mythic Dungeons.<br />

I seriously can't believe it's even an issue. The only thing Blizzard did wrong was not properly communicate that these skins were organized raid only, so now all the LFR heroes are going nuts for some reason.<br />
<br />
I am an LFR hero as well. I haven't raided regularly in years and my schedule isn't all that great. I am a bit disappointed because I thought I was going to get that skin, but otherwise I don't care. Way too many entitled players.</div></div><hr />

If you can't get the &quot;first&quot; one in a line unlocked, you can't use the other tints even when you unlock those. So if you don't do some normal raids, then your dungeon hero, mythic keystone achieve, and whatever the other one is are useless. Which is gating unrelated rewards behind normal raiding. Which is silly. If you get the valorous tint, you should be able to use it, regardless of which order you unlock the tints in :/</div></div><hr />

Why has Blizzard decided to make the other people in the game world just window dressing (which is all they are in CRZ land) rather than feel like actual people in your game world that you will meet time and again, and see back in town later that evening? CRZ changes the feel of this game so much. Does Blizzard really hate server communities so much?<br />
<br />
After all the talk of legacy servers and how people want the sense of community back it would seem Blizzard would like the opposite. I REALLY hate seeing people from other servers. They're annoying ghosts that I can't interact with. I can't trade with them I can't be in a guild with them and I most likely will never see them again. They're like useless AI running around. It makes it so when I do see people on my server I don't even know cause I ignore them too thinking they're probably just ghosts.

Exactly. We don't need 4 raid and N dungeon difficulties. Normal &amp; Heroic was all we needed. <br />

Mythic0 should be included in LFD and we can get rid of normal if the only difference to LFR is that you cannot use the LFR tool but have a similar difficulty.</div></div><hr />

Lol most biggest pile of crap I've ever heard. Casual does not mean they just stop after a few bosses in normal at all. I'm in a casual guild and we just finished normal and are progressing heroic slowly while going back and doing normal. So no you don't need a hardcore guild to go do EN on normal whatsoever. EN Normal is very very easy. Also are you being denied any bosses with Emerald Nightmare on LFR?</div></div><hr />

I agree with this, however it would only apply to that one row that starts with &quot;Balance of Power&quot; achieve. The others are probably fine to gate based on the first column being unlocked (PVP, Hidden, Class Campaign, etc)</div></div><hr />

I consider myself casual, I play in a guild that considers itself semi-hardcore. I raid 6 hours a week (in the grand scheme of things, that's hardly anything) we achieve decent Mythic progress in the past, easy heroic clears e.t.c<br />
<br />
Your argument is invalid. The biggest thing I've seen to be a problem in casual raiding guilds is the &quot;lets just have fun&quot; &quot;anybody is welcome&quot; attitude, I'm sorry, but no. If you invite Jimmy, even though he's a liability just because fun, your not gonna get very far. Unfortunately, even Normal isn't forgiving enough when half your raid team like to semi-afk standing in fire.<br />
<br />
Normal is doable with even half a brain, we went in without even knowing the tactics for the last 2 bosses, and 1 shot Cenarius still anyway, Normal is not in any way hard.</div></div><hr />
