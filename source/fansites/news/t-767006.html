Almost six months ago we announced that Cataclysm raids were being redesigned to make both raid sizes the same difficulty, drop the same quality of loot, and exist in the same lockout. This evolution in raid philosophy is built on the belief that the size of your raiding group should be a choice based solely on what's more fun and enjoyable for you, and that you should not have to complete the same raiding content twice in a week to maximize your character's progression. These systems are the culmination of a great deal of design and player feedback from the last few years. With the release of the 4.0.1 patch, the new Flexible Raid Lock system will debut in Icecrown Citadel and The Ruby Sanctum.<br />
<br />
With the Flexible Raid Lock system, instead of being locked to a specific raid size or raid group, each character will have the opportunity to defeat each raid encounter once a week. You could kill Lord Marrowgar and Lady Deathwhisper with a 10-player raid on Wednesday, join a 25-player raid to kill Festergut and Rotface on Thursday, and then lead a completely new 10-player raid to kill The Lich King on Friday. Every raid has a list of encounters associated with the zone. For example, Icecrown Citadel has twelve encounters. After you defeat Lord Marrowgar, you can open up your character's raid information dialog and see the list of encounters in Icecrown Citadel with Marrowgar marked as defeated. You may no longer fight Lord Marrowgar with any raid size or difficulty until the weekly raid reset for your region occurs.<br />
<br />
Another key change is that if you join someone else's raid in progress, you are no longer locked to that raid after merely zoning in. Your raid status will only change when a boss is defeated, at which point it will be updated to reflect the state of the instance in which you are currently participating. So, let's say you have killed the first four bosses of Icecrown Citadel, and you then join a raid that has defeated the first four encounters, as well as Festergut and Rotface. The dialog that displays upon entering Icecrown Citadel will show that the raid has defeated 6 of 12 encounters. If you help them defeat Professor Putricide, then you would be marked as having defeated not only Professor Putricide for the week, but also Festergut and Rotface. If instead after joining the raid you then proceeded to wipe ten times to Professor Putricide, you could leave the raid with only the first four bosses marked as completed.<br />
<br />
To help communicate to players which bosses are dead in the raid leader's raid, there is new functionality to link in chat a list of the encounters the raid has defeated. So before you join a raid, you can see what they've already defeated. If a raid leader advertises in chat that she needs another healer for an 8/12 Icecrown Citadel run, you can see precisely which bosses are still available to fight. If you were only looking for that one item from Queen Lana'thel that never drops for you and this raid already defeated her, you will know not to join that raid.<br />
<br />
Let's look at another example of the Flexible Raid Lock system. A guild schedules three nights for 25-player Icecrown Citadel raiding on Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. On Wednesday, the raid defeats Lord Marrowgar, Lady Deathwhisper, Icecrown Gunship Battle, and Saurfang. On Thursday, five people cancel their raid attendance due to real life emergencies. The raid leader knows that if he cancels Thursday raiding, there's little chance they'll have enough time on Saturday to defeat the other eight bosses in Icecrown Citadel. So he splits the remaining 20 Thursday raiders into two 10-player raids. Each new raid enters Icecrown Citadel and defeats Rotface, Festergut, Blood Council, and Valithria Dreamwalker. The next Saturday with all 25 players online, they reform as a 25-player raid and enter Icecrown Citadel once more. Only Professor Putricide, Queen Lana'thel, Sindragosa, and The Lich King remain. After a tough fight, the Lich King falls and everybody celebrates. Without the Flexible Raid Lock system the entire raid probably would have missed out on a night of raiding, and likely would not have reached the Lich King.<br />
<br />
While players can freely move between raids of different sizes in normal difficulty, there are some additional rules for Heroic difficulty. If a 10- or 25-player raid defeats a boss on Heroic difficulty, then those players may now only raid additional Heroic encounters with that specific raid. If your Heroic 25-player raid defeats the first four bosses of Icecrown Citadel on Heroic, then they may not split up into two 10-player raids and continue to fight in Heroic difficulty. You may also not join someone else's raid if they have defeated a Heroic encounter.<br />
<br />
But let's say you are a member of a Heroic raid in Icecrown Citadel, and after killing Lord Marrowgar on Heroic you have Internet connection issues that prevent you from raiding for two nights. During those two nights, the rest of the raid kills everything. Without the Flexible Raid Lock system, you would be done with raiding Icecrown Citadel for the week. Ouch. With the Flexible Raid Lock system, you can join someone else's raid as long as they are doing Normal difficulty. This would at least give you the opportunity to earn your Justice Points for the week. If this raid attempted to switch to Heroic difficulty for Icecrown Gunship Battle with you in the raid, the raid leader would receive an error message stating that she cannot change to Heroic, because someone in the raid (i.e., you) is already locked to a different Heroic instance.<br />
<br />
All of the new Cataclysm raids will feature the Flexible Raid Lock and Dynamic Difficulty systems, and when the Cataclysm occurs the other Wrath of the Lich King raids will also have these features. It's important to note that this system doesn't affect Heroic dungeons, they will work as they always have. We look forward to feedback for this new system after 4.0.1 is released. As a reminder, Icecrown Citadel and The Ruby Sanctum are the only two raids that support the Flexible Raid Lock until the Cataclysm occurs.</div></div><hr />

Will kill a lot of the flexibility of the new system for those guilds that are currently working on heroic content only since you won't be able to swap to a 10 man version of the instance.<br />
<br />
I know it will retain the current flexibility, but just not the same flexibility that normal mode will enjoy in 4.0.1+</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DevilHeart</div><div class="date">2010-10-01, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically in case of normal mode you will not be locked to the instance but locked to the boss. You can enter another raid id which has killed the same or more bosses. If you kill another boss during the second raid you will get locked to all the bosses that are killed in that instance.<br />
<br />
Ie <br />
You kill marrowgar in raid 1. Raid disbands.<br />
You kill gunship in raid 2. You will now be locked to marrow+gunship+deathwhisper. If you fail on gunship you will not get locked to the new instance killed bosses.<br />
<br />
For Hc difficulty its different. You must complete all the heroic bosses in the same instance group. If you fail to do so you are allowed to revert back to normal and enter another raid group, but you wont be allowed to switch to heroic(unless its the same instance as before).</div></div><hr />

On that note, great changes, but it'll take a lot of people time to get used to them and understand them. I like how everything is still just 1 kill per boss per week, yet we have so many options on how to do so.<br />

I actually really wish this was the way it was implemented. I can see some minor issues with this though and how it could possibly be &quot;abused&quot; but it's not worth going into that now. Though I agree, being able to kill it multiple times but only getting badges/loot the first time would be fantastic.<br />

<br />
I completely agree. Instead of being able to view what bosses are down in a raid and whether you can go, they could have simply given each player a display of what they have downed that week and then, upon entering a raid ID that wasn't their original ID, be given a pop-up warning that says &quot;You are not eligible for loot from the following bosses in this raid ID: Marrowgar, Lady Deathwhisper&quot; as well as giving the raid leader access to a raid UI that shows each boss and a list of people who are not eligible for loot, so that people can figure out whether it is worth it to do that boss (assuming it is skippable or you can change the raid leader and use a different, further along raid save).</div></div><hr />

This new way Blizzard is going to use still means that if you try to do a 10man raid and 4 people in the group already did the first boss in a weekly pug for some dumb reason, you can only take the 6 unsaved of your people to do the first boss before the others can join. Or the 6 unsaved people are forced to skip the first boss.<br />
But by flagging that you've looted the boss, you could take that 10man group &amp; go from start, the ones who are already saved get no loot, and you can all continue your merry way.<br />
<br />
baby steps...</div></div><hr />

you can, in fact do a boss on H then the rest on reg. The heroic restrictions, i think, are so you cannot sell yourself out as a key to heroic encounters to those who have not already unlocked them (without committing yourself to that raid group for that lockout at least). If you were to join a group to help them access lootship, for example, you would not be able to raid anymore heroics that week unless it was with the same raid id.</div></div><hr />

I hate that they basically flipped off anyone doing heroics and said you're still stuck with the old rigid system, deal with it. What POSSIBLE reason is there to ignore this change for anyone raiding Heroic modes? Protip: Guilds doing Heroics have attendance issues sometimes too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My own guild has has a 25 man raid during the week and runs two 10 man groups on the weekends. One of the 10 man groups has killed LK10HC, the other is still working on it. Now we are basically going to be screwed. If we want to continue with our regular 25 man raids then it means half the guild will never be able to get a LK 10 HC kill. They will always be saved to the 25 man raid. After a lot of time and effort this leaves a lot of our guild members in an awful position. Either give up on the LK10 title altogether or bring a bunch of alts into the 25 man raid and gimp our potential for progression there.<br />

This is pretty much a lose lose situation for us. &quot;Flexible&quot; indeed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering in Cataclysm both 10man and 25 drop the same thing, are suposed to be just as hard and both permits realm firsts and such. I really don't see how 10man guilds are penalised.<br />
<br />
At the moment, yeah it sucks since you can't do bosses twice to get 10/25man loots, but honestly, WOLTK is finished, they are using ICC just to test the feature.<br />
<br />
I really don't see why people QQ about the heroic restriction either. Lets keep ICC as an example and say that a guild utterly fail at Sindragosa 25man heroic, but they killed everything else and want to work on the Lich King cause nobody else killed it on their crappy server, its to prevent that this guild, switch Sindragosa heroic to 10man and kill her with their 10 decent raiders, so they can continue their 25man progression while skipping a boss.</div></div><hr />

This would allow people to raid with whatever friends they want, whenever they want. And never HAVE to raid more than once for the sake of min/maxing progression. They're half way there. Maybe someday they'll figure it out.<br />
<br />
Except for the fact then I could then raid a 25 man raid and swap people in feed them loot. Kill marrowgarr, give loot to people. Redo instance, swap three new people in. Those three people have all the loot that drops for them. They thought of your idea and thats the issue with it. You are not as smart as you think you are.</div></div><hr />

And they could it as many times as they want.<br />
<br />
You could have a group of five &quot;awesome&quot; people in your guild, group them with five not-so-great people, and effectively run them through some bosses. You could then swap the five not-so-great people for five others, and do the exact same thing. Each time only the five &quot;new&quot; people would be able to loot. I'm guessing this is the reason this isn't implemented.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I do wish being locked out of gear/badges rather than bosses as draticus notes was something Blizzard added in. It was definitely something they mentioned doing in the past.<br />

I'ld have liked to be able to convert down to a 10 man raid in heroic but there you go. It's also going to kill my chances of getting Bane of the Fallen King in 10 man unless we kill him and we kill him soon. :(<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that the loot lists also won't be combined. So even if we can convert it down to a 10 man raid we probably won't bother since a) it will be the 10 man loot list and b) we can only get the normal version of the loot so it really will not be worth our time.<br />
<br />
On the other hand ICC raiding will soon be over and this will be an amazing change for Cata raiding (since I doubt I'll be seeing any heroic content, save dungeons, for some time :3).</div></div><hr />

I suspect that is highly unlikely. They would also have to rebalance all the ICC 10 fights to be equal difficulty with the 25 man ones which I suspect they are not going to do.</div></div><hr />

We are still talking WOTLK here bud, we know they were answered for cataclysm, but this post is saying the changes will be implemented for the last patch of WOTLK, when there still are separate 10/25 achievements, there are still separate 10/25 gear and many people do care about mounts and titles.<br />
<br />
Some guilds can only raid some of the 25 man on heroic, so of course they will want to do that, but then also later in the week go back and will raid the 10 man and get many more bosses down on heroic. With this system it seems you can only choose to do one version on heroic, and get &quot;locked out&quot; of the rest of the bosses on heroic if you have to do one normal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreadnor</div><div class="date">2010-10-01, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One reason i find the Heroic Restriction suitable is because of the implications behind Flexible Raid Lock System and Server Firsts. In Cataclysm, the achievements of Server First: SO-and-SO are on the HEROIC versions of that boss. Not only that, but the achievement is shared between both 10 man heroic version of boss X and 25 man heroic version of boss X.<br />
<br />
so if a guild does heroic bosses 25 man, then they stop at the last guy cause they cant down it, they break the raid up into 2 10 mans, but cant do the 10 man heroic mode of the remaining boss. The Heroic Restriction forces that the achievement for Server First: SO-and-SO be done within the same lockout, and not by means of any group-merging or group-breakdowns. <br />
<br />
im pretty sure this is why they are enforcing the Heroic Restriction, and their logic is sound to be. It hurts the puggers out there a little, but keeps the hardcore guilds in check so that the achievement is given properly to one, single, lockout.</div></div><hr />

I think he is wondering about RS and ICC, i know in Cata the loot for 10/25 will be the same, but like me i want to know if they are doing this with ICC and RS, or they are keeping the loot as it is but with the new Flexible Raid? most likely it look like this. Which i do think it is still a good idea, for now, because if blizzard made the loot the same for RS and ICC, what level would it be? 251 or 264? and if they take one out, what would happen to the people who have the others?</div></div><hr />

It's nice to see that Blizzard now knows that 10-mans have a far less margin of error, and that the only thing more difficult about 25-man raids than 10-mans is getting 25 players together. Look how many people can afk in ICC, look how many can die in encounters. Hell, the old strat for Saurfang was to let the first two people with marks die, you couldn't do that in 10-man off the bat. Finally 10-man guilds will get the same gear as they deserve.<br />
<br />
Plus, things are going to be far more competitive. Unless you're a top 10 guild in the world, it's more probable to have 10 great players in your guild, and then cut-off the fat. Those that weren't up to snuff and couldn't follow directions, those that afk'd mid fight in raids. Good job on this one Blizzard, no sarcasm from me. Honestly, I applaud this.</div></div><hr />

They are talking about ICC/RS loot - not Cata! We all know Cata look will be the same!<br />

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if ICC/RS10 start dropping 25man gear. Blizzard really could care less at this point since it's all going to be replaced by the end of the year. The question is if they would spend the time to program it or not. Achievements will stay separate because ugh, what a mess that would be to combine them.<br />

This change is good.. The timing is awful. This patch is hitting in a week or two, right? My guild still does 25man ICC Tues-Thurs, and 10man ICC for drakes/heroic LK on weekends.

I don't believe that is what people complaining about 10 mans are talking about. I know for me specifically, being my guild's tank, this means I will not be able to get complete my heroic 10 man achievements if I want to keep helping the guild progress in 25..</div></div><hr />

The flexible raidlock sounds like a bad idea to me. So you have killed the first 3 bosses in a bad pug, then you need to find a raid that has killed exactly those 3 bosses? How is that helpful.<br />
<br />
No, killed -at least- those bosses. As long as the bosses you have killed are dead in the raid you are trying to join, you can go in. You just can't kill the same boss twice in a week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the issue here is that they are introducting it for ICC, without any explanation, and at max a 2 weeks warning. Not only do people now have 10 and 25 man groups, but they are also working to get specific items, doing specific achievements, etc.<br />
<br />
Is 10 man difficulty going to be increased, will it drop 25 man loot now? does your 10 and 25 man achievements merge?<br />

^^ this.<br />

Why wouldn't a guild good enough to do heroics benefit from being able to split the 25-man raiding team into 2 10-man teams when they only get 20-21 signups one night? Isn't 10-man and 25-man supposed to be equally difficult? What, then, does it matter to make it behave in the same way that the normal system works?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't help people raiding heroic bosses at all with their guild. You cannot downsize from that, so if we lack people one night we cannot continue.<br />
<br />
By the time people are ready to raid heroic encounters they're usually maxed out on badge/justice point gear anyways. So being able to joined some scub pug to grabs some points on normal is crap.<br />

Sounded nice until they prevented it all working with heroics.</div></div><hr />

The new system is great for progress raids, new guilds (that can't always get 25 man together for their first few raids) and also PuGs, if people even care to do it any more. While keeping the normal heroic progression in tact.<br />
<br />
I don't know what people are talking about when they say R.I.P 10 or even 25 man or they fucked over progressive 25/10 man heroic guilds, because the system is exactly the same as it is now. You just have to choose between 10 and 25 man, without feeling forced to do both any more, isn't that GREAT? More time to do other stuff in-game, IRL or maybe play other games!<br />

No, you can join a group that has killed 6 bosses and kill the remaining six.

It also means you don't have to go slog through 11 bosses to get up to LK in 10 man ... and I dooooo mean slog.<br />
<br />
ToC was the worst ... you had to run the dam thing 4 times each week (10 norm, 10 hard, 25 normal, 25 hard) to get max loot / badges. ICC was a little better only have to run it twice (and I really liked the way they dealt with badge gear). I really like the change to a single lock out so you only have to run stuff once ... per toon. <br />
<br />
I am still going to spend just as much time raiding after the patch as I did before, the difference will be my alts will get a lot more play time and that will keep the game fresh as the encounters play a bit differently from class to class.</div></div><hr />

If you were to join a group to help them access lootship, for example, you would not be able to raid anymore heroics that week unless it was with the same raid id.<br />

<br />
I think this guy has a point here. This is going to be horrifically overcomplicated for most pugs, especially good ones that have a chance at doing some hc bosses.<br />
<br />
The idea here is good because the current system for getting locked after 1 boss is pretty terrible. With regards to the heroic rules I think the reason why it is being implemented many of you have overlooked, if we put it in the current context of Icecrown:<br />
<br />
Now lets say that LK25hc is extremely hard, and LK10hc is fairly easy in comparison. Seeing as they drop the same loot nothing would stop a 25man guild splitting the raid into 2 teams of 10 and killing LK10. The rule is basically there to stop guilds abusing badly tuned bosses which aren't equally difficult on both 10 and 25 man, and lets face it, almost all of the bosses are going to be slightly easier on one size, Blizz have given themselves an almost impossible task of balancing both.<br />
<br />
In summary: A system like this would be great for pugs, but will have no effect on a hardcore 25 man guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not.<br />
<br />
Why? cause gear progression / difficulty is still the same in WoTLK. <br />
10 Man: 200-&gt; 219-&gt; 232-&gt; 251. <br />
25 Man: 213 -&gt; 226 -&gt; 245 -&gt; 264 (roughly speaking)<br />
<br />
The tier is decided by the difficulty, not the raid size. Bliz purposely made 10 mans easier to satisfy the &quot;casual&quot; crowd (although I think that was a mistake). Now folks think 10 man = easy mode and are in for quite a shock then their Cata 10mans are actually hard.<br />
<br />
Folks think 25 mans are going to die in Cata and I think it's going to be opposite. I think 10's, if tuned properly, are going to end up more difficult for the average player then 25's. Why? cause when you make mistakes in 10, they are amplified due to there not being many peeps to cover your ass.</div></div><hr />

I always enjoyed being able to go to the 10 man verion of dungeons to do hard modes and obtain upgrades early in it's release while we try and get the 25 man on the same page. I would always feel a step ahead by obtaining upgrades in the 10 man from the hard modes because we are able to farm it sooner than 25 man.

<br />
Not allowed to join that raid because I already killed marrowgar?<br />
Am I ported out when Marrowgar is engaged?<br />
Am I allowed to &quot;fight&quot; marrowgar but not receive loot?<br />
Is Marrowgar no longer in the instance for this raid because I killed him before?<br />
Other?<br />
<br />
You cannot join a raid group that hasn't killed marrowgar, is how I'm reading it. If, however, the raid group you join has killed marrowgar and Lady D, and you do boat with them, then you are locked to Lady D and Boat. This is, of course, assuming that you killed Marrow on regular.<br />
<br />
Lets say you kill marrowgar on heroic, have disconnect issues, etc., and can't continue with that group. You then join the same raid group above a couple of days later at boat (and its a different raid ID than your original group) because you need the badges/bored/etc. They see your achievements, and say &quot;OMG, A Kingslayer, Turn on Boat for us!!!!&quot; You'll have to tell them, &quot;Sorry, no dice. I killed a heroic boss already this week with a different group.&quot; They will then say, &quot;Thanks for nothing, jerk&quot; and kick you from the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will be easier for normal modes all around. Heroic Modes will be easier as well, as you have a pool of players that were not available before ... the ones that got saved to a fail normal run. It will also be easier to fill heroic modes with people that don't care about heroics and they will join knowing they can go back to normals once you fail.<br />
<br />
Overall, it will be easier to fill raids with these changes, once you actually think about it instead of knee jerk it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;what you have 3 bosses down? sry but we killed only 2&quot;<br />
<br />
RL's with partial raids will be posting their link of progression, so anybody wanting to know, can click on the link and see. So there won't be back and forth like your assuming.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
... AND you can not invite people who did heroic bosses if you intend to kill one <br />
<br />
Yes, but only if you have downed heroic bosses and want to continue doing heroic bosses. But, it will still be easier then filling now. Why? Cause now you can't fill with ANYBODY that has killed ANY boss in ICC. After the change, all the people that killed normal bosses in ICC will be able to join your raid (as long as they are not further along).<br />
<br />
So overall the only &quot;stupid&quot; thing around here are the people posting knee jerk reaction stating things are stupid without first thinking it through, or asking questions.</div></div><hr />

I agree this should not be brought out in ICC and RS. Let us run it the way we want till Cata so that we can get the gear we want. Some guild regardless of the expansion coming out are still trying to kill HM LK 25 and I think this will just kill it.

Haven't decided about how I feel about this rest, but this change is soooooo overdue. It's gotten to the point where I won't enter an instance in a PUG until every other player is inside.

<br />
It's a great idea actually, putting aside the whole &quot;test it before cata&quot; thing. <br />
<br />
What is the biggest change this is bringing about? Time being free'd up. Today you kinda/sorta/have to run stuff twice for your main char. After the patch, you only run it once. This causes an issue where you have more time on your hands.<br />
<br />
Most of us have alts that don't get enough play time. *Ding* ... those alts are now going to get more play time. Sucks if you have a single char and extra time today cause you will have more free time in the very near future.<br />
<br />
And that is why I think this is great ... more play time for my alts. Beside the fact that I am pretty tired of running the content anyways. I counted my runs of gunship the other day on my chars ... 130+ times I have done that encounter.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I think you could turn on Heroic at that point, based upon what was posted. You join a group with 24 other people that have not downed a boss on heroic, you, as the newly appointed RL and keeper of the sacred heroic raid ID should be able to turn Heroic bosses on / off from that point forward as long as nobody else has a heroic boss id for that run.<br />
<br />
Right? at least that is how I read it. You just can't *mix* heroic boss id's. I am starting to think of it as an STD in that you can share your STD with others that don't have an STD yet, you just can't share yours with others that have their own STD :-)</div></div><hr />

Are you all wotlk kiddies who have no idea how a pre expansion patch works? Raid bosses downed after them are meaningless. They don't need to rebalance 10 man fights if they drop 264 gear because it doesn't matter. Once 4.0.1 comes out the only reason for raiding is to get better leveling gear. That is unless your guild wants to be &quot;that guy&quot; who puts in their recruitment that they downed H LK but forgets to mention it was post 4.0.1 like many guilds like to do with KJ and 3.0.</div></div><hr />

This is especially true for the more hardcore guilds.<br />
<br />
The best players could sell themselves to other guilds, especially tanks and healers. Having trouble on that final boss? Whisper the best guild on the server and see if a tank a healer would be willing to help for a few thousand gold. Or, they could form up 9 man groups and sell the last spot, running the person's fresh raid ID for them. Need a few items off the first 4 bosses? Pay a guild to run you through, all drops guaranteed to be yours.<br />
<br />
Having thought of these scenarios, I can understand why Blizzard is avoiding this.</div></div><hr />

Hypothetical:<br />
<br />
A raid is working on HM25 Sindragosa, and is extending each lockout to get more time on her. They run Fridays. On Wednesday, a handful of raid members run a 10man on regular and do not kill Sindragosa. The raid leader himself does not run any raids before Friday, and extends his prior 10/12 hard mode ID. Those ten members could still join the extended raid, right? But if they did any hard modes on their 10, or if they killed Sindragosa, they could not?</div></div><hr />

For pugs this is double-sided sword.<br />
Either it can do good, or it can harm.<br />

Harm i imagine. People kill the first boss. Wipe a couple of times on the second boss. Now instead of them committing to stay or they would be locked for the entire week, they'll just leave and find another group with 1 boss down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure how the &quot;extensions&quot; work, but if you take that part out, I believe the answer is: Yes.<br />
<br />
ie: <br />
Raid A does Icc10 10/12 on normal.<br />
Raid B does Icc25 10/12 on heroic.<br />
<br />
Raid A can join Raid B, regardless.<br />
Raid B can join Raid A, and do the last 2 bosses on normal.<br />
<br />
That is how I am reading it. <br />
<br />
I am guessing that Extended ID's will *forget* who was originally in them and just resolve for &quot;can this person join based upon this weeks ID's?&quot; and will allow your scenario to work. Just guessing on the extended though, it's really not been made clear yet.</div></div><hr />

Are they normalizing loot as well? It would only make sense considering they are locking you to both 10 and 25? It almost eliminates the desire to go to pug 10s if a persons only chance at marks is in 25 man<br />
They didn't address this here because it was addressed months ago. 10M and 25M loot will be the same. H10M and H25M will be the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the ID is created when the first boss is downed, so you weren't there for the creation of the &quot;Second&quot; ID. The RL has the ID created from the regular Marrowgar kill, and you are tagged to an id with a heroic marrowgar kill, so your heroic id trumps any other IDs you join. If your heroic ID and your RL's ID doesn't match up, then no heroic modes for the group you joined. It almost seems like there's 1 comparision points in the background for heroic modes, and a secondary comparision point for bosses.<br />
<br />
IE:<br />
<br />
Heroics: Same Raid ID as Leader Y/N -&gt; If Y, Heroic enabled, If N, no heroics modes possible<br />
<br />
Bosses Dead: Do you have More or Less of the bosses dead than the RL? -&gt; Less, you can join, More, you can't join. Make All Players' Raid Bosses Dead flags = after next boss kill (IE: The You've killed first 4 bosses, Pug has killed 6, You help pug kill PP, you've now killed 7 bosses because now your &quot;bosses killed&quot; flag matches the RL's flag, without fighting Rot/Fester yourself example in the blue posts)</div></div><hr />

Quit a bit actually and it will go up. Take 4/12 runs. Lot of runs die when X number of people bail after DBW doesn't drop. You can now take two 4/12 groups and make one 4/12 from the remnants ... and btw, that 2/12 from your example decides to get in on the 4/12 and skip those 2 bosses.<br />

How do you have access to Lich King heroic encounter? By defeating Putricide, Blood Queen and Sindragosa in heroic mode of the same size (10 or 25).<br />
<br />
That answers why they have a restriction for heroic version. On cataclysm, heroic raids can have extra bosses and events (one of the new raids will have extra lore/content if you beat it in heroic mode). So, doesn't make sense to let ppl skip hard (and necessary) bosses to get directly to the extra &quot;heroic only&quot; boss, event, etc.<br />
<br />
That also answers the achievement questions. Want Bane of the Fallen King? Deal with it in 10man heroic. Want Light of Dawn? Deal with it in 25man heroic as it should be (for now, while in Cataclsym, it will be one achievement for both).<br />
<br />
To be honest, the real deal now (since WotLK hardmodes were created) is the heroic mode, Blizz couldn't care less for normal mode. That's why they're kinda of protecting it.<br />
<br />
And no, they're not forcing you to raid only heroic ICC if you do one heroic boss. They're forcing you to only raid with that raid lock if you do one heroic boss, you can't do a raid hopping to get heroic kills here and there. You won't be able to do something like &quot;deal with Putricide and Blood Queen 25 heroic with my group, then I'll join that other raid for Sindragosa 25 heroic since my group sucks and then another one for LK 25 Heroic since the former raid sucked at him.&quot; You can bring non-saved ppl to your 25 heroic raid, but you can't get saved and join another heroic group that is ahead of your former group on their 25 heroic raid lock.<br />
<br />
And forget about DBW in Saurfang 10 ppl, don't confuse flexible raid system with new loot tables for cataclysm.<br />
<br />
The only question I have is about not getting saved... if players join a raid to help kill a specific boss... and leave the raid (and probably hearth) with, let's say, 2%, 1% boss health, do they get saved or they just helped the raid to kill the boss? LoL.</div></div><hr />

Does this mean I won't be able to finish my Glory of the Icecrown Radier (10-Player) now? Or will all of these achievements be merged?<br />
<br />
My meta was going to be completed next reset. : \<br />
<br />
Also if 10 and 25 share the same lock out, does this mean that my raid will get Light of Dawn for killing heroic LK in 10 player? Because my guild has had that one farm for some time....<br />

Stuff will most likely still be seperate in that area, but you can´t do both in one week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you will not be able to join. you have to join a run with the same amount of boss down or more, you can't join one with less bosses.<br />
<br />
example, you down 4/12 bosses (don't matter if 10/25), a pug down 4+/12 boss (don't matter if 10/25) you can join them<br />
<br />
don't work his way<br />
you down 10/12 and a pug down 4/12 and is looking for people to finish, you will not be able to join them until they down 10/12 or more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The normal version of raids will allow the casuals (yes the casuals will raid the normal version). It will give them a chance to PuG. While the heroic version is strictly for hardcore raiders, promoting the need for a guild. <br />
<br />
I don't understand the people whining about ICC loot and achievements. First you whine about how ICC has lasted too long, a huge failure on Blizzard's part. And now you whine that you didn't get enough time to kill the bosses/get the loot, also a huge failure on Blizzard's part. Make up your minds seriously. It looks like some people just need a reason to bash Blizzard for whatever they do. Yes they made mistakes in the past (or showed how retarded they are in some cases), but this is not one of them.</div></div><hr />

If you want certain bosses to not be doable on heroic without downing other bosses on heroic, that's another story (Like killing 4 wing bosses for LK heroic).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sidebar</div><div class="date">2010-10-01, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But the ID is created when the first boss is downed,so you weren't there for the creation of the &quot;Second&quot; ID. The RL has the ID created from the regular Marrowgar kill, and you are tagged to an id with a heroic marrowgar kill, so your heroic id trumps any other IDs you join.<br />
<br />
Correct, my ID (Heroic) trumps the The RL's ID (Not Heroic)<br />
<br />
<br />
If your heroic ID and your RL's ID doesn't match up, then no heroic modes for the group you joined.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what your basing this on. Let's run it down.<br />
<br />
A) You are now the RL, and you have a 25 Man Heroic ID.<br />
B) For that Heroic ID, that Boss is not Dead.<br />
C) Nobody in the raid has a Heroic ID.<br />
<br />
I don't see a problem with you setting it to Heroic at that point, provided all of the aforementioned is true. Should be that simple.<br />
<br />
Remember, the idea of this is to allow &quot;non-heroic-saved&quot; players to join your raid. There is not any real difference between going 3/12Heroic, then filling a spot with a 3/12Normal versus a 3/12Normal filling with a 3/12Heroic player.<br />
<br />
As long as the Heroic ID is not cleared, you should be able to &quot;upgrade&quot; the normal players to your heroic. Of course, if your Heroic IC was cleared, your SoL and so is the new group you joined.<br />
<br />
In the present, there was always a danger of somebody *stealing* your raid id if the group stopped for the day. In the future, you should only have to worry about somebody *stealing* your Heroic ID, as normal won't work that way anymore.<br />
<br />
Sound right?</div></div><hr />

However with it coming into ICC it does leave me with questions that i cannot ask since i can't access the american forums.<br />

1) What happens to loot: Do 10 / 25 drop the same items now?<br />
2) What about the frost wyrms: I have the 10 man but what happens with the 25 one.<br />

<br />
why the guy who had connection problems in the middle of a raid go and redo the raid but without loot for the bosses he already is locked on?<br />
<br />
because being 3/13 is virtually the same as being locked since every group starts from 0/13 and likely will go to the end<br />
<br />
sure this makes easy for the % of the wow population that hops in &quot;need one dps for X done Y wings&quot; raids but how many times you actually did that?</div></div><hr />

Loot is not changing. 10m kills will drop 10m loot still. 25m kills will drop 25m loot still.<br />
Achievements are not changing. 10m kills will give 10m achievs still. Ditto 25m.<br />
<br />
All it basically means is that you can PuG more easily, but you can't kill any ICC boss more than once in a week. Heroic modes are basically unaffected.</div></div><hr />

Who cares about gear? I want my drake :3<br />
<br />
As main tank I can't just say &quot;screw you&quot; to the rest of the guild that wants to keep trudging forward in 25 man for useless gear. This is why I find it unfair. It's going to be awesome in Cata...but not for right now :(</div></div><hr />

This is a step ahead though, giving us more flexibility. It's really not that difficult to understand if you actually read the wall of text. It actually is pretty nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this change would have rocked for VoA, would have been able to do all the optional and/or easier bosses first with no fear of being saved to a wipe on the 'good boss'.<br />
<br />
I can only wonder if the raids will be substantial enough to really call for a system like this though. 5-6 bosses isnt much, with or without trash.<br />
<br />
I guess it should ease the worry of pugging into a bad raid that wipes on the 2nd or 3rd boss.<br />
The changes may also make it more 'acceptable' for raidleaders to boot low-performers one or two bosses in.<br />
&quot;So what ? you can still finish the raid if you want... just not with us...&quot;<br />
Especially in heroic, the person booted still has the option of completing the raid on normal mode, while you replace him and continue on hardmodes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/care about you being able to freely swap raids in Normal mode, just like WotLK, normal modes will be forgotten in a matter of weeks to swap to Heroic modes, and there is where basically you'll be locked to your raid just like you're now.<br />
<br />
You just have the possibility to back up to a Normal mode raid pug if you weren't in the first 10/25..</div></div><hr />

Too bad the game doesn't revolve around you, sorry. Your 2) is a good example on how to take advantage of this. Break down into two 10 man raids. Continue to work on your achievements. If you get the raid size you need, reform into a 25 and continue on the same spot you stopped your 10 man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already have the achievements as does many others from the 25man. There are about 6-8 that do not and they are working on their drake achievements. This new system is doing nothing but limiting peoples choices. They can still implement part of this new system without sharing 10/25man lockouts.<br />
<br />
Also we are getting the people for 25man. It's just borderline. We often run 1-2 short for an hour till more are able to get online.</div></div><hr />

Yes. This change simultaneously makes things simpler, yet somehow more complicated at the same time. The link feature will be useful, but I can see a lot of people not understanding it.</div></div><hr />

The simple version of this would be &quot;Each player can only loot each boss once per week regardless of raid size or difficulty.&quot; That is the solution I've been suggesting since day 1. This would allow people to raid with whatever friends they want, whenever they want. And never HAVE to raid more than once for the sake of min/maxing progression. They're half way there. Maybe someday they'll figure it out.<br />

It's a useless idea, because that would mean a good group could farm a boss endlessly, selling the 10th spot and all loot to baddies. Do we want that?</div></div><hr />

Do we want that? <br />
<br />
Why? There's ways to avoid that. My question specifically is, how will this Flexible Raid System work when you want to join a raid that's doing a boss you've already done that week. Wouldn't you be able to? I don't think we are - correct me if wrong. The way to fix this is to indeed allow a player to do a boss more times a week without it having drop loot for you, if, and only if, the group leader's raid you joined does not have the same raid ID as yours (even if that actual ID becomes invisible to players), and if there are no more than 3 out of 10 players or 7 out of 25 players (random numbers are completely random) in that same group with the same raid ID as yours. In this case your raid log would still say, for example, &quot;Saurfang killed&quot;, even though the pug you just joined is still at gunship. You'd do gunship and saurfang again but receive no loot or points from it, but then be able to proceed to fester with that pug.<br />
<br />
That said, guilds have always sold spots and they will continue to do so. Do you honestly think good guilds right now are still after the loot? Of course not, they're taking advantage of the current status of WOW and the possible hibernating status of their guild and just selling spots (and thus heroic loot). I know on my old server, when WOTLK was released, our server's top guild was selling undying runs and the like, too.</div></div><hr />

well thats a brilliant idea.... NOT - again, people have clarified and explained that with Cata and the loot tables being the same, fine, no problem - but with the remaining 2-3-4 months left for ICC, you are now being forced into running either 10 or 25, normal or heroic as you cant do both on the same toon, and I agree - it sucks - love it for Cata, hate it for ICC</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. The Blizzard post and the replies following it simply prove (yet again) that the average person playing WoW and using these forums is an idiot. At least 90% of the questions people asked about the new system are answered in the original post. I wonder how some people survive in the world when just a handful of paragraphs becomes &quot;tl;dr&quot; for them. Can you people read a newspaper? How about an instruction manual, book or magazine article? I gather from some of these responses that unless information comes in pictogram form you'll never be able to comprehend it. You're going to make someone rich someday.<br />
<br />
Quoting the original text here: &quot;While players can freely move between raids of different sizes in normal difficulty, there are some additional rules for Heroic difficulty. If a 10- or 25-player raid defeats a boss on Heroic difficulty, then those players may now only raid additional Heroic encounters with that specific raid. If your Heroic 25-player raid defeats the first four bosses of Icecrown Citadel on Heroic, then they may not split up into two 10-player raids and continue to fight in Heroic difficulty. You may also not join someone else's raid if they have defeated a Heroic encounter.<br />
<br />
But let's say you are a member of a Heroic raid in Icecrown Citadel, and after killing Lord Marrowgar on Heroic you have Internet connection issues that prevent you from raiding for two nights. During those two nights, the rest of the raid kills everything. Without the Flexible Raid Lock system, you would be done with raiding Icecrown Citadel for the week. Ouch. With the Flexible Raid Lock system, you can join someone else's raid as long as they are doing Normal difficulty. This would at least give you the opportunity to earn your Justice Points for the week. If this raid attempted to switch to Heroic difficulty for Icecrown Gunship Battle with you in the raid, the raid leader would receive an error message stating that she cannot change to Heroic, because someone in the raid (i.e., you) is already locked to a different Heroic instance.&quot;<br />
<br />
OT, I am sure there are many guilds out there currently who can only do partial ICC25 hard modes but are able to clear more ICC10 HMs with their most capable 10 players. Now they won't be able to. Instead of running both 25m and 10m instances on the same toon in a given week, they'll be &quot;forced&quot; to play two mains; a 10 man main and a different 25 man main. I suspect many guilds will split becoming distinctly &quot;10 man&quot; or &quot;25 man&quot; guilds with less middle ground. And I predict there's going to be 1001 different 10 man guilds on most servers. On the bright side for some, hard modes will be that much more exclusive so the hard mode raiders will have more to justify their e-peen stroking. I'd still like to hear Blizz's thinking behind the decision to restrict hard mode flexibility though. That choice more than anything will be the death of 25 man raiding.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eviscerate</div><div class="date">2010-10-01, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nothing has really changed.<br />
<br />
If you are 2/12 in 10 man and joined an 8/12 in 10 or 25 man, you would still be saved after defeating the 9th boss. You still cannot defeat the bosses you skipped for you will be locked to it as well. It's not like each boss have their own lockouts, right? I think most people here doesn't know how to read or don't have any reading comprehension ability.<br />
<br />
The only thing that changed here is that<br />
a) You won't get saved just by zoning in.<br />
b) You can continue your progress by alternating 10 and 25 man runs.<br />
c) You can still run Normal after being saved to a Heroic run.<br />
d) You can join someone else's run as long as you are on the same boss or higher.<br />
<br />
That's it. Stop complicating things noobs.<br />
<br />
Nothing has really changed here, aside from the changes they made for cata (Both raid sizes have same lockouts, same loots, etc)</div></div><hr />
