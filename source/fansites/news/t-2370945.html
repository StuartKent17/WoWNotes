The development of World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth is well underway, and we want to share some insights into our philosophies and approach to class design for the expansion. While the launch of Legion brought lots of change to all of Warcraft’s classes, Battle for Azeroth will more closely resemble the example set by Legion’s patch content: targeted iteration based on player feedback and data.<br />
<br />
The intro cinematic of Battle for Azeroth revealed at BlizzCon 2017 has an underlying theme that resonates deeply with the class design team: “Remember what makes us strong.” With that in mind, our goals for the next expansion are to promote what makes each class unique, focus on making group gameplay the best that it can be, and continue our efforts to improve combat visuals and effects. While we believe some specializations will need substantial iteration to achieve these goals, others will not, and our target is greater stability across the board.<br />
<br />
Class Uniqueness and Utility<br />
One area we’re trying to focus on across all classes is to better emphasize what makes each class unique and provide greater distinction among their various capabilities, especially when it comes to utility—tools that fall outside of core role functions like damage, healing, or mitigation. Part of what makes you feel excitement and pride in your class is pulling off a heroic moment and feeling the appreciation of your group when individually contributing to a shared success. That feeling is eroded when so many classes bring similar abilities, and you feel you’re rarely providing something distinctive. More differentiation in this area will create situations where another class can do something that you can’t, but you will similarly bring tools to the table that your allies lack.<br />
<br />
That contrast causes members of a team to be more dependent on each other to succeed, and encourages different group compositions to approach encounters in different ways.<br />
<br />
Pursuing this goal will likely involve adding some new abilities (or re-adding previously removed abilities) to give classes a more unique signature where needed. It will also likely involve reining in the availability of certain utility types, especially those that are so widespread that they rarely provide meaningful contrast between classes. As a notable example, Area of Effect (AoE) stuns, some of most powerful utility that exists, are so abundant that most groups have at least one or two. As a result, decision-making around that tool is often less about when it would be best used, and more about avoiding overlap with other AoE stuns. Not only does this sometimes drown out the importance of other crowd control in dungeons, but it means that a class bringing an AoE stun to a group is not the major strategy-defining asset that it should be. Our goal is that whatever powerful kind of utility a class brings, it’s something that group will be happy to have added to their toolbox as they approach a challenge.<br />
<br />
The goal of contrast between the abilities of different specializations is not limited to utility. We’re also looking at different specializations’ strengths and weaknesses in their “main role”—damage dealing (or DPS), healing, or tanking—and making sure everyone has something to get excited about and an opportunity to shine. Some DPS specializations are “bursty,” doing fast damage; some live for attrition, wearing away their target. Some specializations prefer to isolate and drill into a single threat, while others revel in blowing up huge packs of monsters. Much of this plays out naturally due to the varying sets of damaging abilities, but we are working more intently than in the past to ensure an appropriate variety and spread of DPS strengths and weaknesses. Likewise, healers and tanks should have a bit more identity through their unique healing and mitigation profiles.<br />
<br />
Another part of this approach involves working with our content design teams to collaborate on a world where quests, dungeons, and raids create opportunities for all different types of class strengths to shine. If we’re arming classes with distinct tools that provide powerful answers to different situations, it’s important that the game’s content provides a broad array of challenges that play into those different tools.<br />
<br />
Talent System Refinements<br />
The overall talent system will remain largely unchanged, but we will be refining our approach. One of the major challenges in setting up talent rows is that they serve two conflicting desires: choices within a row should be meaningfully varied, but also should not feel like they are simply a test of which is best in a particular setting. <br />
<br />
If a row has three similar area-damage talents, your decision can feel like it boils down to a complex math problem. If a row mixes area-damage and single-target talents, you’ll likely feel you should change talents to suit the content you’re doing, which also rarely feels like a choice. The most successful talent rows are those with options that have a generally consistent role in your toolkit, but have very different delivery and mechanics, allowing players to thoughtfully customize their identity and complexity.<br />
<br />
One other lesson we’ve already begun implementing in Legion patches is being careful with the effect that talents have on “pacing”—how frequently you get to press your buttons, and how often you generate resources and cooldowns. Of course, many talents affect the pacing of a rotation, and this will continue to be the case, as these are some of the talents with the most noticeable and fun feel to them. But if you have access to multiple talents that slow down or speed up your rotation, players can end up outside the bounds of what feels good to play (for example, by being resource starved or flooded). As we review talents going forward, we will try to avoid this by having strong resource-generating talents compete with each other, and better limiting the pacing change allowable from any single talent.<br />
<br />
Artifacts Here and Gone<br />
One particular challenge for the class design team throughout Legion was handling the introduction and eventual removal of Artifacts. The idea was exciting: design a large set of bonuses with the intention that they would be contained within an expansion, allowing us to make them flashier, more complex, and more numerous than we’d been able to in a specialization’s permanent set of core abilities. But the process of parting with Artifacts produces a complex set of decisions about how to adjust the base classes to play well in their absence.<br />
<br />
The largest issue is where the pacing of a spec’s rotation was heavily affected by Artifacts. In that case, removing the Artifact may result in a rotation that’s too slow, or has too much open time where the core buttons aren’t available. In the process of reviewing and updating each specialization for Battle for Azeroth, we want to make sure all of them are paced appropriately after the removal of Artifacts. In some cases, we may do things like increase resource generation or reduce cooldowns to fill in some of the newly opened space.<br />
<br />
For traits that go beyond simple numerical changes and have their own identity—such as active abilities or the powerful and noticeable procs—we are on the lookout across all specs for a small selection of traits that are worth turning into permanent parts of a class. The bar is high for a trait to become permanent. It’s an intended part of the experience of a system like Artifacts that the bonuses are layered on top of the core functionality of your class. You get to explore those bonuses thoroughly, but eventually move on from them. That leaves space in the permanent classes for new special bonuses from other systems in the future, as we’ll soon be exploring with Azerite Armor. That said, various specs will likely see one or two familiar traits from Artifacts showing up in their talent trees in Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
These are the broad philosophies that are guiding our design in Battle for Azeroth, and we were deliberately light on sharing specific examples of change, which are still in a state of flux at this stage. We welcome a community discussion on the principles we’ve outlined, and look forward to delving into detailed and specific changes as we move forward with our beta testing in the near future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I would like to see artifact traits baked into talent trees. Artifact weapons are really just talent trees with their make up on.<br />
<br />
They could keep the current Talents (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 100) and throw the Artifact traits in between the big ones. So it would go:<br />
<br />
Talents unlock at level 10.<br />
Level 10-14: You get 1 &quot;minor talent points&quot; per level to put into the first tier of minor talents. (The first few artifact traits). It would only be 5 talents total, so you could acquire them all, like Artifact traits currently work. This would make balancing easier at end game because you'd get every talent like you do with artifact traits.<br />
Level 15: You get to choose between one of the 3 &quot;major&quot; talents. (Current Live talents).<br />
Level 16-29: Repeat with the &quot;minor talent points&quot;.<br />
Etc etc<br />
<br />
That way, we could keep Artifact traits, you still get all of the &quot;minor talents&quot; like you get all of the Artifact traits, and it adds something back to the game. Plus it would make leveling less atrocious. It would be awesome to get something like Share in the Light (Casting Power Word: Shield on a target other than yourself also shields you for 15% as much) at level 30 something.<br />

&quot;Our purring was a shit and we may do better - we hope, also talents provide very little choice but we are to lazy to make our talent tree system interesting, so we will put similar talents into one row, because our metrics show, these talents rows are the most diverse&quot;</div></div><hr />

Most of what they said doesn't excite me to look forward to anything, it's just broad philosophies that most of us already have heard a thousand times over. <br />
<br />
I would've liked to hear stuff like:<br />
• Their thoughts on how Survival Hunter played out - I feel like in the community it's viewed largely as a failure<br />
• What specific utility abilities they need to bring back - IE Smoke Bomb. And also how they view Talents vs PVP talents. Seems like a lot of utility moved to PVP trees, and that hollowed out PVE utility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My biggest concern though is if they will actually act on and read feedback given during Alpha and Beta. There was so much feedback given in Legion testing and so little communication that happened. SO many issues and concerns that were ignored. <br />
Guess we will have to wait and see what happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true at all. Read.<br />
<br />
They’ve stated multiple times they went too far with the pruning and throughout this statement they are reiterating the fact they want to add more abilities back and continue to try to make classes unique. They understand some feel empty and want to add more back. <br />
<br />
I know you’re negative about damn near everything but it’s quite clear they want to find a happy medium After the Prune vs Before the Prune.</div></div><hr />

Same load of BS they spout in advance of every expac, then alpha/beta drops and they find out that all of it won't work and we will end up with something worse then intended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Terrible approach. Sad negative people will tell you not to say anything but don’t listen. Just be loud. <br />
<br />
I understand a few betas in the past (like legions) had a lot of Developer vs Player interactions (ret Paladins and holy wrath is a good example) but they’ll never do anything at all if they don’t have feedback. Don’t listen to idiots, keep providing feedback and lobby for abilities to come back if you feel they should.<br />
<br />
Do all of that and hope we don’t get another scenario like Tom chilton yelling at players saying Holy Wrath is fun and good and we have to like it because he’s not going to remove it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
'Pursuing this goal will likely involve adding some new abilities (or re-adding previously removed abilities) to give classes a more unique signature where needed.'<br />
<br />
Good idea, getting rid of some stuns in favour of more interesting utility could be outright better for the game.<br />
<br />
For example: I'd love to see the return of Intervene, Shattering Throw, Piercing Howl (Arms), Spell Reflect (Mass Reflect even) and Charge Stun as BASELINE abilities/utility for Warriors and getting rid of Stormbolt, Shockwave, War Banner. It's totally okay for some classes to not have direct single target stuns.<br />
<br />
Also consider making Disarm a baseline ability rather then a PvP talent across all classes that traditionally had access to it.<br />
<br />
More engaging and complex gameplay for melee DPS in general, increasing skill ceiling to be apply pressure as a melee, more wiggle room for healers. Not alot of healers in pvp in general because they don't enjoy getting tunneled by brain-dead melee.. Gap between average melee player and good melee player getting smaller and smaller, need to extend that.</div></div><hr />

One of the things that I loved about Shadow Priests in BC, as both the player playing a Priest, but also as a healer/mana user, was their combined heal/mana &quot;HoT&quot; from Vampiric Embrace and Vampiric Touch.

MoP was good, but pales in comparison to the likes of Wrath and even early cata, but I still enjoyed it.<br />

Not happening. They've already said that they are committed to the Melee Hunter spec and good on them.<br />

I actually enjoy Survival personally. And played right it can be pretty bloody strong in raids and is absolutely disgusting in PvP.</div></div><hr />

Where does it say that though?<br />
I was really exited when I saw this. Class design is one of the most important parts of WoW (for me at least) but that text could mean just about anything.<br />
When you look up vague in a dictionary I would not be surprised to find a link to this very text.</div></div><hr />

<br />
cata class design in general was amazing.. i think if you take it for a start and try to improve it by implementing something from wrath/mop that would be amazing<br />
<br />
ofc some things i like about wrath way more.. but thats more of a game design than class design.. aka all healers having dispel etc.<br />
<br />
back in the days we had all the abilities baseline outside of talented ones as EVERY SPEC yet classes/specs still felt super unique.. now its bland as shit</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">exochaft</div><div class="date">2018-01-24, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see a big warning flag when they discuss class uniqueness and utility, specifically when they mention many classes bringing the same sort of utility and making them more unique to a specific class and/or spec in BfA. The reason they flooded the abilities across multiple classes/specs is because they wanted to get away from &quot;needing&quot; to bring a specific class/spec at the expense of everything else, however this appears to be a complete reversal of course.<br />
<br />
Here's the rub: I think they're focusing too much on making abilities/CCs/etc. unique to specific classes/specs and not paying enough attention to how necessary said abilities actually are. Why are AoE stuns so big and desired? They even admit it, AoE stuns are one of the strongest utilities in the game for most, if not all, content. Blizz creates a scenario where some unique abilities are so much more powerful than others, and suddenly everyone &quot;needs&quot; that specific class/spec versus having a wider spectrum of choices. Even with these abilities supposed being spread out, there's still exclusion of people that do not bring these abilities currently. If nothing else changes besides the abilities becoming rarer without the need for said abilities being reduced, player exclusion will likely go up. From my perspective over the course of many changes throughout the years, it has become evident of the personnel turnover for WoW as many lessons learned of the past suddenly are forgotten and mistakes are repeated again.</div></div><hr />

Last PTR, lot's of people complained about the older raids being too hard. They ended up fixing it AFTER PTR when it was already reported...<br />
<br />
During legion beta, I did a ton of feedback for enh. They barely did anything during beta, did some good changes, then reverted them back, etc. Most of the issues was with ressource generation. Fast forward once everyone is 110, oh NOW we are making WF 20% instead of 5% and NOW we are making boulderfist baseline (and just making it rockbiter actually). How many times did I get &quot;Enh is fine, shut up&quot; or &quot;They are going to fix it before release&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sure now it's fine, but my god, they took a long time to fix it.<br />

Hopefully they will understand now that we hadn't finally got FT to be passive for no reasons and give us a fun ability instead of that. A lot of their mistakes in legion did feel like they had absolutely no clue of the spec's history.</div></div><hr />

Legion Beta is the first time where I've largely felt my feedback was ignored, yeah. I railed so hard against the simplistic '3 core buttons' BM spec and the closest I got to feedback on that was one of the blues basically asking 'why does more than 3 buttons matter to you?'<br />

This has always been their problem. The Brewmaster fiasco pretty much convinced me that they tunnel vision way too hard and PTR's are really more about PR than anything else, given how beta invites went out. The other half of their problem is they rarely feel sincere in their responses. People can be polite and show why their math isn't adding up -- but they'll just be blown off. It's only when people throw a temper tantrum do Blue's respond. That's the only way they've chosen to communicate. Then the Blue's complain about &quot;attitude problems&quot;. Nah, brah, you missed that boat. They've been incredibly poor with communicating for quite some time when it comes to PTR and Beta stuff.<br />
<br />
Similar to how there is always one quest bug that lets you power level stupidly fast in every expansion that doesn't go fixed but is highly reported. Every. Single. Time. Then they'll act like it's something wholly unknown to them when people (ab)use it. Like brah -- it was on Reddit for weeks, it was on every major forum. You don't get to claim that level of ignorance.</div></div><hr />

When you look up vague in a dictionary I would not be surprised to find a link to this very text.<br />

It’s vague in a sense that they’re still working through ideas and all they’re doing is letting us know they’re train of thought. We don’t even have access to beta yet. <br />
<br />
However, if you pair this statement which provides us with their line of thinking going into BFA and what they want to do with classes (eg. bring back specific class abilities and focus on making classes stand out) with their other statements of wanting to bring back class abilities and taking the prune too far you get exactly what they’re going for, which would be adding back abilities that felt unique to specs but got pruned. <br />
<br />
It’s our job to advocate for our class and spec. If you have an ability in mind that was unique to your class and you think it would be nice to have back then lobby for it. Based on everything here they’re mindset clearly shows that’s their goal.</div></div><hr />

We had 2 really shitty betas (legion and Cata) where the developers argued with players constantly and turned out to be wrong.

<br />
The stuff they bring back can be improved though. If exorcism came back it doesn’t necessarily have to be the exact same thing, it can have some cool new things added to it. <br />
<br />
I play Holy/ret currently, ret has hardly any RNG involved which makes it fun for me. I agree with MoP class design for the most part. Some classes/specs were very fucking boring though (ret pally just to name one) however there was a lot less RNG in the rotations. <br />
<br />
Holy pally was fun, enhance and ele Sham were fun, lock was fun, survival hunter was fun. Those were the classes I played and I enjoyed them all but others were boring. I know arms/fury was very fun as well.<br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe by adding back abilities, rotations will be more MoP-like. MoP did have a good amount of RNG but there were a lot of abilities that helped make the RNG feel less like RNG if that makes sense. There were other things to use if your “RNG” didn’t favor you.<br />
<br />
In BFA we are getting a lot less RNG. 3 main slots can’t titanforge, no random legendaries, etc. Will see what the classes look like when beta opens up and provide feedback from there.</div></div><hr />

Most of what they said doesn't excite me to look forward to anything, it's just broad philosophies that most of us already have heard a thousand times over. <br />
<br />
I would've liked to hear stuff like:<br />
• Their thoughts on how Survival Hunter played out - I feel like in the community it's viewed largely as a failure<br />
• What specific utility abilities they need to bring back - IE Smoke Bomb. And also how they view Talents vs PVP talents. Seems like a lot of utility moved to PVP trees, and that hollowed out PVE utility.<br />
<br />
Funny thing about survival is that most of the people base their opinions on what they hear. Reading the forums I thought survival was really hard and complicated spec to play. Then I had to do the survival artifact challenge and I actually found survival fun spec to play. Ok if you play wow with default UI and dont want to optimize your gameplay at all then I would understand how survival can come up as difficult spec.But couple weak auras to show buff durations and its actually not that hard. Its kinda like arcane mage with burst and non burst phases with small duration between them. The only actually clunky thing about the spec is trap usage since the way traps work. There is no easy way to use it even with @cursor macros.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. <br />
<br />
Also, if they were going to insist on fundamentally changing Survival, it should have been to give Hunters a new ROLE (Tanking). Instead it just gave Hunters another DPS spec that I cannot remember anybody actively clamoring for. (Hunter Tank spec = polearm wielding hunter who rides his pet bear/boar/ostritch/crab/whatever into battle like a mounted knight).<br />
<br />
I would like to see Shadowpriests get their support abilities back. Heck, I'd like to see a viable SUPPORT role make the trinity a quadrinity. That's a pipe dream, though.</div></div><hr />

A lot of the problem is people often the same ones ask for diametrically opposed things without blinking an eye. So you get people complaining about the new level scaling being to slow and the refer a friend getting nerfed xp wise but in a different thread go off how amazing the vanilla server will be for the true leveling experience. It is no wonder with stuff like that devs sometimes throw up their hands and just have to make a choice one way or the other on their own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of SVs ranged stuff was baked into MM and BM. MM has Lock and Load as well as Black Arrow for example.<br />
<br />
You still have two perfectly playable, easy and strong specs there to play.<br />
<br />
I won't deny a minority like Survival but I'd rather them improve the spec more than just give up and go back to it being ranged. I like having that choice in if I want to be a Melee or Ranged Hunter.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER. I wouldn't mind if it went back to a Ranged spec. I like both playstyles of the Hunter class.</div></div><hr />

They already said that the &quot;bring the player not the class&quot; was no longer a thing when they did the pruning.<br />

Also artifacts are going away and most talents will be made similar to each other so they aren't perchance too powerful.<br />

If you're going to keep voidforms for Spriest, please... do something about the insanity decay rate when/if Void Torrent is taken out. The class will simply not work without its function as is.<br />
<br />
I have a better idea - please remove voidform altogether, or I can guarantee most shadow priests will reroll.<br />
<br />
Losing 10 seconds of damage because someone moved a sleep canister next to you at Imonar is mildly annoying. Losing that AND the torrent + mindbender sync, doing tank-level damage until the rotation ramps up again 40/60 seconds later, is godawful class design and infuriating. We're also mass declined and blamed for poor performance in high (20 and above) M+ keys, because the conditions that make the spec shine simply don't exist there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure if you are serious, but I actually agree.<br />
<br />
Paladins and auras have been a thing since the RTS and while Holy pally did get some aura love in Legion, they need to bring it back for Ret and Prot.<br />
<br />
The Ret toolkit in MoP was awesome and aside from Inquisition the rotation was pretty good too (though I really love the fast bursty rotation that Crusade gives us now). I miss abilities like Righteous Fury and Divine Protection (for dungeon and oh shit tanking) and Hammer of Wrath (because warrior fantasy is mashing one button).<br />
<br />
I would even love to see some classic spells come back in some form, like Divine Intervention, and a way for Ret to include healing in their rotation (like the insta-cast Flash of Light procs we had until Legion) or Prot's Hand of Protector heal.<br />
<br />
I know everyone these days just worries about meters and logs and parses, but it would be cool if hybrid classes COULD ACTUALLY BE HYBRID. A Ret pally should be able to off-tank or off-heal for a very short time if needed.</div></div><hr />

Prune away abilities and destroy classes, wait a couple years, talk about giving back old abilities as a &quot;new&quot; addition. What a crock of shit.<br />
<br />
They need to revert the prunes and give every class back their removed abilities.<br />
<br />
Mages especially need to be given back baseline across all specs -- Ice Lance, Fire Blast, Deep Freeze, Arcane Explosion, Blizzard, Decurse, Shatter passive, Cone of Cold, Mirror Image, Arcane Intellect, and ALL Mage Armors.<br />
<br />
Other abilities such as Mana Bubble, Blazing Speed, and Alter Time (/w snapshotting) need to come back as well, potentially as talent options.<br />
<br />
For Fire Mage specifically, they need to get rid of Rune of Power (clunky, antithesis of how fights are now designed), Blazing Soul (useless, too weak), Controlled Burn (RNG is no fun, especially when Fire is already all RNG), Unstable Magic (useless, too weak), and Cinderstorm (clunky, varying effectiveness, sporadic range, aggro risk) to make room. <br />
<br />
Also, both Flame On and Phoenix Flames both need to become baseline and baked into Fire Mage. Flame On is an auto take because of how seemlessly it fills out our rotation. The same can be said for Phoenix Flames.<br />
<br />
As an aside, glyphs need to be expanded tenfold. We should have all sorts of cosmetic options with glyphs, as well as the option to alter abilities how we see fit. Give us back all the WoD glyphs and add way more cosmetic ones so that we can actually do as you say, &quot;allowing players to thoughtfully customize their identity and complexity.&quot; Give us our complexity and identity back.</div></div><hr />

But even the greatest sounding philosophy would still not amount to much in actually if certain things are not met. For example, you can diversify specs and provide opportunities for different dps roles all you want, but if the single target dps of all dps specs is not within 5% of each other, then its a fail in the eyes of many players.<br />
<br />
The only thing that would have gotten me excited about this design overview is if they would have flat out said &quot;We realize that doing damage to the actual boss is one of the more important parts of the raid, and single target damage is one of the main ways a lot of players compete with each other. With that in mind, our goal is to have all dps specs be equal in single target damage, and then layer on the diversity by providing both unique utility and secondary roles that each spec can differentiate itself by; such as aoe, 2-3 target cleave, priority target burst, etc...&quot;</div></div><hr />

For example, certain m+ dungeons or raid encounters requiring a certain setup or number of classes, etc.<br />
Not really opposed, but it seems like Blizz went to far in one direction over the years and are now trying to reset that philosophy.</div></div><hr />

Also... yeah. It took you this long to realize that having a spec/class that's resource starved at times isn't fun? Did your people play Havoc at all? Did they play it without AotHG for ANY amount of time? I've got a strong feeling that I'd be better off rerolling before BFA than trusting that you'll figure out how you want the spec to actually play AND to do it in a way that feels good to play.</div></div><hr />

I meant something like crafting would scale to the endgame too. PvP gearing, or some solo/small group content (These islands may be it). Basically any sort of content, which can reward you end-game gear without actually forcing everyone to raiding/mythic dungeons. Something, where different specialization could be more useful in some other aspects of the game. <br />
<br />
Because if they really want make classes more unique (which is fantastic), it means that these hardcore groups will just bench some classes even more, just because their utility is not perfectly suited for certain raids. And if Mythic and Raiding is only source of end-game top rewards, discussion about balance is always only about, and ONLY about, how they perform in raids. <br />
<br />
Maybe it is okay, if not everyone can be top dog in raids, as long as they can be top dogs somewhere else and be rewarded for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand a few betas in the past (like legions) had a lot of Developer vs Player interactions (ret Paladins and holy wrath is a good example) but they’ll never do anything at all if they don’t have feedback. Don’t listen to idiots, keep providing feedback and lobby for abilities to come back if you feel they should.<br />
<br />
Do all of that and hope we don’t get another scenario like Tom chilton yelling at players saying Holy Wrath is fun and good and we have to like it because he’s not going to remove it.<br />

<br />
No but they obviously have eyes. They can read. Regardless of what you think or what I think feedback is still important and changes have occurred due to player feedback in the past and very recently. Many amazing changes have been brought to the game due to feedback. <br />
<br />
So, while the legion beta was very rough in terms of the developers listening to feedback that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t provide it. If you care, you provide it. If not, then continue burying useful posts with useless shitposts (not you specifically).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marrilaife</div><div class="date">2018-01-24, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I meant something like crafting would scale to the endgame too.

I do hope they look back into fixing it, true. But all I know is from what people say, as I don't pvp. <br />
<br />
Now solo / crafting your way to top gear is a problem. Because we already know from the experience if Blizzard offers people the anti-social way they will majorly take it, leaving small minority still interested in group content, but these people will have it extremely hard to find groups as most people will switch over to solo avenues. So generally unless they decide &quot;WOW is no longer an MMO, we don't care to encourage grouping&quot; this won't happen. And this is just a philosophy decision. Many people prefer to play solo, many people insist MMO needs to revolve around grouped experience. Hard to satisfy both. More like impossible. The only thing remaining is tradition - if WOW was already a group-oriented game in it's end game core, keeping it is less problematic than switching it 180 degrees. <br />
<br />
There's also another issue, namely how long people will stay subbed - the social bonds was one way of having some people subbed even after they completed majority of the content they cared about. Look at SWTOR - they changed the experience from multiplayer-oriented to solo-player oriented (more solo story questing etc.) and the player count went down to the point they had to merge servers again. It was their deliberate decision to launch expansion with just questing and no new dungeons / raids just upscaled old ones. I don't think it went so hot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I understand there is group which actually love raiding as the main (only?) source of real end game gear but if anything, wow lost MMO feel, when they focused on this aspect too much.<br />
<br />
Crafting example: You had to get some rare materials around the world. Some from raiding, some from world drops sometimes from farming reputation. Crafting itself was costly AF and in some cases, it was even BoP. For many people, it was still easier to raid or doing end-game dungeons than commit so much time to craft that awesome piece of gear and do it all over again for another piece, but there was still group of people, which prefer to play more solo or small group content and they had opportunity to get that awesome gear.<br />
<br />
Same for any sort of other end-game activities. It can be done. In fact, some mmos did this successfully.<br />
<br />
I believe that too much focus on raiding hurt quality of WoW in the end and also refocused discussion of players just into one single thing - &quot;how much deepz i can do?&quot;. And you can see what happen to class design thanks to it over the years. <br />
<br />
Also, I am not sure if putting some end-game gear to other activities will demotivate people from raiding or group content overall. Proper raiding is still extremely rare, people are raiding via LFR mostly - and I don't think there is anything worth calling &quot;group content&quot;.<br />
<br />
If they would create more small group content, which is challenging and rewarding, but is not accessible via automatic lfg tools, I think more people would be willing to communicate with each other and play in groups.<br />
<br />
They tried this already few times, but they always made it too casual with not big rewards. Mythic+ was step in the right direction. Now widen this sort of philosophy into some other aspects of the game and maybe..just maybe, People won't cry so much they are not best raid dps class as long as their classes will do exceptionally well in some other activities.</div></div><hr />

Indeed we can.<br />
<br />
I hope developers would take a look at how classes used to be decade ago. If they want classes to be more than about which one does more dps, they should take a look at what made balance good (though not perfect) in BC, how combat was slow yet more enjoyable than it is today.<br />
<br />
Its not fun when combat relies on developing reflexes for fast button mashing. Today's WoW combat is just that - reflex based button mashing. Its either refreshing multiple dots with different duration, watching procs, or just doing perfect 1-2-3,1-2-4,1-2-3 rotation while watching those dots/procs. Dull, boring, more arcade style than MMORPG.<br />
<br />
Good old shadow priest from BC is great example of that. 2 dots, 2 other abilities and that's it. Everything else are situational utilities. Easy to learn, game was more focused on using right raid utilities at right time than dull button mashing.<br />
<br />
Smaller rotations, less procs, slower game play, more utilities -&gt; better MMORPG game play that people used to love -&gt; win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm more concerned because Blizzard seems to be overlooking WHY some of those utilities and traits are so important. When you design pretty much all raid content around being multitarget fests, it's no wonder multidotters have been reigning supreme overall since fucking Cataclysm. The design, and most of the current affixes, for mythic keystones encourage stun stacking.<br />

When you design pretty much all raid content around being multitarget fests, it's no wonder multidotters have been reigning supreme overall since fucking Cataclysm. The design, and most of the current affixes, for mythic keystones encourage stun stacking.<br />

The reason they flooded the abilities across multiple classes/specs is because they wanted to get away from &quot;needing&quot; to bring a specific class/spec at the expense of everything else, however this appears to be a complete reversal of course.<br />
<br />
Here's the rub: I think they're focusing too much on making abilities/CCs/etc. unique to specific classes/specs and not paying enough attention to how necessary said abilities actually are. Why are AoE stuns so big and desired? They even admit it, AoE stuns are one of the strongest utilities in the game for most, if not all, content. Blizz creates a scenario where some unique abilities are so much more powerful than others, and suddenly everyone &quot;needs&quot; that specific class/spec versus having a wider spectrum of choices. Even with these abilities supposed being spread out, there's still exclusion of people that do not bring these abilities currently. If nothing else changes besides the abilities becoming rarer without the need for said abilities being reduced, player exclusion will likely go up. From my perspective over the course of many changes throughout the years, it has become evident of the personnel turnover for WoW as many lessons learned of the past suddenly are forgotten and mistakes are repeated again.<br />
<br />
There’s a difference between having DPS hybrids (Monk, Pala, DH, Priest, Druid and Shaman) bring more than just brute force. The draw to playing a pure dps class (2 or more options in same dps role, ranged or melee) is that you have multiple choices to play for different situations. A hybrid dps can’t do that so why play one? The reason I always play hybrids or supports type characters/classes is because I find it more fun to make a split second difference with a snap heal, cooldown or other utility. The max DPS game, to me, is boring as hell.<br />
WoD and Legion removed everything that made specs and classes have flavor, all for nothing!<br />

<br />
That’s just for min/maxing though and if you’re at that point then having people able to play their entire class, not just one spec, should be a given. I’ve Tanked and Healed in the same raid tier in MoP and WoD, both as Pala and Druid even though I mained DPS.</div></div><hr />

A lot of class fantasy was actually pruned along with mechanics that players loved from their spec, not just abilities. New outlaw is a joke, can't even play killing spree anymore. Deep insight was good design and fun when you got red buff to blow shit up, it felt very rewarding. Ret pally is just a garbage arms war now with no mobility so they need some fixing too. Bring back exorcism, long arm of the law,empancipate, and remove that trash divine steed.<br />

<br />
While I totally get the desire to have unique class identities with strongly defined strengths and weaknesses, this runs into some very serious practicality issues when it comes to the available content. Because of the disparate nature of content, particularly between raids and M+, historically it has been a nightmare to balance classes with strong niches. Single-target specialists, for example, tend to go out of control in raid settings where a big boss is the main target - while being terrible in M+ because their AoE is so weak. Conversely, AoE burst classes have tended to dominate in M+, while being lackluster in most raid fights and overpowered in some others. And all that was with a class design that was largely homogeneous and had tons of overlap. If they emphasize strengths and weaknesses further, all I can see happening is more class stacking based on the role - essentially a reversal of their &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; philosophy and something that has proven to be a very hotly debated issue among players.<br />
<br />
A great example for the pitfalls of such design in the current state of the game is Affliction Warlock. They have a strong class fantasy and identity, but their supposed &quot;niche&quot; as multi-target specialists wreaks havoc on balance. Their single-target damage isn't amazing, but as soon as more than one target is introduced they ramp up to infinity and beyond. How to balance this without either a) nerfing their ST damage into actual oblivion; or b) curbing their multi-target potential so much the entire identity is lost to begin with? Strong spec identity simply doesn't work if you're middle of the pack in everything - see e.g. current MM hunter - or if you're over-specialized - see e.g. Elemental Shaman. And that's only talking raids, M+ is an even worse scenario where high keys are virtually completely devoid of certain specs while others are near-omnipresent.<br />
<br />
I get their intentions, and I understand that it's a positive message to people because of course everyone thinks THEIR class is going to be so much better. But that's not a practicable reality. The trend towards homogenization is taking place FOR A REASON - people don't want to feel left out because their respective class &quot;strength&quot; doesn't happen to line up with what they're trying to do right now. It's the whole &quot;wheelchair&quot; meme all over again, and ToS is perhaps the biggest warning post we can put up against what happens when specialization runs out of control. See how many people appreciated the class stacking and class prejudice that happened there? Do you really want more of that? Because trust me, people will be SO quick to jump on it, 5% DPS difference is enough for them to cry &quot;useless!&quot; or &quot;OP!&quot; let alone more. And you can cry all you want that people are being unreasonable - at the end of the day, they're the players, and they will never be REASONABLE about it because PEOPLE aren't reasonable.

And two of those three still remain. Which is even weirder, because out of the 3 classes, it makes most sense for a mage to have a knock-back ability. Fire is all about...well fire and explosions. Blasts.. Blasts cause blastwaves. Which knock things back and forth. Thunderstorm is a Lightning strike from the sky. It makes no sense for it to knock things away. Ever seen a lightning strike's aftermath irl? It doesn't explode, it doesn't knock things away.

Your class design isn't going to change human nature on the internet. Your whole post is a good read and spot on. People complain about homogenization and classes being jacks of all trades, but on the other hand the alternatives are much worse, for example: <br />
- being excluded from mythic+ that is a big part of pve / gearing content due to lack of something (aoe, cc, defensives) <br />
- being benched on specific raid bosses (remember the usual &quot;melee unfriendliness design&quot; discussion that crops up every now and then) <br />
- being undesirable class to recruit for guilds / invite to pugs due to community perception <br />
- being forced to play multiple classes to cover all the niches because each class only covers some and then have to be &quot;boosted&quot; through the content where your class sucks to be useful in the content where your class shines <br />
- guilds that can class stack due to robust roster / long bench / lots of split alts having tremendous advantage over guilds who can't afford it despite little to none skill disparity, which generally rewards nolifing more than skill (upkeeping multiple alts vs just 1 char) <br />
- being forced into a narrow role you learn to hate (read all the threads about rogues hating to be soak bots) <br />
<br />
And so forth. <br />
<br />
In practice, class homogenization had little downsides, and the upside was you could play with your friends no matter what class they picked, having more leeway in composing your pugs and guild raids with less worry &quot;oh no one from x class is around what are we gonna do&quot;. It was more practical, and more fun. I really don't miss ye olde times of &quot;lf mage, rogue and hunter for dungeon, oomkins need not apply&quot;. Now instead of sap, sheep and trap you brought aoe stuns but the general idea was again some classes had something you wanted to bring while others ended up without. <br />
<br />
And since MMORPGs are about investing into a character with levelling, gearing etc. it's not like HOTS or Overwatch where you can just decide &quot;oh my team needs this, I better pick this hero it's perfect for the occasion&quot;. It doesn't feel great if you levelled a class only to find out it's not wanted in the end game activity you were interested in, or is only wanted as a gimnick. I don't get the vanilla nostalgia where a person would be happy to be only brought to spam buff kings. <br />
<br />
Recently I read a thread where people complained that a demon hunter on mythic argus is best suited to run in the spirit realm and collect orbs - they wanted to dps instead. Now you see how it ends when you get utility - people hate it when you have to do &quot;jobs&quot; because your class has specific utility, even a narrow one like &quot;extra speed while dead&quot;. <br />
<br />
So why did the community complain about class homogenization in the first place? This is the outcome of it. And that wasn't the only thread, I mentioned rogues complaining about having to soak, then we have warlocks complaining they have to summon people, holy paladins complaining they can't deal with spread aoe healing while resto druids complain they have low overall hps and so forth. All those existing due to &quot;niches&quot; and utility classes have. <br />
<br />
And the biggest doubt in the whole picture is - can we actually carve an unique niche for as many as 36 different specs? Won't some specs have to wait ages for their 5 min of glory only to slide back to the shadows immediately after? Is it inevitable we're gonna end with &quot;meme specs&quot; people don't want to invite?</div></div><hr />

Actually the evolutionary niche (large frontal lobe) that gives us the ability to think abstractly and that results in insanity in some people, also makes us intelligent beings in the scientific sense (beings that can by their will and intellect adapt to their environment or modify it to suit them), and is what gives us the ability to reason.<br />
<br />
Nature is chaos, reason would not exist without rational thinking beings, which we are, just not all the time. <br />
<br />
The real problem with the kind of bs you mention is that there are far too many people in this game in leadership positions that are absolutely utterly fail leaders and have no business being in charge of anything. There are so many toxic guild leaders out there that expect nothing more than you to carry the raid basically, if you're even a small percentage behind but you're doing your job, a lot of guilds (most guilds, the middle pack try hards) will shit on you. Doesn't matter how strong you are most of the time, it's that miniscule amount of where you don't shine that they focus on. Fuck those people and make guilds with mature and responsible leaders that can be tough but aren't angry control freak kiddos that can barely manage them self and are basically blood sucking leeches.<br />
<br />
I mean ya, game design doesn't help, but truth is that you don't need that (you don't even see top guilds doing that shit except on progress) kinda bs drastically changed as you can eliminate most of it if you didn't stick with shitty asshole gm's/raid leaders that are just psychopathic raging lunatics in game unless everything is absolutely perfect. <br />
<br />
There's an epic shit ton of guilds in this game that just need to go and if they died the community would be all the better for it. When most raiding guilds have selfish gms that use people for their own gain you attract or influence other ppl in the raid to act the same way, and people being people they will stick it out most of the time until it's the apocalypse.</div></div><hr />

This is the absolute truth about WoW class balance/design. Spec diversity and everyone having amazing and unique damage profiles and CC is a pipe dream. There will be winners and losers during next expansions character creation screen lottery because WoW does not have 36 different niches that are also supported remotely equally in any sort of content. The closest you'll get is if you consider the entire game as a whole rather than breaking it down by what the individual player wants to actually do and even then you'll come up far short.<br />
<br />
So good luck everyone. Hopefully your class/spec is appropriate for whatever activity you actually enjoy next expansion.</div></div><hr />

The idea of bring the player not the class is a pretty nice idea, but they never really got it to work primarily because it is impossible for them to balance everything properly. With the almost complete removal of class buffs, rather than making it more about the player it simply made your class less unique.<br />
<br />
I fully understand and do kind of agree that it should be the player that is most important, but by totally removing class uniques, it takes too much away from the actual player experience. As much as it may be a pita casting buffs on people every raid or party, being able to made me personally feel closer to my class, it makes you part of a group rather than just being there on your own with a few other people. <br />
<br />
When buffs were important you felt needed, that you contributed something. Now you are just here to heal, or tank, or dps. And this isn't what I want group content to be.</div></div><hr />

They are blatantly saying they want &quot;bring the class not the player&quot; back for one which is weird, and then they are saying they don't want the synergy between resource generating talents anymore (people playing feral know what they are talking about). Then they are also saying they will pretty much remove artifact skills and fill the dead space with new skills, which is also interesting to me because IMO specs like moonkin were finally in a good place in Legion after many years of poor design, largely due to the moon spells. <br />
<br />
I'm just perplexed here wondering what I should be excited about in that philosophy. Taking away homogenization, talent synergies, artifact abilities while keeping the talent system itself which IMO is pretty bad and very rigid. On the topic of talents, they have said the same exact shit before about AoE and ST competing, complex math problems, situational etc. Idk what the point of this watercooler was. Even for Blizzard, this contained like nothing interesting.</div></div><hr />

They literally threw in the everything and the kitchen sink for ultimate fan service with Legion so now BfA and future expansions seem very barebones at best. Sure its alpha but what this long post tells me is basically they wan't to return some removed abilities because they pruned too far, they want to bring back class buffs for raid/group and tone down every class having massive CC in PvE. Talent system is fine if they remove that stupid tome but it's not really custom, some classes never change their talents for ST/AoE while other classes change 3-4 of their talents for ST to AoE fights ( Aff lock example) . It's not really fun changing talents it just like &quot;damn I gotta use this stupid tome and change 3-4 talents so I can be top tier dps with the other raiders here &quot; . <br />

It'll mean people not getting into groups that they would otherwise cos now the group needs 'this' or you're not wanted cos you don't have 'that. Meh.<br />
<br />
And with how terrible Legion has been for dev's actually listening to player feedback, this doesn't fill me with confidence.<br />
When was the last time they responded to to multiple hundred page threads from Hunters on the official feedback forums... it's been like a year. <br />

<br />
1) The devs extended the leveling experience well into the endgame by putting core rotation impacting abilities on artifact traits and legendarys, and created haves and have nots among the players based on RNG and time played which drove players away from the game in droves. Now that all of these things are going away, we have to spend all of our class design time for BFA fixing the damage this did both to class/spec kits and the community at large.<br />
<br />
2) The devs focused like a laser on making talent choices &quot;meaningful&quot; in a very specific way that had a low low low chance of success in which a microscopic raindrop of fun and connection between dev and veteran player could be had, but where it failed, it created a vast vast ocean of negativity and a huge myriad of massively negative impacts on players. In addition, this focus caused overall class/spec kits to suffer more than they ever had in WoW's history leading to widespread discontent over the state of class mechanics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take arms for example. Most of its abilities got shoved into the talent tree and nvr looked at again. Rend, overpower, sudden death on the lego, pruned heroic strike, old sweeping strikes got removed etc. pretty much left w/ cs mortal strike and slam. I really want to play warrior but they completely fucked warriors so hard. Y change a good thing... u know it's bad when old school warriors like swifty r considering rerolling from warrior.

I didn't say it was hard to read. I said the text doesn't actually give any information at all. It's just a wall of text with no actual meaning, or rather it could mean anything.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
The stuff they bring back can be improved though. If exorcism came back it doesn’t necessarily have to be the exact same thing, it can have some cool new things added to it. <br />
<br />
I play Holy/ret currently, ret has hardly any RNG involved which makes it fun for me. I agree with MoP class design for the most part. Some classes/specs were very fucking boring though (ret pally just to name one) however there was a lot less RNG in the rotations. <br />
<br />
Holy pally was fun, enhance and ele Sham were fun, lock was fun, survival hunter was fun. Those were the classes I played and I enjoyed them all but others were boring. I know arms/fury was very fun as well.<br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe by adding back abilities, rotations will be more MoP-like. MoP did have a good amount of RNG but there were a lot of abilities that helped make the RNG feel less like RNG if that makes sense. There were other things to use if your “RNG” didn’t favor you.<br />
<br />
In BFA we are getting a lot less RNG. 3 main slots can’t titanforge, no random legendaries, etc. Will see what the classes look like when beta opens up and provide feedback from there.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it can but we haven't gotten any information about that yet. Thats my point. These dev watercoolers are nice and all but rather pointless if they don't actually give any information.<br />
<br />
We also haven't really gotten any info about the amount of RNG becuase Blizzard had very little to share about BfA at all. The removal of legendaries is great but TF/WF is still there and they haven't talked at all about CDs, trinkets and maybe more importantly rewards and such.<br />
<br />
With WoD being rather lackluster and Legion downright horrible it's hard to stay positive and expect the current dev team to get this one right. Heck, even the Blizzard devs looked like they weren't sure about BfA during last years Blizzcon. Why should their customers?</div></div><hr />

The Artifact system was almost too good, I didnt have to farm for my main &quot;damage&quot; dealing thing. They needed to keep that system, and add Armor too it, make professions and gathering important again, thus leveling the gold dumps out. They painted themselves into too many corners. <br />
Legion had a great story and decent enough execution at the end, however there really isn't much left to do but a slow rotation again and again. I always said make the fighting function like kingdom hearts and you would bring the player to the class. time to take a long break and see what blizzard does, as is i find most of their games to be pretty boring now as it is</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I totally get the desire to have unique class identities with strongly defined strengths and weaknesses, this runs into some very serious practicality issues when it comes to the available content. Because of the disparate nature of content, particularly between raids and M+, historically it has been a nightmare to balance classes with strong niches. Single-target specialists, for example, tend to go out of control in raid settings where a big boss is the main target - while being terrible in M+ because their AoE is so weak. Conversely, AoE burst classes have tended to dominate in M+, while being lackluster in most raid fights and overpowered in some others. And all that was with a class design that was largely homogeneous and had tons of overlap. If they emphasize strengths and weaknesses further, all I can see happening is more class stacking based on the role - essentially a reversal of their &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; philosophy and something that has proven to be a very hotly debated issue among players.<br />
<br />
A great example for the pitfalls of such design in the current state of the game is Affliction Warlock. They have a strong class fantasy and identity, but their supposed &quot;niche&quot; as multi-target specialists wreaks havoc on balance. Their single-target damage isn't amazing, but as soon as more than one target is introduced they ramp up to infinity and beyond. How to balance this without either a) nerfing their ST damage into actual oblivion; or b) curbing their multi-target potential so much the entire identity is lost to begin with? Strong spec identity simply doesn't work if you're middle of the pack in everything - see e.g. current MM hunter - or if you're over-specialized - see e.g. Elemental Shaman. And that's only talking raids, M+ is an even worse scenario where high keys are virtually completely devoid of certain specs while others are near-omnipresent.<br />
<br />
I get their intentions, and I understand that it's a positive message to people because of course everyone thinks THEIR class is going to be so much better. But that's not a practicable reality. The trend towards homogenization is taking place FOR A REASON - people don't want to feel left out because their respective class &quot;strength&quot; doesn't happen to line up with what they're trying to do right now. It's the whole &quot;wheelchair&quot; meme all over again, and ToS is perhaps the biggest warning post we can put up against what happens when specialization runs out of control. See how many people appreciated the class stacking and class prejudice that happened there? Do you really want more of that? Because trust me, people will be SO quick to jump on it, 5% DPS difference is enough for them to cry &quot;useless!&quot; or &quot;OP!&quot; let alone more. And you can cry all you want that people are being unreasonable - at the end of the day, they're the players, and they will never be REASONABLE about it because PEOPLE aren't reasonable. Your class design isn't going to change human nature on the internet.<br />
<br />
Pretty spot on.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Explicit Teemo Nudes</div><div class="date">2018-01-25, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem, as I see it, is that there are mainly two groups of players that want different things. Not everyone in these groups want the same thing, but generally speaking.<br />
<br />
The smaller of the two groups is where all raiders, M+ and high rank arena/RBG players are. They are competitive and care more about numbers and balance over class identity and niche specs/talents/abilities.<br />
<br />
The larger group has the rest of the player base. People that don't give a shit either way, and people that do care about class+spec identity and think that's far more important than numbers and absolute balance down to 1%. Some casual raiders and M+ people, smaller guilds, playing with friends, casuals, roleplayers, solo players, levelers/alt players - those kind of players.<br />
<br />
I belong to the second group, and for me WoW is getting so boring because everything has gotten so streamlined and uncreative. I hate what the &quot;everything must be balanced down to 1%&quot; has done to the game. The adventure is gone from the game, even if Blizzard managed to bring some of it back in Legion - mainly thanks to the awesome Suramar storyline and all the puzzles/secrets.<br />
<br />
At the same time I do think that the raiding scene and such is important to the game. It belongs in a MMO game. So I do understand why Blizzard needs to listen to the smaller group aswell.<br />
I guess what I really wish for, is that the competitive people wasn't so competitive and could enjoy an adventurous game and skip the number crunching :P<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
This watercooler is such a big, fat /yawn. It's the same as always.<br />
Blizzard don't want &quot;balance&quot;. They want - and need - the game to be a rollecoaster or they won't be able to give all players what they want.<br />
They prune, then add. Prune again, then add. Repeat. Repeat again.<br />
They add systems that are &quot;better than the previous ones&quot;, but then replace them in the next expansion because &quot;they didn't work out as they had hoped&quot;.<br />
They'll never work out better than they have, and they know it. They need to add this drama to the game to keep the players. People are drawn to drama. People invest their emotions, and when you invest your emotions you get attached - and that is exactly what they want.<br />
<br />
Vanilla talent trees were bad because they were uncreative and boring. Spending talents for 1-2-3-4-5% extra frost damage is boring - but then they add that exact same thing to artifact weapons.<br />
- Hey dev crew. Don't forget that we need to make sure mages, rogues, resto druids and holy paladins have 100% pick rate as usual. Yeah, but make sure enhance shamans, holy priests and whatever other dirt at the bottom of the barrel gets a small patch window where they'll be insanely good just so these players will stick around in the hopes that one day their class will get their 15 minutes of fame again.<br />
Bring the player, not the class. No, no! Bring the class, not the player. Nah, guys, bring the player and not the class. Next expansion we bring the class and not the player.<br />
Players! We have something exciting for you in this expansion! Secrets! You will get the chance to unlock a hidden appearance for your new weapon! Exciting, huh?! They will definitely not be a low drop chance from a boss that may not even spawn once a year, or something that you buy from a vendor. No, you will unlock them in very creative ways!<br />
Also: we thought the old way of working your ass off to hit exalted with a faction and then buying the rewards is very uncreative and not fun, so we've added boxes that has an extremely low chance to drop a reward. So you need to grind to exalted a hundred times for the same faction. Gambling is so much fun and not time consuming at all.<br />
<br />
-<br />
My hopes are not high. Most will stay the same - or get worse - in the next expansion. But as I'm so deep into this game I still have that glimmer of hope that Blizzard made sure to plant in me.</div></div><hr />

PvP gearing, or some solo/small group content (These islands may be it). Basically any sort of content, which can reward you end-game gear without actually forcing everyone to raiding/mythic dungeons. Something, where different specialization could be more useful in some other aspects of the game. <br />
<br />
Because if they really want make classes more unique (which is fantastic), it means that these hardcore groups will just bench some classes even more, just because their utility is not perfectly suited for certain raids. And if Mythic and Raiding is only source of end-game top rewards, discussion about balance is always only about, and ONLY about, how they perform in raids. <br />
<br />
Maybe it is okay, if not everyone can be top dog in raids, as long as they can be top dogs somewhere else and be rewarded for it.<br />
<br />
I actually like this. I don't have the same time to devote to the game as I did. I would like to engage in more content, used to heroic raid (what would be mythic in Legion) raid lead, guild officer... all of that. Can't do it anymore for a number of reasons, but would like to not be relegated to LFR...ugh. <br />
<br />
Would especially love having meaningful endgame profession content beyond alchemy. <br />

Love the fishing legendary (still working on that) and hope they keep fishing and cooking relevant. <br />

Don’t state that as fact. Legion is one of the better expansions we’ve had imo. Wrath with it’s abysmal resource system (9 different types of badges or so) and BC with its even more so RNG legendaries I believe legion is better. You can think otherwise and maybe this is why I’m slightly more trusting than you are here. We don’t need to talk about this part though it won’t go anywhere I know where you stand and all that shit. <br />
<br />
I do agree that it was vague. They said a lot without saying anything which they’ve done before but they made their intent and their mindset fairly clear which tells us what they kinda wanna do. We need more information which we’ll get with the beta but I see no reason to run around being as bitter as you complaining as much as you. If you don’t wanna play then don’t but don’t post on the forums (official not here) burying the posts from people who do care.</div></div><hr />

If you're not going to make them massive trees with bigger and smaller buffs that actually feel fun to advance through while leveling but that you eventually get all of, just remove them completely. Talents will always be about maximizing DPS and picking the best options. There will never be a choice. It's just a pain in the ass. <br />
<br />
If you don't want to go back to massive talent trees with proper customization that affects every single thing you do, just remove the talent system and give the players the skills instead.</div></div><hr />

This was the main and best way (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2401385-Warcraft-Movie-Prop-Auction-Complete-Blue-Posts-Priest-Feedback-MDI-Announcements?p=49499286&amp;viewfull=1#post49499286), of course not everything can be &quot;modified&quot; beyond recognition, but at the same time, a lot has been done better during WotLK without unnecessary breaking of main class paradigms and design / implementation of talent system (and no any PvP/PvE = Holinka/Celestalon separate pieces):<br />
- specialization - doesn't exist, there is whole set of abilities with miserable deviations in branches of ONE GENERAL TREE = CLASS which each of branches uses in their own way, but only if player desires (= choice), and not because system has decided so for him/her (= no choice)<br />
(some tips from my new friends &lt;1 (eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/12439455182?page=27#post-538)&gt;(2nd part), &lt;2 (https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17616771936?page=2#post-32)&gt;)<br />
<br />
By the way, 1-3%-kind talents were insignificant minority in relation to really useful ones. It wasn't necessary to break anything, only edit slightly.<br />
<br />
ps. In fact, three large sections in which written next stuff: we don't know how this works and, by the way, artifacts will no longer be a thing - which was clear even without this text at the beginning of Legion. Empty conversation. More like politic's talk :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I pretty much agree with the vast majority of your words. It really sounds like Blizzard's development has finally come full circle onto their own MMORPG cycle, rounding the corner into what essentially is Vanilla WoW's design philosophy. What they fail to understand is just implementing lootbox esque psychological features while overly extending the leveling process of your game and focusing on what is essentially top tier 1% balance, you make for a game that's shitty for the average player.<br />
<br />
Look at Overwatch if you want an example of a game that exists only for top tier 'balance' (Like League of Legends I'm sure) that ends up being a horrible experience for the average player because it's not built around that players experience whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

I tink they did a great job with how the majority of classes got reworked. Specs feel alot more different in Legion then they did in WoD. While i personally prefer more changes to be made, because simply change is good, and is needed so things keep fresh and not stale, i understand that alot of players are different and just want there classes to play the same.<br />
No matter what, i think class uniquenenss is definetly desriable, and Blizz will do their job to make it good.<br />
<br />
When it comes to talents my positivity however is gone! After several expacs of this new talent system and how they did handle them in the past, i dont have any positivity left. &quot;One of the major challenges in setting up talent rows is that they serve two conflicting desires: choices within a row should be meaningfully varied&quot; I have read this statement in the past, yet Blizzard failed to deliver on its philosophy on every xpac so far.<br />
Over the past months of Legion, Blizzard actually didnt manage to rework talents which are simply bad and almost never get used. Some would require overhauls to be even looked at, and i understand that this is something u necesarilly dont want to do in the mid of an expac. But if its necesarry, then do it! On the other hand, some talents simply are in the need of tuning and number changes, yet nothing alike is seen. There are talents which are unused and undertuned since the beginning of Legion, and actually didnt get touched ONCE over the course of Legion! <br />
Additionally i think Blizzard has this strange missconception of talents to be as nummerically equal as possible. Which at the first place sounds good, but when looked into detail doesnt prove to be right.<br />
Passive Talents almost always win in this scenario, because why would u want to take an active ability with additional CD and or resource management over a passive ability if their outcome is almost the same? On top of that, talents with clear mechanical design often fail to deliver, simply because they have disadvantages but no real advantage since they are tuned so equally.<br />
Example? Retribution Tier 1 (lvl15) talents. Final Verdict - Execution Sentence - Consecration<br />
The first one is the passive all around &quot;i do everything&quot; talent, second one is an CD based single target DMG ability, and last is a stationary AoE ability. Both ES and Cons have a clear core functionallity, with a major weakness, but no real strenght! They are bad in situations which are not ST or stationary AoE, but dont excel in those situations they are made for. And therefore never ever get picked.<br />
I think the current and past talent system philosophy failed horribly. And while i want to be positive and look forward, i simply cant because of how Blizzard did handle them in the past.<br />
<br />
so long</div></div><hr />

I have to agree with some of the posters on the talent balance though - it was definitely not the best this expansion.<br />
<br />
Some talent choices are simply odd - like warlocks having mobility talent in the same tier as two survivability talents.<br />
Also, they should really tone down the approach of having all talents giving equal numeric output. <br />
Passive talent choices should always give less benefit then active ones.</div></div><hr />

They are competitive and care more about numbers and balance over class identity and niche specs/talents/abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
you are so wrong about this you have 0 idea.. high ranked arena players actually WANT more niche abilities.. because its making the game more complex, therefore making it more fun to play, harder to play and you can differentiate yourself more from the average playerbase.. thats why majority of players liked wrath/cata/mop way more despite it being perhaps at times way less balanced than the game is now<br />

<br />
Up to a certain difficulty every spec should be 'viable' in their role. This is not to say there shouldn't be any performance/output differences. There always will be and a FotM player will always jump on them. Just that there shouldn't be a spec that is clearly so sub-par for the role that they effectively will not be able to partake/compete at all. <br />
<br />
Above a certain limit, this does not hold. For truly hard content, the differences will start to matter, and then it can be expected of players competing at that level that they will know an adapt to those differences, meaning fielding the right 'alt' for the task at hand.<br />
<br />
Big question is where you put that limit. I'd say for PvE (personally don't know/care about PvP) that is somewhere around M+20/M raiding (early progression ofc, not deep in the tier when it starts to be farm/outgeared)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aggrophobic</div><div class="date">2018-01-25, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don’t state that as fact. Legion is one of the better expansions we’ve had imo. Wrath with it’s abysmal resource system (9 different types of badges or so) and BC with its even more so RNG legendaries I believe legion is better. You can think otherwise and maybe this is why I’m slightly more trusting than you are here. We don’t need to talk about this part though it won’t go anywhere I know where you stand and all that shit. <br />
<br />
I do agree that it was vague. They said a lot without saying anything which they’ve done before but they made their intent and their mindset fairly clear which tells us what they kinda wanna do. We need more information which we’ll get with the beta but I see no reason to run around being as bitter as you complaining as much as you. If you don’t wanna play then don’t but don’t post on the forums (official not here) burying the posts from people who do care.<br />
<br />
Ehm... Legion is by far the worst expansion we've had though. With way more RNG than we ever had, poor content and horrible, just horrible raids (the part I prefer the most in WoW). Wrath actually had a good reward system and when it comes to design in every other aspec MoP was the best expansion so far with parts of Cata being really great as well.<br />
<br />
You got it wrong though. They said nothing but used a lot of words to do so. The only thing you can actually take from that text is that they will focus less on balance. There is nothing else there.<br />

<br />
they are doing a u turn on the 'bring the player not the class' philosophy and going back to 'bring the class not the player' that we had in classic/TBC and most of wrath, along with trying to make some classes a bit more special snowflake cos having a different name on 'immunity spell X' is making them feel not as unique as they used to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They immediately let a hunter kill steal and ninja loot void form in front of you to make you feel completely useless by pulling Void Elves out of collective design butt cause we couldn't figure out a 6th allied race before deadline. That makes the shadow and void lore mostly mute by saying Insanity of the Void Gods is all in your head for shadow priests.<br />
<br />
It was bad enough that each time a Priest mentioned the Light, a whole battalion of Argent Paladins suddenly appeared, now the Light has a friggen space ship and their own race of Draeni too.<br />
<br />
What makes Priests unique as a class, when all the lore and what makes them distinct is carved off and given to other races and classes without a consideration for their place in lore or their place in the priest class. We have had a hard time carving a position for ourselves when you can't balance the two healing specs and can't make up your mind what shadow dps should be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They’ve stated multiple times they went too far with the pruning and throughout this statement they are reiterating the fact they want to add more abilities back and continue to try to make classes unique. They understand some feel empty and want to add more back. <br />
<br />
I know you’re negative about damn near everything but it’s quite clear they want to find a happy medium After the Prune vs Before the Prune.<br />
<br />
They say that everytime they are about to make a new expansion and even after screwups in major patches so nothing new here really.</div></div><hr />

This was the main and best way, of course not everything can be &quot;modified&quot; beyond recognition, but at the same time, a lot has been done better during LK without unnecessary breaking of main class paradigms (specialization - doesn't exist, there is whole set of abilities with miserable deviations in branches of ONE GENERAL TREE = CLASS which each of branches uses in their own way, but only if player desires (= choice), and not because system has decided so for him/her (= no choice)) and design / implementation of talent system (and no any PvP/PvE = Holinka/Celestalon separate pieces).

By the way, 1-3%-kind talents were insignificant minority in relation to really useful ones. It wasn't necessary to break anything, only edit slightly.<br />

People complain about homogenization and classes being jacks of all trades, but on the other hand the alternatives are much worse, for example: <br />
- being excluded from mythic+ that is a big part of pve / gearing content due to lack of something (aoe, cc, defensives) <br />
- being benched on specific raid bosses (remember the usual &quot;melee unfriendliness design&quot; discussion that crops up every now and then) <br />
- being undesirable class to recruit for guilds / invite to pugs due to community perception <br />
- being forced to play multiple classes to cover all the niches because each class only covers some and then have to be &quot;boosted&quot; through the content where your class sucks to be useful in the content where your class shines <br />
- guilds that can class stack due to robust roster / long bench / lots of split alts having tremendous advantage over guilds who can't afford it despite little to none skill disparity, which generally rewards nolifing more than skill (upkeeping multiple alts vs just 1 char) <br />
- being forced into a narrow role you learn to hate (read all the threads about rogues hating to be soak bots) <br />

Lel, many high ranked PvPers (esp the ones who compete in tournaments) also want to have maxed out characters from the get go because they don't want to waste time on not PvPing , e.g., levelling, farming AP, etc. Because it's a PITA to reroll and/or maintain numerous alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm ok with everything else, but how exactly are the raids horrible? Keep in mind, that I'm only speaking about heroic difficulty, but only the last two raids in MoP were interesting. I entirely skipped Tomb in Legion, but all the other raids I liked. The only beef I have is that playing as a melee DPS is extremely easy in all of them and the fact that the last boss of the expansion is way too easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heroic is never intresting though. You beat that the first night the raid is open. Still though, EN was very easy and simplistic with not a single memorable fight, ToV was ok at least with the last boss being ok. Nighthold was, same as EN not at all memorable. Maybe &quot;Starbro&quot; and Guldan could be counted as ok bosses and the &quot;hidden phase&quot; on Guldan was pretty ok.<br />
Then we have ToS, the worst raid in WoW hostory with horrible design, silly ability overlapping, the need to stack classes even after outgearing the bosses by a fair margin and littered with bugs and poor balancing.<br />
And then there is Antorus - Not as bad as ToS but not fun, with few at all intresting fights, except for maybe the last two but even thoes are no more than ok at best.<br />
<br />
Raid design in Legion is just a step down compared to anything that came befor it. People complain about WoD but that expansion at least had some sick raids with Foundry being one of the best raids ever. MoP also hade awesome raids with only HoF being so-so but still better than any Legion raid. It's like they just gave up trying in Legion.</div></div><hr />

I do not belive I belong to a minority as raiding, across the board has been going down this expansion (you can look up clears and such to get an idea about that one) and the overall attitude among raiders seems to be very, very negative.</div></div><hr />

But that's not a practicable reality. The trend towards homogenization is taking place FOR A REASON - people don't want to feel left out because their respective class &quot;strength&quot; doesn't happen to line up with what they're trying to do right now. It's the whole &quot;wheelchair&quot; meme all over again, and ToS is perhaps the biggest warning post we can put up against what happens when specialization runs out of control. See how many people appreciated the class stacking and class prejudice that happened there? Do you really want more of that? Because trust me, people will be SO quick to jump on it, 5% DPS difference is enough for them to cry &quot;useless!&quot; or &quot;OP!&quot; let alone more. And you can cry all you want that people are being unreasonable - at the end of the day, they're the players, and they will never be REASONABLE about it because PEOPLE aren't reasonable. Your class design isn't going to change human nature on the internet.<br />
<br />
Accurate - but it's easier to stomach when you're helping buff the raid with the stuff unique to your spec than it is to be benched for the classes that are powerhouse fotm completely on their own because perfect balance will always be impossible. CoE duty sucked because your dmg compared to others was often shit but you also knew that single curse debuff more than made up for it the same way a shadow priest knew they were invaluable to spellcaster mana and in rare cases healing as well.</div></div><hr />

True, but that's assuming the case of your class strength fitting the demands of the fight.<br />
<br />
What if it doesn't, though. What if you bring, idk, reduced magic damage taken - and the fight is literally all about physical damage with 0 magic? Just a random example.<br />
<br />
Now, there's two ways this can go: either your buff is nice but not too relevant to the point where it plays no role in any decision making and is just some random perk; or the buff is so good people will stack classes because of it, and consequently those that do NOT bring it will lose spots. I don't see a middle ground, really, not the way people tend to go about these things.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marrilaife</div><div class="date">2018-01-25, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Accurate - but it's easier to stomach when you're helping buff the raid with the stuff unique to your spec than it is to be benched for the classes that are powerhouse fotm completely on their own because perfect balance will always be impossible. The biggest question is how wide is gonna be the disparity between perfect setup and &quot;bad&quot; setup. From my experience, there are 2 types of mythic guilds - the hardcore (or wannabe hardcore) ones that have long bench, split alts and luxury to class stack, and those who don't - in the second category there are many guilds where people are still fairly skilled, but they don't have time to take the game so hardcore, maintain alts etc. So the question is, how much the second type of guilds is gonna be punished, because outside of top 50 they're the majority of mythic guilds. Things like pre-nerf mythic Avatar without 4 rogues or current coven without tons of multidotters / ranged is SIGNIFICANT difficulty increase just because you have a variety of classes but not the luxury to swap in extras of x type. <br />
<br />
Because of class and raid design nowadays even some guild around world 300-400 rank ask applicants / members to maintain 1+ alt for splits. This is really not what Blizzard wanted to encourage - they said openly they're against split runs, they just don't know how to nerf it to not harm the rest of the playerbase. I know many people who despise having to maintain alts, but they're fairly good players on their main. These people will have it harder and harder to find successful guilds and actually raid (instead of bench sitting if huge roster is the only alternative). <br />
<br />
I know mythic raiding is a niche, but if we take people inside that niche, is it really worth harming 80% of them to satisfy the 20% who is all the jazz about 40 man rosters, several alts for splits and so forth? <br />
<br />
In casual play you might not be concerned about that, but you'd notice other things. For example, vast class changes in Cata occurred to ensure no class is crap to level (adding self sustain to classes that lacked it like rogue or warrior), classes have plenty of cc for Cata-specific dungeons design (it was nerfed later, but the original concept required people to have tools for it... RIP bind elemental), dps specs have appropriate aoe tools and so forth. Do we really want to go back to &quot;diversity&quot; where some classes are notoriously a pita to play in levelling or dungeons? We can already see among casuals easy to level classes are more popular like hunters, all plate, druids, while less easy to level rogues, mages, priests etc. have lower representation.</div></div><hr />

1. there will be a lot more class stacking and or classes not able to be brought to boss A, C, F, and H because we need this or that ability...but class fantasy<br />
<br />
2. making talents less cookie cutter AOE/ST...I welcome them to give it their best.<br />

Legion is by far the worst expansion we've had though. With way more RNG than we ever had, poor content and horrible, just horrible raids (the part I prefer the most in WoW). Wrath actually had a good reward system and when it comes to design in every other aspec MoP was the best expansion so far with parts of Cata being really great as well.<br />
<br />
You got it wrong though. They said nothing but used a lot of words to do so. The only thing you can actually take from that text is that they will focus less on balance. There is nothing else there.<br />

<br />
<br />
That is pretty much the tl;dr, yeap.<br />
<br />
Yeah everything your saying is opinion not fact. If you can’t even understand something that simple there’s no reason to continue the conversation. <br />
<br />
Yes the RNG with legion is terrible but the systems that it brought (M+, scaling, the best version of dailies,AP, artifact weapons) make up for it. The RNG drags it down but the new systems make it fun. Wrath’s reward system was awful in a different way. The raids were bad for the most part I agree and I wish they’d remove TF or at the very least cap Titanforging because it’s causing all kinds of balancing issues. <br />
<br />
MOP was very good I agree. Stayed subbed for the entire expac just like I have with legion. The endless grind of dailies was garbage but the raids were good, reward system was good, there was a cap on warforged gear and a great legendary questline as well as good class design. Legion is just as good in other ways like M+, Artifacts, zone scaling was great, etc. <br />
<br />
Either way you’re free to have your own opinions. I think MoP, legion and Wrath are the best 3 expacs we’ve had. You can think otherwise that’s fine but I believe BFA has the potential to be better than both MoP and legion. Need to see where everything goes and when the alpha (or beta?) opens up we’ll start to see what’s up.<br />

Nothing could be scarier than this talk about 'differentiation' because I already know how it will go: some randomly selected subset of classes/specs being OP while others get a 'strong utility' that does not matter in the real content. Then blizz will sit on their asses for a major patch or two. Here's hoping I will guess right on what is OP judging from the beta.</div></div><hr />

Newb, completely green. Reads a blue post and takes them for every word<br />
<br />
Been playing for a year and have a great understanding of a few classes. begins to post on forums. Begins to question blue posts sincerity<br />
<br />
5 year vet Having mastered your mains class and maybe a few others along with a stable of competent alts: Completely ignores Blue posts for what they are now. Apologies written in completely PC form while also threading in excuses for a certain design flaw, major or not. And most importantly never acknowledging that they done fucked up and should/will not re-introduce said implementation again. Soo you created in the gaming sense a Jar-Jar Binx....own it. Just dont repeat your mistakes<br />

10 year vet. Completely jaded from lack of authenticity of blue posts begins to find immense amusement from reading them, almost as much as their favorite book. Completely revels in the contradiction and misinformation that they think the reader is completely oblivious to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
M+ imo is the best thing added to the game since vanilla. It’s one reason I’d barely want to play on classic realms. It’s extremely fun to push high keys and make timers. <br />
<br />
Artifacts add a new way to progress your character. Powering up your weapon with AP and unlocking new traits/skills along the way was very interesting. They did mess it up in the beginning but it got much better after 7.2. <br />
<br />
WQs are a much better version of dailies and can even be applied throughout the entire world. <br />
<br />
I’m not sure what you enjoy from the game if none of those things are a positive to you. Did you like the hard dungeons in BC? High M+ can be even harder especially with certain affixes. <br />
<br />
I get that you don’t like all the RNG. I don’t either, however there was a ton of it present in the past too. The gearing system was more linear and less RNG yeah but the legendaries were still very much RNG in vanilla and BC. Azerite Armor could potentially be a much better gearing system than we’ve seen in the game to date but who knows yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did like the TBC and Cata dungeons. Hard dungeons are fun, timed dungeons are not. Having to do the same dungeons 1000+ times to stay competative is not fun either and the timers are just annoying. Legion is all about doing the same content over and over again - Quantity over quality. <br />
<br />
WQs are the same for the most part. It's reused leveling quests that you do evey day and it never ends. The ones that aren't just reused have no connection to the lore or story of the game at all - I mean, why would picking acorns and kicking squirrels help fighting the legion? On top of that, they are usually placed all over the world with no connection, just to increase the time it takes to do them. Without flying it was one of the most unpleasant experiences I've ever had in WoW and they even brought that back with the horror that is Argus. That zone is one of the worst zones in any MMO, ever.<br />
<br />
And no, there was nowhere near the amount of RNG in past expansion. The actual chance of getting an item or even a legendary might have been lower but the amount of systems based in randomness in Legion is beyond anything we've had befor. Classes, talents, trinkets, all forms of rewards like legendaries, WF/TF, even the M+ keyes, PvP gear, everything in the game is random. There is zero control over anything you do. The game is turned into an online casino, not an RPG<br />
<br />
And as you bring up legendaries. They were not at all random in every expansion. Wrath, Cata, MoP and WoD had quests for them. While parts of them might have been somewhat random most of it was not. <br />
Back in Vanilla, you were lucky if a single player in your guild had one legendary. Now they are mandatory and if you lacked the better ones at least during the first half of Legion you had no place in rainding or higher m+. That was never the case during any of the previous expansions where lehendaries were drops. It's not even comparable.<br />
<br />
The sloppiness Blizzard has shown during Legion is beyond belief. I mean, just look at the last patch. That one broke just about everything. Raids, dungeons, leveling, transmogs, loot, performance, everything. So no, pretty mcuh everything Blizzard has done in Legion is of less quality than what they did in previous expansions. Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don’t start talking about broken patches but then praise the past. Vanilla was basically all broken and BC had so many bugs it was insane. Please god don’t talk like it’s a legion specific thing. There has been a lot worse than what happened with this patch. Bosses being completely unkillable, classes running around being invincible, looting corpses taking 20 minutes, etc. If you wanna call 7.3.5 sloppy fine but saying it’s worse than anything ever shows you probably haven’t played the game much in the past. <br />
<br />
In BC you did the exact same dungeons all the time. That’s just how it is. Unless there’s 50 dungeons your going to get some repetition. I guess you think the BC dungeons are quantity over quality as well since you apparently think running the same dungeons all the time is bad?<br />
<br />
You liked the Cata and tbc dungeons but they have the exact same issue you say the legion dungeons have. You’re complaining so much you’re getting hypocritical. There was never any variation in dungeons aside from maybe vanilla when it actually had a ton of dungeons, tbc and Cata were both repetitive. <br />
<br />
I never said legendaries were random in every expansion. Read please. I was referencing the past RNG legendaries which obviously only applies to BC and vanilla. And yes they were just as bad if not worse than legions because if those one or two players did have those legendaries it made a fairly big difference in progression/The world first race, way more than it does now. <br />
<br />
A lot of what you’re saying is very hypocritical. Especially the fact that you say you like Cata/BC dungeons and the difficulty but you don’t like legion dungeons and the difficulty because it’s repatitive even though that applies to all 3 of those expansions. M+ is a lot less repetitive because the affixes change things up as well as higher keys. You re-ran the exact same dungeons in BC, Wrath, Cata, MoP and legion but legions dungeons have much more variation due to affixes/difficulty changing between high/lowkeys.<br />
<br />
You’re also repeating the same points. I already agreed with you about the raid quality this expansion. ToS was probably the worst raid I’ve seen in a long long time tuning wise and the other raids weren’t too much better (NH, Helya and Antorus are pretty good).<br />
<br />
I also agree with the RNG. It’s getting toned down a lot going into BFA so I’m not going to stress about it anymore but it was definitely terrible. If not for all the RNG legion would’ve easily been the best by far imo, but I’m glad to see a lot of it going away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying vanilla or BC was great though. WoW was at it's best in early Cata or MoP in my opinion. I just said everything was better than Legion. Also, I really can't remember a single patch that ruined as much as this 7.3.5 did. The WoD release was comparable but that was just more players than Blizzard expected not just sloppy work and refusal to test things or even change the things that were already reported as broken on the PTR.<br />
<br />
Cata dungeons did not have the same issues. Once you had your gear you were done and they did not have timers.<br />
<br />
Yeah, but legendaries did not play as large of a role in vanilla (most never saw them at all) or in BC. Again, it's not even comparable. You have to have RNG on your side now but it was just a small bonus back then. Blizzard seems to agree and they are gone in BfA<br />
<br />
I didn't say I disliked Legion dungeons becuase of their difficulty. I said I dislike them becuase of the timers and I dislike the system that is designed around running thoes dungeons endlessly. You're never &quot;done&quot;. If there is one thing MMO players tend to like it is filling up bars. Ghost Crawler spoke a bit about this if you're intrested but in any case, there are no bars to fill up anymore. You can never been done and so it feels pointless to even try. There is no goal.<br />
The same is true for many of the systems in Legion and it's frustrating as heck.<br />
<br />
There are other issues of course such as poor zone design, PvP, and class design among other things.</div></div><hr />

I agree with MoP being probably one of the best expansions maybe the best. I just really hated the endless daily grind. I have to disagree about the timed dungeons though I love it. 2-3 cheating feels very good and there’s enough dungeons in legion for it to feel fairly refreshing when doing different ones. <br />
<br />
I agree with no bars to fill up anymore. That’s changing as well with BFA but I do agree for the most part. Artifact skins were a bar to fill up though (collecting all of them) as well as AP (hitting 75 and being done). <br />
<br />
I’m going to agree to disagree. We agree on a lot but disagree on some. At the very least, a lot of what you seem to dislike is going away with BfA and stuff that you like will be present (like filling up bars aka azerite gear/HoA neck).</div></div><hr />
