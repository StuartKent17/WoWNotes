do you need to hit level 12 prestige PER SPEC to unlock the Artifact skin or once you do it on one its unlocked on all specs.<br />
The current plan is to unlock every spec's appearance on that character. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/712079269548023808))<br />

Will Siege of Orgrimmar be solo-able in Legion?<br />
I'd expect so. At level 110, with an 800+ item level, your stats will be comparable to what a small raid could do in 5.4. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/712372137332310016))</div></div><hr />

As for SoO, I doubt it'll be soloable because you need two to use the turrets on Galakras, and Spoils needs 2. I don't want them nerfing it just so people can get their crap faster. It's easy to form a group with friends/guildies/in Premades.</div></div><hr />

idk where you get the b rate vibe from, but even duncan jones has said that the posters and marketing in general for the movie wasnt to his liking. but sadly thats a whole other department, and beyond his control<br />

Glad that they dropped the unfitting music and tried to have a better flow of scenes coming after each other. Not saying the movie will be good, some of my concerns like the humans not blending in with all the CGI still remains. And the movie looks kinda ''Hollywood fied''.<br />

This is so hella true. Affleck was amazing as Batman/Bruce Wayne though. All in all the worst superhero movie so far and that's coming from someone who's seen Daredevil.

Deadpool was incredible and Batman vs Superman was better than I was expecting, and that was not much. Elektra was bad, Catwoman was really bad, and I expect Warcraft to be better than these. I also hope it will be better than &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. *g*</div></div><hr />

Releasing a trailer online is not pouring money and resources into promotion. They have not spent anywhere near what The Force Awakens spent.<br />
<br />
But hey- such a 'safe' answer to judge a movie so early so you will not get let down. I know that has to be rough. Better keep playing it safe. <br />

I don't know why everyone is complaining about Daredevil and Elektra. Okay, they could not deliver compared to the hype around them...but just like the Ghost Riders or Spawn, they are good enough for friday evening tv. Catwoman on the other hand...well...let's not go down there...:cool:<br />

After getting disapoint by Batman Vs Superman this year. My expectation for Warcraft and Civil War are really low. T.T<br />
<br />
You really expected that BvS will be a good movie? An undefeatable superhuman vs. a normal dude with a few gadgets...and both want to protect the world. That plot spells &quot;FAIL&quot; right from the start. Stuff like that works in a comic(more or less)...but not if you have to make it believable for a movie.<br />
My expectations for the warcraft movie went down when I heard they want to use real actors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I enjoyed the humor but not a lot else.<br />
<br />
As for Warcraft, better trailer but still the Warcraft games have a very distinct art to them in which they've tried to replicate in the movie and it just looks out of place in a movie.<br />
<br />
Orcs at least the main characters in the movie look amazing (Durotan/Orgrim/Gul'dan) however the costume department just made everything look horrid, sure they're trying to keep it as close to the source material as possible but come on Anduin / stormwind armor looks plastic on screen it really is an eyesore.<br />
<br />
Some of the spell animations we've seen so far look alright but some of the landscapes we've seen in the trailers look questionable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
U right that Ben do a excelent job as a Batman, and it show how much he have grow as a actor. <br />
<br />
But hell that wasnt the Batman fans deserv for a Cinematic universe. That was a bloody killer that give a s...t about who he kill, plus he was so much idiot that let Lex to manipulate him all the movie (there it goes the tittle of Greatest worlds detective)<br />

Also the druids animations look kinda bad, only barkskin looks good, thrash and swipe are horrible.<br />
<br />

Specifically on the Garona not betraying the king bit, I actually think that she will, after watching the trailers.<br />
<br />
In the TV spot 4 trailer at 20 seconds in, Anduin gives Garona a dagger.<br />
<br />
Then, in most of the other trailers, we get a shot of Anduin kneeling over someone in golden armor with a dagger in his neck. The dagger look suspiciously like the one Anduin gave Garona, and the armor looks a lot like King Llane's golden lion armor. <br />
<br />
So, I'm about 99% sure Garona still goes nuts on the king in this movie, despite the movies other differences with the canon Warcraft universe events, during that time period.</div></div><hr />

Glad that they dropped the unfitting music and tried to have a better flow of scenes coming after each other. Not saying the movie will be good, some of my concerns like the humans not blending in with all the CGI still remains. And the movie looks kinda ''Hollywood fied''.<br />
<br />
And that poster looks ridiculous, for fuck sake its like some fan stitched it together. Why did they use the space as background??<br />
<br />
As I said in another thread, the posters are a major disappointment for a franchise so rich in lore, art and style.<br />
<br />
As a designer, this one makes me cringe hard - they created a composition that leads the eye to the big black hole in the middle. I get what they were trying to do - emphasis the tension between the two factions, but they failed, hard. <br />
<br />
And that font style is appropriate for an action car movie, not a fantasy setting. <br />
<br />
The posters don't do the movie any justice at all. And the real shame is, someone was paid to make them - and movie posters aren't cheap.</div></div><hr />

No, just based on the original Warcraft, but they're bringing Durotan and Orgrim to the forefront. So while the First War is going on, it's going to show the conflict within the Horde, which ultimately leads to Durotan's exile/death and Orgrim killing Blackhand to become the new Warchief.<br />
<br />
As part of that, they're introducing some new stuff where Lothar is going to work together with Durotan and Garona. I'm guessing it'll still follow the general plot as we know it, but they'll basically weave Durotan's backstory into the plot and have him take part in some key events. And it'll probably end with the Frostwolf orcs traveling North in exile, as a parallel with the refugees of Stormwind fleeing to Lordaeron.<br />
<br />

<br />

I think she'll definitely kill him. She's been shown with the dagger in the trailer, and it's the same dagger sticking out of the neck of a dead body in the trailer, which seems to be wearing Llane's armor.</div></div><hr />

Well, there's WoW, but there's also Hearthstone, which I think is a potentially even more lucrative market for them to tap into. There are already millions of Hearthstone players (many of whom have never played other Warcraft games) who might be interested in the movie. And if people like the movie, Hearthstone is an extremely accessible game for casual players, given that it's F2P and available on Android and iOS in addition to PC and Mac.<br />
<br />
<br />
love the new trailer i like how it says the beginning at the end makes me think this is just the start of something big<br />
It's being released as Warcraft: The Beginning in international markets. Which bodes pretty well for its chances of getting a sequel.</div></div><hr />

The cg from what I've seen is right where it should be. I don't see as an animation artist myself where it should be better? And its the first film in the franchise. It will only get better every movie. That's how it works. I get that tons of you enjoy being trolls but your arguments have no sound basis. There is just not enough to go on from a few preview seconds and screen shots of those previews. And when a movie HAS to be 90+% CG you are going to have moments where you go, ok, yeah that didn't quite hit the mark. This isn't star wars where everyone is real and they blue screen it. There are like a handful of real people based on what I've seen. The CG is going to be what it is, and that doesn't make the story, or the action or the outcome. <br />
<br />
And then everyone talking about this movie ruining the game for them. WHAT THE HELL is wrong with everyone. Why would creating a movie about a made up story kill the game for anyone? Everyone has been pushing for this movie for like 8 years now. Why would it make the game less appealing now that it's almost dead anyways? I think the movie being placed this far back where it started gives the franchise room to create more story's and movies for warcraft in the event that its a huge hit. On top of that there has been no release of full movie length. If this is a 3 hour film and you are judging it based on a 30 second snippet, I mean common, who's the bad guy here (you). If you were a fan of wow and the lore and the books, then this movie gives us all something to look froward too. It gets us off the computer, into an immersive story that becomes more then just a cut scene between raid bosses and lets us enjoy it with our friends and familys so that they can be immersed in the world of geekdom that we've so much become part of. This above everything in wow Is what I've been waiting for. And I guarantee this will spike game play from not only veterans but new players a like.</div></div><hr />

Then again you could sway others with your reasonings.. thats y know.. the main reason for having speech n stuff.<br />
<br />
Then again, I totally agree with you, movie looks corny, it'd have been better if they made it the same way they make the game intros... this is going to flop, possibly even more because everyone watching it will most likely e reckognised as a wow player.. something which has its own whole boatload of prejudices tied into it.</div></div><hr />

You can't say being an &quot;animation artist&quot; gives your opinion higher value. I majored in animation in college and I agree with people who are worried about the movie's reception. It doesn't take an expert to see that they're avoiding shots with long Orc dialogue. The Orc mouth movement is hard to sell for me. How can they realistically talk with those huge tusks in their mouth? Looks awkward. True, they could have a long way to go in development still. It might look great on the final production, but I think it's safe to say it will be hard to top CG on say, a movie like Avatar. This is a fantasy world with a lot more radical-looking creatures than tall blue people. For a vast majority of the &quot;general public&quot; I'm guessing this movie will feel very cheese, and the general public are the ones who are going to judge it and give it a critical rating. As for myself, I will like it regardless cause I'm already a huge fan. Most people on here are just voicing their concern. We want it to be received well by fans and genera public alike, and that's what we're all hoping for. :)</div></div><hr />

Man, I had to create an account just for this comment. Here's a comparison between the first trailer from November 2015 and this trailer. Literally nothing has changed. Every single shot is 100% the same save for some color filters. Dat placebo effect.<br />

on durotan warcry pics,<br />
check the cloud coloring stormwind's sky,<br />
and the following 2x2 pics of battle show many passes of lighting,<br />
the running on the snow.<br />
<br />
So there is obvious development going on, i would assume they are giving passes and passes over all video scenes of lighting and bringing all the green tone down. Obviously some pics are identical, so it just means, i hope, they just didnt pass over them yet OR the color balancing is ok.<br />
<br />
Anyway, you saying LITERALLY NOTHING HAS CHANGED is kinda wrong, or to rephrase that, i personally didnt expect new CGI on the scenes we have already seen, after all color filters is what made 50% of the nerds angry in here. &quot;green screen sucks&quot;</div></div><hr />

Well, my original response was to someone saying &quot;the cgi on the orcs especially their facial expressions has improved drastically&quot;. The only change to footage we've already seen is minor color adjustment. I don't believe a simple color filter change qualifies as &quot;drastically improved CGI&quot;, and color correction has little to do with the CGI in the first place. I can film myself right now and throw a color filter over it. Does that mean I created a video with CGI that I just improved?<br />
<br />
There is no obvious development going on as far as the shots that we've seen since last year are concerned. These shots are entirely unchanged, save for some that have had color corrections, which is something that is done for any scene, not just CGI scenes. Hell, the only CGI shot that has actually changed since we first saw it in 2015 is the shot where Durotan is speaking to Anduin Lothar, and they cropped the lower half of Durotan's body out to hide an animation issue rather than fix it for the trailer. That's not much in the way of development. The ten seconds or so of new CGI footage in this latest trailer also does not appear to be noticeably different in quality when compared to previous trailer footage. Now, don't get me wrong: this is not to say they can't have been working on these shots since we first saw them in November 2015, but any work that may have been done is not (yet) reflected in any trailer footage. Claiming the models and animations have improved/changed in these shots is quite simply just a false statement. They are unaltered.<br />
<br />
People see a trailer that's edited slightly better than the, um... less than stellar ones that came before and suddenly the CGI is better. People watch a poorly edited trailer with unfitting music and the CGI is bad again. CGI improvements seem to be all in the mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pick one. CGI is in almost every major movie now, from backgrounds, to crowd scenes, anything involving car stunts - the stuff you buy as real, but was done on a computer. That's the hard stuff, the best of the best. Stuff like orcs and dragons and hobbits get a lot of attention, but the best work is the stuff you don't even notice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Creating explosions and flipping cars is much easier than creating mythical creatures and magical effects that are the focal points of the entire movie.<br />
<br />
Obviously, it is pretty early to say either way... but from what I've seen, Warcraft seems to be putting that type of CGI a big step ahead.</div></div><hr />

Its not BAD, its indeed very good for computer graphic!! <br />
<br />
I believe what most of us feel is that the CGI here dont blend so well with the live actors, and the scale is somehow off.<br />
Perhaps, because, wow always had that hyperbolist approach, (which is called cartoonish by some people), so the orcs are huge and massive, which is ok for a video game but is strange in a RL movie, if its not a Hulk sequel.<br />
<br />
Thats why i think, if they went with CGI humans too, that would be better solution. My 2copper.<br />

<br />
But you would always know that it's CGI, because they told you it was... and also because those creatures don't exist in the real world, so regardless of the quality, you know it's CGI, so it's biasing your view upon it...<br />
<br />
But with the example of Deadpool, most of the movie you don't even realize it's CGI because you haven't been told it was... And I've tried seeing the scene after knowing it's CGI, and suddenly, CGI stands out...<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, the CGI here is okay, when you look a screenshots of the uncompressed version, the orcs look very real, and this is VERY good CGI, maybe not the best (especially the gryph), but it's amazingly good, and your argument about knowing about it being CGI is invalid because it's obvious that it's CGI.<br />

<br />
The movie is gonna be the cliche of the cliches. The Romeo and Juliet stuff, and the &quot;you and your worst enemy are actually on the same boat&quot; is sooooooooooo boring. I don't care how good the CGI got. The problem is the obvious american patriotic plot of uniting forces in honor and pride and getting along because we're all the same deep down. Blergh. I will download the movie like 8 months from now, and will watch it when I have a floo afternoon or something.<br />
<br />
Oh so now you can judge an entire plot just from a 1min trailer ?? What bout the 119 (or so) other minutes ? No doubt there will be some plot elements that are not in the trailer...</div></div><hr />

Hypocritical...<br />
<br />
Don't tell me you're interested in every movie...<br />
Don't tell me you can't compare critics when you're not sure about a movie...<br />
<br />
The trailer is here to hype you, If you're not hyped, you can still wait a few days for others to see it and read critics... no need to go broke...<br />
<br />
Also I don't know if you have this in your country, but here in France some cinemas have a subscription system, you pay 20€ a month and you can go se any movie, anytime you want, without limitations. If you're that much interested, no need to go broke, subscribe to your cinema...<br />

I had nothing against this movie... but I just watched the trailer and stopped at several scenes -- it's like they didn't even try lol. I mean, that horse looks like somebody just put it straight in there out of paint -- no attempts at making it look like part of the scene. Then there's the fact that there's an orc with a broken arm on the left (swinging...), an orc with a Skeleton head (wtf?), a Knight/Guard that's looking the wrong direction... one that's supposed to be attacking an orc but couldn't possibly... let's not talk about the Knight/Guard dead underneath the horse or whatever the heck it is... <br />
<br />
IDK man, IDK. BUT HEY. It's cool. We got the neato elves in the cathedral scene. Thank god they didn't have those (they look HORRIBLE)</div></div><hr />

Nope... Im whining that people make non-comparative and non-factual &quot;opinions&quot; just for the sake of criticizing... It's like if i say that orcs on Lord of the Rings look fake because.. they are too dark, or they are too short... <br />
<br />
It's ridiculous and nonsensical. At least they could give a opinion based on a comparative argument. Other than that is just hating and trolling.</div></div><hr />

I agree that this shot doesn't look good, but the elves look pretty decent in my opinion.</div></div><hr />
