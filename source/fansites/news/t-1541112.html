Welcome to another Artcraft! I’m Chris Robinson, art director on WoW, and today we’re keeping it short and sweet with a reveal of the updated male Human model. As with the previous model redesigns, our goal here was to honor the silhouette and style of the original, while increasing fidelity and fixing some of the big issues we’d identified. The male Human has long been a source of criticism from some of you for his odd proportions and face geometry. We’ve taken great care to ensure we’re not changing so much that he looks completely unlike anything you’d expect, while also correcting some of the more glaring problems. We hope you enjoy the results!<br />

On a slightly separate topic: I wanted to give you a quick heads up that we’re expecting some in-progress models to be hitting the Warlords of Draenor alpha test soon. While these will give you an early look at some of the models, please be aware that they aren’t finished yet. We’ll be presenting final high-quality model captures in future Artcrafts, so stay tuned!</div></div><hr />

it would be nice for WoW to have that sort of customisation, it doesn't make much sense for a priest to be as built as a warrior, doubt we will ever see that level of customisation in WoW though : (</div></div><hr />

Blood Elves are THAT way, go play them if you want the hairless femboy look.<br />
<br />
Some people want to play a stereotypical manly man, and I'd say that involves bodily hair to varying degrees. The hairless waxed himbo look isn't exactly what you'd expect to see on a man from a medieval-level society.</div></div><hr />

They will. This is the very, very, very early preview for a single skin tone and face.<br />

Humans. Way too beefy. Especially the new model.<br />
Undead. Too many bones/insanely thin waist/tiny weapon models. Annoying as heck to look at if you paid a lot of gold for your xmog.<br />

Some people want to play a stereotypical manly man, and I'd say that involves bodily hair to varying degrees. The hairless waxed himbo look isn't exactly what you'd expect to see on a man from a medieval-level society.<br />

<br />
And if they were more normal sized how would you expect those humans to fight against Orcs? hmm? Take a look at Garrosh or any other orc, you would die in a fraction of a second if you weren't bulky as Blizzard makes the humans. Also how would you wear all that armor on you by being more normal and not bulky? Carry those big ass 2handed swords? How?</div></div><hr />

As for the &quot;OMG TOO BULKY&quot; argument... male humans were always bulky. <br />

I agree with this. Some running animations just don't look good from behind (where most of us are when we're playing our characters). Human males, Orc females and Undead males have, in my opinion, really dumb looking running animations when I see them from behind as I play those characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't get why people are complaining about the muscles so much. Blizzard has already stated they don't want to change the basic body shape, after it's been the same for 10 years. It wasn't going to slim down. At the same time, the texture was going to get more detailed and less blurry, with finer lines. All that was going to bring out the muscles more, as it has with all of the previous models.<br />
<br />
Good job Blizz. Humans now look decent, and living.<br />
<br />
I am going to wait till we see Blood Elves, and then laugh and laugh at the comments of outrage, I know that much. We can pretty much know how they are going to look like. They are going to be great, and comparable to everything we've seen so far, but all people hate will be triple so, for those models. Going to be great.<br />
<br />
On a more serious note, I worry a little about Female Blood Elf faces. This Human Male has a ton of facial detail, and Blood Elf Male will be the same. But the Draenei Female was lacking much detail to her face to give her personality, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ravenmoon</div><div class="date">2014-06-26, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">not particularly overwhelmed, and not wow'd, but it is a MASSIVE improvement on the old model.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
Like that well he looks like a man<br />
He is a bit ugly, but then, i guess in wow, pretty/good looking is an exclusively Elven thing (probably blood elven only at this rate)<br />
I like that he gets body hair - so tired of waxed men - looking androgenous almost like artist feel that muscles are the only features men have, glad the art team went up on the body hair. - no adam's apple though, which again looks weird.(but could be wrong, there is a hint of one in one of the shots)<br />
I noticed they've stuck to the vein of the old model, and no questions, this is an improvement all round - i can't say (like i did for the night elf female, that one of the old model faces was nicer).<br />
<br />
if i were to change anything, I'd probably add an adam's apple and make him a bit better looking, otherwise a good job, but not a WOW factor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Body<br />
<br />
Body detail is very good, like the muscle definition<br />
Like the vein on the bicep, <br />
Legs seemed well muscled<br />
Not sure about the proportion, neck looks a bit too padded<br />
Torso too long, legs too short, esp the femur - groin to knee<br />
Definition on feet and hands really good, even the forearms aren't bad<br />
Calves seem a bit too thick almost squallid, a trim there is good.<br />
Abs defintion is good, they did a good chest.<br />
Like that he has a naval - hope that gets added to both elven males<br />
<br />
Body hair is an excellent touch, really impressed with the detail of the hair.<br />
Chest hair is a nice suited mat, abs hair, for once male like, and fore arm and leg hair - good detail, i hope at least the NElf male gets body hair<br />
<br />
<br />
Expressions<br />
<br />
First impression only from still shots.<br />
The expressions need work.<br />
A bit too goofy, <br />
No real funny expressions too.<br />
They should tell the mood that is expected of a stormwind human<br />
I get the feel of almost there, but not quite, like something is off, <br />
The smile expression, I kinda see where it's going it's not pure delight smile but almost a forced, &quot;not sure i should be smiling&quot; smile, the eyes need adjustment to match the expression better<br />
The confused expression, should be the funny expression that makes us laugh, but he looks a bit too silly almost &quot;not take him seriously&quot; but that might be the warcraft vein of things, so the fans remember to laugh, maybe a second expression like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Extras:<br />
<br />
Hairstyles - the guy doesn't look good in those old blood elf male hairstyle - he's not a young man or a teenage man, the hairstyle doesn't fit.<br />
Lips - things like lips, eye shape are things i hope will change with more face options<br />
Age - he looks like a man, 40 year old roughly, which is about the age that there is just no vestige of youth left , there is a hardness, which works good for warcraft, again those who wanna play young men can probably have blood elves fill that niche.<br />
Nose - seems like a similar thing to the night elf female, the nose seems like it's got plastic surgery done recently, can it blend into the face better?<br />
Adam's apple a bit more prominent too than it is on the current neck, a feature that should maked both elven males (NElves more prominent, Belves less prominent, and trolls)</div></div><hr />

This keeps coming up. I agree that the proportions are off, but they've said a million times that the goal is to stick as close to the original style and look as possible while updating the textures and animation. You KNOW if they changed the hulking forearms people would complain that the new models look too different from the old, which is why they're just going for an update and not a completely new design.</div></div><hr />

Face looks good, definitely an improvement, though I wish that there'd be different types of faces for the human. Looks really a lot like Varian. Also the body looks weird. They were always supermuscular but now it looks like they just learned to walk upright 3 days ago. And the arms look a bit too long and too thick, remind me of the dwarf.</div></div><hr />

I like the head but the body is a little overboard for warriors, way overboard for casters. A human mage/lock/priest, even thieves, will look completely ridiculous. Tone the muscularity down about 20% and they'd be great. Why would a human mage or priest have bigger forearms than a orc bicep lol?</div></div><hr />

Think the hair looks a bit unfinished here personally, and I'd hope it is. Overall I dig it though, have a feeling the caps don't do it justice and a moing &quot;living&quot; version will look a lot cooler.<br />
<br />
The best rendition of it here is the far right on the last pic. That sells it for me alone whereas the rest seems a bit in need of a touch up. I can see my Human Male DK looking pretty awesome with his grey hair and glowy eyes with that stubble going on.</div></div><hr />

I find it hilarious, the way you stand up to defend their decisions with such passion that is. I get it, you are a fan, but you shouldn't let that shorten your sight. First of all, no-one mentioned anything about anime (which are Japanese, by the way) how and why you went so far to assume that is beyond me. Is it because of my avatar? Well, it is not anime related, just random art.<br />

What you said may make sense, but there are others who think that casters should be feebler, with thinner physique.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aliok</div><div class="date">2014-06-26, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm prefacing my opinion with the statement that I appreciate that players have different tastes and desires in their in-game avatars. Your opinion is yours and mine is mine. I strive to live by the &quot;It's okay to not like things (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0la5DBtOVNI)&quot; credo.<br />
<br />
Well... it is an improvement. I'm disappointed about the musculature though. I was really hoping that the overly-large forearms would at minimum be reduced to match the upper arms. That is the number one reason why I do not play male humans.<br />
<br />
I'm not much of a fan of the new chest hair, either. That is one of things I do like about the male human model. (This makes me wonder if male blood elf is going to develop chest hair, too...)<br />
<br />
The shape of the face is... different. I don't think I care much for it, but I probably just need time to become used to it. I am glad there is more definition thanks to better shading of the skin. In fact, seeing the wrinkling of the skin on the forehead and near the eyes is a pleasant surprise. I can't wait to see it animated.<br />
<br />
I am a little worried for the hair. I observed that the low ponytail is notably shorter on the hi-res version versus the original. Also, what is with the massive, weighty hair... band thingies? SAVAGE™ is only the theme of one expansion; we're going to be stuck with these models for much longer.<br />
<br />
There is something creepy about the mouth. I think it's the teeth. It isn't natural.<br />
<br />
I also observed that male human gets to wear skivvies that aren't from the caveman era. I'd like this for female human, please.</div></div><hr />

That's a matter for customization, which they've said is something they're gonna have to take a look at later. Right now they're just remaking the models, and making Humans skinnier all of a sudden wouldn't make sense.<br />

It's the exact same silhouette on many parts, only difference is now he's 'detailed'. You could tell the original human male was meant to be well toned and muscled, but obviously because of the 'simplicity' of the design back then we get these weird vague 'shadings' to imply texture and muscle.<br />
<br />
On the subject of casters, yeah, it would be nice to have multiple bodyframes and animation sets, but still, it's an amazing difference. On the bright sides, Casters worried about that will just see the silhouette anyhow(because of armor). So you will have the same 'appearance' before and after, except for the face, if you decide to leave helmet off. Mostly I think this will help npcs look better than players, XD. <br />
<br />
That's really a major thing about how I think the new models will be after WoD's been released for a while, people going back to transmogging in their favorite helm. Still doesn't mean it wasn't worth doing, and still going to effect npcs and prevent them from 'clashing' with all the other new art and textures out there. And it's still beneficial to people that love to toggle helmets off on a large number of characters, like myself.<br />
<br />
On a side note, now that they have body hair, I wonder if we'll see any of it showing through on some of the vanity cloth/shirt sets. Can anyone think of any shirts ingame that are 'cut' low enough to show the hair on the new model? I need answers for my bank alt!!!</div></div><hr />

I do remember them talking about the possibility of even adding 'sub-race' skins. It's good to know, hopefully they'll do more for customization in the future, because it's quite poor as is.

<br />
The face looks really good, if you can accept the caveman style. It looks a bit like Varian, which was also to be expected and isn't a bad thing. The animations look good.<br />
<br />
Sadly, still no wrists though, and the arms are buffer than the legs -- the body still looks really weird. But I understand that they didn't want to drastically alter the silhouette and I think it's probably a good thing, for those people who actually like the body of their human male characters. Additional options would certainly be amazing, maybe one day we'll get that in WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's such a disappointment for somebody like me that enjoys playing male cloth casters.<br />
<br />
Humans. Way too beefy. Especially the new model.<br />
Undead. Too many bones/insanely thin waist/tiny weapon models. Annoying as heck to look at if you paid a lot of gold for your xmog.<br />
Bloodelf. Way too feminine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's sad that there's no way to play a slender male character in WoW, that's normal height and not rotting and having his bones stick out of his clothing.<br />
<br />
Everything else is pretty much featured -- you can play buff guys, slightly less buff guys, super buff guys, fat guys, short guys. Buff women, chubby women, skinny women, curvy women, average figure women. Just no slender or average looking male characters. <br />
<br />
I hope that when the next playable race is added, it will have a slender male. It's missing atm.</div></div><hr />

Literally everything you've mentioned require muscle endurance more so than strength, and giant tanky dudes don't have that, unless they're genetic gods.

Not a sound argument. How do any of the female characters do all this, then? Or the gnomes, goblins, undead? The answer is ~magic~ and ~fantasy~.

<br />
Orc females? :( I love their current running animation. Granted, I don't play my orc too often, but when I do, I always enjoy her running, I think it looks very cool. I'm disappointed that they've changed it for the new model, looks a lot worse now in my opinion :/ more ... rocky, less graceful.<br />

Agreed on Human males and Undead males though. I'd add Draenei males, Human females and Tauren females to the list. Oh, and most importantly, Troll females. Worst running animation of all.</div></div><hr />

true, I think they could've made the new face a little better though. looks ugly atm, and considering the original models really had no real face they could've made them decent looking without veering away from the overall human vibe. ugly beta humans vs badass looking orc model, I know where most people will be rolling come WoD</div></div><hr />

I finally figured out what bugs me about these new models though. It is the lips, something about them looks really unnatural in almost every preview i've seen. Still, really glad for the updates overall. :)</div></div><hr />

I disagree. They seem to have alot of heroic and overall distinct expressions, which is probably the best feature here. They also look kind of...british, which is basically what humans in Warcraft are based off of anyways.</div></div><hr />
