No, but if you end up buying them, you won't feel bad, at least. ;D<br />

I think I'm going to buy both. I do miss having any plushies after my friend's dog rended my old Pikachu one to death... Poor thing. :'(</div></div><hr />

You can buy just the in-game pets from the Blizzard Store, They're not on it yet but they will be soon. :)<br />
<br />

<br />
No, but if you end up buying them, you won't feel bad, at least. ;D<br />

Basically, what you are saying is that you pay for sex ? right ? if plusie cost 40$ and you give it to a girl and she gives sex, it means you pay 40$ for sex. Gg. it's cheap :)) better than dinner in town where you pay arround that figure. ..don't sex is not insured ...hahha</div></div><hr />

<br />
CAD comic was quite ok, and the things he said below the comic were quite true. Personally it doesnt affect me that much since i don't pug icc and stuff and i only have a lvl 80 with 5.8k gs, but to some ppl is sad</div></div><hr />

Hes building up a story atm, if you were reading it from the beginning it was very funny imo. :)<br />

It is a developing story, you need to follow it to understand it. That said, it is nothing for the average WoW player like yourself with the attention span of a rock.</div></div><hr />

It's why you can't ban exports to China because they make everything you export anyway.</div></div><hr />

I don't because I just assumed that they would right off the bat, but this is Blizzard, if they won't release them separately today, they will at some point. That would make more money after all.</div></div><hr />

I´ve read Teh Gladiators since ever and still dont find it funny what so ever...<br />

<br />

More money for them sure, but they wouldnt get rid of the (probably) high ammounts of plushies they have ordered :O<br />
<br />
Will just have to wait and see what they end up doing.</div></div><hr />

I bought the Pandaren Monk, but only because of the charity donations they were doing at the time. :-) It definitely gets a kick out of some people in randoms, but otherwise it's useless...wouldn't buy it now that the charity bit is over with though.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to say, but that may not happen. They said &quot;Limited time only&quot;, and while they would make more money, they will force you to buy the plushies to the get the code. just like blizzcon pets and collector's edition pets.</div></div><hr />

I would love to hear some more about what you think they should offer outside of credit cards and subscription cards from retailers. What do you want them to offer, cash or checks? Those things have ridiculous delays that would either cost Blizzard money from the delays in processing payments not to mention the extreme hassle of dealing with people mailing in payments. The only other viable option would be EFT but if you have a bank account for such a transfer you more than likely have a credit/debit card.<br />
<br />
I am really debating this purchase this time lol. Don't have a girlfriend who is interested in WoW to re-gift the stuffed animal too, although if I did it would probably be a dick move to take the in-game pet from them lol. I don't have children or any young family members I can re-gift the stuffed animals to and outside of my TY collection I keep in a box in the basement I don't really have any stuffed animals. Basically at this point I am going to have to justify this purchase by not purchasing a bottle of whiskey this weekend lol.</div></div><hr />

What other way to purchase them is there besides cards just like you can for WoW? Most major retailers carry subscription cards for WoW. I'm not sure about Wal-Mart, not that they don't carry everything, but I know Meijer's, Best Buy, etc. all carry them.<br />

What country do you live in that tax and shipping is going to tack that much on? I know there are pretty ridiculous shipping costs to some European countries. Waiting until I get home to see how much they will cost with shipping as I am at work without my authenticator.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's called the &quot;better than nothing spot&quot;, when a guild gets so skilled and geared that they could easily do the encounters with 23-24 people but they decide &quot;Hey lets bring that noob rogue to speed things along&quot; and as long as they don't pull anything they're not supposed to or stand in the fire the guild is okay with that. So when that kick-ass gear the rogue can use drops, chances are no one really needs it at that point, so rather than DE it for another shard to stick in the guild bank they give it to said rogue. Repeat this a few times, and the rogue has full ICC 25 gear, but as much skill as a pile of lumber. When the rogue later goes out and pugs, or applies for another guild everyone will be impressed with their GS, well until they see him do less DPS than the boomkin in blues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT: I don't understand people complaining about the price. These are obviously high quality, and they're HUGE (I figured they would be half the size they are when I first saw them). The pricing is very competitive when compared to other companies plush dolls. For example, Disney (who has a veritable production empire) has stuffed toys of obviously lower quality and about the same size for 20$ pre-shipping. Even bigger, these appear to be a limited run item, so I don't think 25$ is that huge, and the shipping costs are not out of line at all (the express shipping is super cheap compared to most express shipping).</div></div><hr />

There is a difference between telling a story in moderation, you know where you edit it to fit in a monthly tell ( perfect example would be the Flintlocke series) and another where you stretch a weak story thin with random stuff thrown in for the &quot;peek a boo&quot; troper thrown in.</div></div><hr />

I'm from the US as you could have guessed. An EFT system would be an effective tool for subscription fees, but I'm not sure how cost effective that would be for Blizzard. I'm sure securely storing bank information on top of the credit cards they already store would be a hassle. It probably depends on how cost effective it is for Blizzard really.<br />
<br />
And yes, not being a Euro economics major I just assumed the European banking system would have a system similar to the US in which you can get a card that is directly tied to the funds in your bank account. If that is wrong, well then screw Europe lol.<br />
