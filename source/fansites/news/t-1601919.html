Upcoming Tank Squish<br />
Changes to mob damage are still ongoing, and it's something we're hand-tuning on a dungeon-by-dungeon and boss-by-boss basis. <br />
<br />
One issue that has likely been significantly impacting the feel of tanking in dungeons and in multi-mob scenarios, is some legacy logic from 5.4 Vengeance that is no longer needed or applicable in the current tanking environment. <br />
<br />
On live in Mists, Vengeance has diminishing returns with respect to damage taken from multiple targets, because such damage proved to be much less deadly in practice than the same amount from a single source. See this post for details: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9573038382#12<br />
<br />
However, with the general increase in tank health with respect to incoming damage, and the move away from &quot;spiky&quot; damage intake, tanks spend much more time partly injured. In Mists, what killed tanks was sudden bursts of damage. In Warlords, what kills tanks is sustained damage that exceeds incoming healing and self-healing. And when it comes to sustained damage, it is immaterial whether you're being attacked by one huge enemy or many smaller enemies. <br />
<br />
Thus, we're removing any diminishing returns from Resolve when tanking multiple targets. A hotfix that makes this change should be in effect on beta within the next day. This should significantly improve survivability in dungeons and other multi-mob situations.<br />
<br />
Thanks Watcher! Is there anything the community can do further to help with the tuning? (i.e. run older dungeons at level appropriate)<br />
Being specific with your feedback, mainly. &quot;My self-healing feels weak and healers can't keep me up, this feels terrible!&quot; is valid feedback, but it's hard for us to address directly. On the other hand, &quot;I was tanking Heroic Slag Mines on my premade DK and I couldn't survive the two-ogron pull before the last boss if I didn't have all my cooldowns up. They did way more damage than any boss in the dungeon.&quot; is very actionable.<br />

<br />
Same here man. The warforged thing was ok, but gear drops are starting to turn into some kind of scratch card. Sure you won $2.50, but you're just annoyed you didn't win the $100. Warforged was good, because it was always a bonus. With these variations I'm likely gonna be pissed because I got tertiary stats instead of a gemslot or whatever.<br />
Kinda like how you FINALLY get an item on your bonus roll, but it turns out to be the most shitty option and probably something you didn't really need.<br />
<br />
If they wanted variation I would have preferred if they would have varied it based on item slot or something. E.g. Tier gear can get tertiary stats, offset items (belt/bracers/boots/cloak) can get a gem slot and weapon/neck/rings/trinkets can be warforged.<br />
Instead of these weird combinations which will just complicate things. (You'll want to take X unless Y has tertiary stats + gem slot or tertiary stats + warforged, but not if X has warforged and gem slot because than THAT is better again !)</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's a buff but this Resolve it's just a band-aid added to tanks to make them survive encounters that blizzard messed up.<br />
<br />
Resolve it's like the PvP base Resilience of 77% from MoP. That was added because players did too much damage and Bliz couldn't be bothered to balance the PvE and PvP dps. Now Blizzard comes with PvE Resilience because they can't be bothered to fix the HP/status of tanks or the dps of mobs. Cataclysm all over again...<br />

No it can be all three. What he means with &quot;max. 1 of each&quot; is that you can't get e.g. 2x gem slot.<br />
<br />
You can get an item with Warforged + Tertiary + Gemslot though (he even confirms it in the twitter post), but the chances should be low enough that you're unlikely to ever see that.</div></div><hr />

A change like this is not a band aid. &quot;band aid&quot; is not a catch all for any or every possible change and adjustment made for a classes benefit. This actually solves the damn problem in a meaningful way.<br />

actually its still a chance for any of the three, but getting more than one is rare by the very laws of RNG. &quot;one of each&quot; simply means you wont get double gems, etc.</div></div><hr />

One of the best pieces of story telling Blizzard has ever done. I felt not only bad for Maraad, but angry at the Orcs for what they did. It was very emotional, and that was awesome.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2014-10-03, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same here man. The warforged thing was ok, but gear drops are starting to turn into some kind of scratch card. Sure you won $2.50, but you're just annoyed you didn't win the $100. Warforged was good, because it was always a bonus. With these variations I'm likely gonna be pissed because I got tertiary stats instead of a gemslot or whatever.<br />
And this right here sums up perfectly all that is wrong with the concept of tertiary stats.<br />
<br />
<br />
They are moving away from certain drops being guaranteed BiS and that is a good thing.<br />
But I am way more skeptical about the gem slots...<br />
I had no problem with BiS lists for the most part because it was something to aspire to. Even though I had no chance whatsoever of obtaining heroic gear, I could say to myself, &quot;OK, I can't get that version but I know I can eventually obtain this version and figure out how to mesh it with the rest of my gear&quot;. As much as a blue once expressed disbelief that some were going for BiS in LFR gear, again, it was a goal.<br />
<br />
Now that's not to say I'm wholly against opening up a couple slots for variety, perhaps trinket for example, but I believe Blizzard's latest approach to gearing is boneheaded. Their Diablo franchise is based on the entire point of endlessly hunting for items, but this is not Diablo. Diablo III pre-RoS had a flawed design because of bleed-over from WoW -- there was a blue post that basically stated as much -- so now it looks like it's time for WoW to be reciprocated in turn.<br />

I've been missing news and scrolling down is a nightmare on this page...has there been word of when 6.0 will hit live?<br />
Blizzard stated last Thursday that PvP Season 15 would be ending in a couple weeks, so (for now) it looks like it'll be Oct 14th when Patch 6.0.2 goes live.</div></div><hr />

Perfect. Because &quot;the healer fucked up&quot; wasn't already number 1 excuse.</div></div><hr />

Nice. Now when the tanks dies because we still need to heal the raid more because people didn't run out of the fire, people will complain more and more.<br />
<br />
Also: this never worked: they said exactly the same in Cata: The damage was the same as in WotLK (percentual) but the heal was bad. When in Warlords 50% of healers quit, wait for a patch or two and blizzard buff the heals again by 37% and decrease pvp-healing again! Slower healing is boring or it's too hard to heal.</div></div><hr />

They said this for WotLK, Cataclysm and MoP.</div></div><hr />
