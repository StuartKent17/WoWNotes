The Blizzard Store (http://www.blizzard.com/store/) is now officialy open in the US. We already talked about it a few days ago (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=7061.0) but a lot of users were experiencing bugs with registrations. We can assume that most of the bugs are now fixed and we'll probably see the store available in Europe very soon. <br />
We are proud to announce the release of the brand-new Blizzard Store! Completely redesigned from the ground up, the Blizzard Store allows you to purchase Blizzard Entertainment games and other merchandise directly from the source. Here are some of the features of the new Blizzard Store:<br />
User-friendly interface makes your shopping fast and convenient.<br />

Convenient online shopping tools such as saving payment methods and shipping addresses for future reference.<br />
Digital downloads: now you can purchase select Blizzard Entertainment titles as direct downloads, with immediate access upon payment.<br />
Purchase World of Warcraft game time for yourself or for a friend.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoy the new Blizzard Store (http://www.blizzard.com/store/)! <br />

Official forums avatars &amp; rogues<br />
Woops! I meant T5, but yeah rogues are in T4, maybe the web artists thought T5 was too dark/bland to set the icons apart. In any case your armory is a click away so I wouldn't worry about a forum icon too much. Before Lich King comes out I'm betting there will be new icons for level 80 and everyone will be in Tier 7. We have no plans to update the icons before that time. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=6286802685&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#6))<br />

<br />
Yes, the CoD4 clanbase ruleset.<br />
<br />
You find me a better ruleset that keeps the game fair. The only one that comes close is ESL and ESL is a complete joke.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with CB anyway, disagree and you're an elitist asshole. CB has a nice tight community full of great people who may not be the best at gaming but they sure know how to have fun. Plus it's one of the oldest eSports websites with some old school gamers who i've met and played with for over 7 years.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, you are probably one of those kids who haven't played many games competitively and are angry that your one game CoD4 hasn't got picked up by a large tournament company such as MLG. It's obvious you haven't done much research or even played the games that MLG has on their circuit. Anything, yes &quot;anything&quot; could be extremely skillful at the top level, again you would know this if you actually played more than one game.<br />
<br />
eSports vets like myself laugh at fake eSport vets that think they know everything and make idiotic comments like the ones above</div></div><hr />

Well, you do know that most games that have auto-aim can also have that option TURNED OFF. Simple rule change opens up a variety of games for MLG to support.<br />
<br />
Not really much of an eSport vet I'd say...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nop, it shouldn't change in the near future and that's why I never took the time to make it public, MLG mostly took control of all the technical stuff (that's why the site stopped crashing on patch days ^^) but I'm still in charge of 90% of the site. <br />
<br />
However, I might recruit a few people at some point to help with the news with the upcoming WotLK beta. ^^</div></div><hr />

Because I would have closed it if I didn't have the technical and financial backup from MLG at some point. ^^<br />

Anyway, without Esport MLG probably wouldn't have been that much interested in MMO-Champ and this site would probably be offline by now, this was what I meant. To be honest as a webmaster I was really happy to work with a gaming league instead of selling to ... bah, you know who they are. ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I was reffering to consoles, console FPS's take no skill at all. They're low skill 1 shot shooters with auto-aim that a 5 year old can pick up and be &quot;pro&quot; in about 2 hours after learning the controls.<br />

m8, i've been playing games competitivly since QuakeWorld was released, i know the eSports scene and players far greater than anyone else here. I've watched this scene grow and now it's growing into something that it shouldn't. I can respect StarCraft / Warcraft players, but not WoW or console shooters.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you could answer something I've been wondering ever since I first stumbled upon the site. If its called mmo-champion (fairly generic), why is WoW essentially the only game covered? I'm not complaining by any means, and are there any plans to change that? One would expect a &quot;warcrafty&quot; name.</div></div><hr />

Dang, whatever will the professional gamers do without your respect?<br />

Seriously though, the way you're whining about this shit makes it seem like you think they don't know what they are doing. If you think that's true, you are dumb and have learned nothing as a self-proclaimed &quot;vet&quot;. It should be fairly obvious that the main (only?) reason companies bother sponsoring people and arranging tours is to advertise their shit and get more money back then they spend on it. WoW is as popular as the slutty chick in high school and even tho you think the goth chick in the corner has more depth, you're not gonna make people stop staring at those firm hooters. This analogy sort of went to a weird place.. Anyways money rules the world and if you're gonna bitch about it I hope you at least realise that they know what they are doing and aren't gonna change jack shit because of how much &quot;skill&quot; is needed.</div></div><hr />
