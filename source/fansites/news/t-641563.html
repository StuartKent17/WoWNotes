Updated PTR Schedule - 31/03<br />
Here's the current schedule for Ulduar PTR testing:<br />
<br />
On the North American test realms:<br />
[b]Hodir (Hard Mode) - Tuesday Night, March 31, starting at 7pm EDT/4pm PDT.<br />
We've made some adjustments to the NPC mechanics in an effort to better balance the ability for melee and ranged players to do damage.<br />
<br />
Iron Council (Hard Mode) - Wednesday Night, April 1, starting at 7pm EDT/4pm PDT.<br />
We'd like Steelbreaker last tested again, we have Static Disruption working again.<br />
<br />
On the European test realms:<br />
General Vezax (Hard Mode) - Wednesday Night, April 1 at 19:00 CET.<br />
We've made further adjustments to try and balance the the effectiveness of ranged DPS casters and melee in the fight.<br />
<br />
For Hard Mode testing, Shirts of Uber will be available on Ursula McWeaksauce to help simulate a raid having obtained Ulduar gear. Check the entrance area of Ulduar for the vendor.<br />
<br />
This schedule could change at a moment's notice due to server, bug, or patch status. I'll try to keep everyone informed as much as possible. Ulduar and the bosses to be tested will remain also open a variable length of time. How long they stay open depends upon a host of factors including designer availability, bug status, etc.<br />
<br />
We're very interested in seeing combat logs and parses for all raid testing on the PTR.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshmello</div><div class="date">2009-03-31, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing, since the only bosses for testing this week are hard mode bosses, that all the normal encounters are properly tuned? Which means we may see this patch go live as early as next week! ;D</div></div><hr />

&lt;edit&gt; Or maybe not, looks like just one of the achievements<br />

&lt;edit 2&gt; From Stratfu:<br />

<br />
Hard Modes<br />
<br />
If you kill him in under 3 minutes for 2 &quot;Rare Runed Chest&quot; loots.<br />
<br />
If you kill him in under 6 minutes for 1 &quot;Rare Runed Chest&quot; loot.<br />
<br />
Enrage is 9 mins (when he destroys the third chest.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This certainly wasn't the case before, it was just a (still noticeable if you're alert) &quot;cloud&quot; effect, where the icicle was about to fall.</div></div><hr />

Has his whole table already been discovered or did the hot shot guilds just not report back what they got? To be honest I don't know how you discover what all these guilds got to drop but I am surprised I'm not seeing anything new.</div></div><hr />
