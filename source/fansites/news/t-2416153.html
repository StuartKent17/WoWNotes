Zul, Reborn<br />
Once the proud leader of the Zanchuli Council, highest advisors to the kings of Zandalar, Zul was praised as the greatest of prophets. Now, the dark prophet has turned on King Rastakhan and would see a true troll empire rule the world once again, even if it means submitting to the blood god: G'huun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overview - Zul begins the encounter assisted by the Forces of Blood. He will continue to summon additional Forces of Blood that the party must contend with while his energy fills. At 40% health, Zul no longer summons the Forces of Blood and becomes fully empowered with the Blood of G'huun, unleashing Locus of Corruption (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/274168-locus-of-corruption), spending his Elder Blood to afflict the raid with Corrupted Blood (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/274195-corrupted-blood) for the remainder of the encounter. Players must defeat him before the damage from Corrupted Blood (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/274195-corrupted-blood) overwhelms them.<br />
<br />
Tanks - Nazmani Crushers use Thrumming Pulse (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/273288-thrumming-pulse) when their energy is full. Make sure they are not within range of their allies!<br />
Avoid melee attacks from Bloodthirsty Crawgs or use defensive abilities to reduce their healing from Hungering Maw (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/273254-hungering-maw).<br />
Rupturing Blood (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/274358-rupturing-blood) will create a large area of Ruptured Blood (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/274363-ruptured-blood) when it wears off - make sure you are far away from other players!<br />
Healers - Dark Revelation (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/273365-dark-revelation) and Deathwish (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/274271-deathwish) deal high group damage.<br />
Dispel Deathwish (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/274271-deathwish) before players leap to their deaths!<br />
Once Zul casts Locus of Corruption (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/274168-locus-of-corruption), the group will begin taking constrant damage for the remainder of the encounter.<br />
Damage Dealers - Move away from the party when afflicted by Dark Revelation (https://beta.wowdb.com/spells/273365-dark-revelation).<br />

<br />
Mob Scaling Changes<br />
We've just applied a hotfix that reduces the damage dealt by creatures between level 1 and 100 by up to 16%, and reduces their health by up to 24%. Until a subsequent fix (targeted for next week) to update clients with the new data, unit frames may not reflect the change in creature health, but combat should be faster and a bit less lethal across the board while leveling. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your patience - we'll continue to monitor both logs and feedback closely, and will make further tweaks if needed.<br />

You can still enjoy it!. No need to steamroll everything (it's not fun, I agree). Just unequip your gear and fight mobs while naked. Killing bosses will take much more time and the sense of pride and accomplishment will be back, once again :-)</div></div><hr />

Well, I find cinematic Anduin extremely ugly. His in-game model looks much better. This whiny child is the new high king of the Alliance? Give me a break, and give me Varian back.

But having an image of Anduin where people (I don't know why) decided to call him a crybaby, and give him a tiny quote - then have Sylvanas (who, for some reason, look like a girl who is really cross with her mother for not giving her what she wants) with a much longer, more interesting quote... It's like they are catching on that people don't like Lady Morallynas Greyrunner. &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />

Raid bosses are kind of outside of any spoiler territory, since people need to know how to do the fights beforehand. If there's a cutscene or something, sure, that can be a spoiler. But the fact that a boss exists is not a spoiler. Also, the game itself tells you who the bosses are if you look at the dungeon journal at any time, so it's not like Blizzard tries to hide it either.</div></div><hr />

I'm not really sure there's a more entitled group online than the NO SPOILZ!!!!!!!!!!!! crowd.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On another note,<br />
<br />
I love all the hemming and hawing and hand-wringing and fancy explanations for the old content overbuff--and then subsequent scaling back, scaling back, using the same method they said they couldn't just use before.<br />
<br />
Proves:<br />
1) They could scale back the mobs, they just didn't want to<br />
2) Overwhelming negative feedback, which was there when changes were announced (and for 7.3.5 too!) and they ignored because it didn't fit &quot;the team's&quot; goals.<br />
<br />
Next time spare us the lengthy excuses and just nerf the mobs. Or, you know, don't buff old/dated content to arbitrarily extend the level up experience under the guise of a whole load of bs reasons in the first place. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
AND FINALLY:<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand as one for the Alliance!&quot; - He cried out, as if Alliance hasn't been boring get-along-pals Mary-sues since Vanilla with the sole exception of dwarfs having a pissing contest during Cata...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ours is a cycle of hatred-&quot; -She forsakensplained, standing as a pillar of hypocrisy and authoritarian malice. HMM I WONDER WHY.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 - They never said they &quot;can't&quot; just scale the numbers. They said they don't want to since there is an UNDERLYING issue with the scaling tech. Since they can't find it, they scaled the numbers down. When they fix it, they will scale them back (but you won't even notice since the issue will be fixed)<br />
<br />
2 - The leveling experience is currently same as 7.3.5 bar the 80-90 bracket, which was nerfed, since it was actually slower then 90-100.</div></div><hr />

Well the ingame Anduin looks like he is in his mid-late twenties, when he should look like he is 18. He does in the cinematic.<br />
He actually looks like a young Brad Pitt and it fits him perfectly imo.<br />

Make sure to report the mobs and your level whenever you encounter this. The hotfix is just a bandaid while they investigate the issue, as they haven't been able to determine where the root cause is yet. There is apparently some unidentified or undocumented variable that they failed to find or account for when implementing the squish.<br />

&quot;Until a subsequent fix (targeted for next week) to update clients with the new data, unit frames may not reflect the change in creature health, but combat should be faster and a bit less lethal across the board while leveling. &quot;</div></div><hr />

First Raid tanks back to 2M HP - and by 2nd Raid +1000 stats again... It just feels like reaching a goal of 100k HP meant something as a tank back in the day. Reaching that crit block chance meant something on your character, and it made a difference.</div></div><hr />

1: orcs are the main face of the horde<br />
2: vanilla, tbc, wrath, mists and legion had next to nothing to do with orcs. And cata is an exception since thrall was the main hero there.<br />
3: Legion was all about elves and draenei, and the final patch had no horde characters involved in the attack on argus.<br />
<br />
So check your facts next time.</div></div><hr />

TBC had 3 dungeons full of orcs, Wrath had an entire zone of Trolls, Mists had SIEGE OF ORGRIMMAR and Throne of Thunder. I mean I don't have an issue with a troll raid here, but it is a pretty common foe we face.</div></div><hr />

Ohh really? They NEED to know it beforehand? I'm sure there are a lot of people who like to go in fresh and learn fights on their own. Well, people of quality does. The rest of the crowd just wants instant gratification and experience no challenge if possible. When you're late in an expansion and join something as a tank, well, then i somewhat agree that it's a shitty thing to go in new and clueless, but when it's new content then it's fun to learn together. Try it for a change.</div></div><hr />

Why would it need a warning? Blizz literally put his existence as a boss into in-game guides months before Uldir even opens.</div></div><hr />

In theory the HP was reduced, but we would still see the old HP, like it was a glitch. A mob would display having 4k HP, but would in theory have something like 3.7k, and dealing 3.7k damage should kill it. However, I've been checking my logs for every creature I kill, and the damage I dealt always matched the HP displayed. It's not an UI/unit frames issue.</div></div><hr />

Cinematic Anduin is awesome. He hasn't been a whiny child since the beginning of Legion. It wasn't Genn's choice at Broken Shore. He offered Varian a hand to hoist him back up on the ship, but Varian gave him a message for Anduin instead and chose to sacrifice himself. I have never understood the thought that Genn is awful for hating Sylvanas while everyone forgets she killed his son. Of course he hates her. Wouldn't you in his place?</div></div><hr />

Heh, ok. There are guilds out there that go in blind, but that is definitely the minority. Most raiders will prepare beforehand, and a lot of raiding guilds will require that you do so. Sorry that's not to your liking, but that's how the game is. I'm glad you were able to find a group of like-minded individuals.<br />
Also note that I never said anything about going in blind being a bad thing. You're the one coming in with the rude remarks.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry, not all people have to get everything served on a silver platter. Back in vanilla we still had to find stuff out ourselves even if this meant wiping countless times. No watching other guilds already clearing the raids on PTR.<br />
<br />
I don't really get people that say you have to know all encounters before stepping into a raid. It's boring to read boss abilities beforehand and compares to reading a walkthrough for single player games before playing them, so you don't miss anything in the first playthrough.</div></div><hr />
