A few changes were made to Lunar Festival (http://www.wowpedia.org/Lunar_Festival) this year, with two faction specific pets being added and new Elders for you to visit in the Cataclysm zones. You can find a list of the Elder's locations on Wowpedia (http://www.wowpedia.org/Lunar_Festival_Elders).<br />

<br />
The new Lunar Lantern (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/74610/lunar-lantern/) and Festival Lantern (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/74611/festival-lantern/) are new rewards from the Lunar Festival (http://www.wowpedia.org/Lunar_festival). The new Lunar Lantern (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/74610/lunar-lantern/) would be the Alliance version and the Festival Lantern (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/74611/festival-lantern/) the Horde one. Each costs Coin of Ancestry (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/21100/coin-of-ancestry/) x 50 from the vendor.<br />

Every year the druids of Moonglade hold a celebration of their city’s great triumph over an ancient evil. During the Lunar Festival, citizens of Azeroth have the opportunity to honor their elders by celebrating their sage wisdom, sharing in magnificent feasts, and of course…shooting fireworks!<br />
<br />
The Lunar Festival returns to Azeroth in a cascade of pyrotechnics on Sunday, January 22! With the start of a new year, elders of generations past manifest around the world to impart their wisdom upon all who would listen. Should you encounter these venerable spirits in your travels and take the time to heed their wisdom, they may even pass along tokens of their gratitude -- Coins of Ancestry, the lessons of a past age in physical form. Gather enough of these Coins of Ancestry and the Cenarion Circle will open to you their stores of celebratory fireworks, trinkets, garbs, and recipes!<br />
<br />
The Cenarion Circle have even more cause to celebrate this year than any previous, for this year also marks the first Lunar Festival since the return of many Ancients that had fallen in battles past: Goldrinn, Malorne, Aviana, and Cenarius himself. But this celebration is muted by the eternal torment of one of their own -- Omen, blessed by the moon goddess Elune, has risen again from the depths of Moonglade’s lake. Driven mad by the Burning Legion’s tainted magics during the War of the Ancients, Elune’s blessing of immortality means that he will forever be cursed to return in his maddened state at the advent of a new year. Heroes are called to help ease this tormented Ancient’s suffering, in the hopes that perhaps next year will see him return with a clearer mind.<br />
<br />
Lunar Festivities end Sunday, February 12.<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
Hard drives remain expensive, so now is still a good time to buy a SSD, as the next generation is a while away and the current prices are fairly flat (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/january/ssdgraph.gif), with sales bringing the cost very close to $1 per gigabyte. <br />
<br />
AMD's Bulldozer arrived to negative reviews (http://www.anandtech.com/show/4955/the-bulldozer-review-amd-fx8150-tested), citing excessive power usage and heat output and very poor single threaded performance. The previously mentioned patches for Windows are now available (http://blogs.amd.com/play/2012/01/11/early-results-achieved-with-amd-fx-processor-using-windows%C2%AE-7-scheduler-update/) and give a few percent performance increase. (Patch 1 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2646060), Patch 2 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2645594))<br />
<br />
New CPUs from Intel should be arriving in early April if you aren't in a hurry to build, bringing increased performance and lower power consumption. <br />
<br />
The new 7970 GPU from AMD has been released and can be had for ~$550 if you can find it in stock. The 7950 will be here in a matter of weeks somewhere in the low ~$400 price range. More GPUs will likely be released next month. New GPUs from Nvidia likely won't be here before early March. <br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

It seems that the redesigning of several towns/zones has placed the Elders in way more precarious spots for cross-faction collection. Hell, the Razor Hill/Vendetta Point Elders are standing almost right beside the Flight Master, and what with everything spawning level 85 guards ... eeeesh. Fortunately I've already got the title on my druid from last year, so if I do anything it'll be half-heartedly grinding coins for a lantern ... that I'll be saving for my pandas. (What? Don't judge me!) To add: holy shit that female night elf TCG artwork is badaaaaaass. Finally, a correct portrayal of dem crazy Amazonian warrior-wimmenz.</div></div><hr />

Seems like whenever I see the Build of the Month posted it's all just people bitching about what's wrong with it. Well, I just built my own computer from scratch for the first time, mostly relying on Chaud's list (and doing a little googling to verify compatibilities - don't get tall memory chips if you get that MASSIVE Noctua cooler!), and once I actually got the memory chips seated right, it's up and running and WoW is 100-200FPS at ultra settings instead of 13FPS at low settings. And this was probably the cheapest computer I've ever had. I'll be building more in the future for sure, and this is a great resource. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

You can do Crossfire or SLI, but generally you are better off buying just one card to start with. Anything more is overkill for most people. <br />

<br />
They are vastly overstating the requirements. The total draw for that system would be less than 300W. (The 6770 is the same card as the 5770 in the below charts)<br />

<br />
IPS panels are great for many things, but gaming isn't one of them. Sure, they are becoming faster and faster, but mainly IPS panels aren't for gaming. Also, for gaming, getting the 2600K over 2500K is not justifiable. Not even a bit.<br />
<br />
When it comes to SLI or Crossfire, it can actually be a very good decision depending on which manufacturer and which generation of cards one is planning on spending on. For example, in some certain price ranges, getting a Crossfire setup was clearly THE choice with AMD 6xxx series. This will probably be the case with 7xxx series too, after the whole lineup has formed itself later this year.</div></div><hr />

Wow, the razer black widow claimed to be better than the logitech G110? What the fuck. Did they even look at the keyboard after razer bribed them to list it there?<br />
<br />
Original price is $50 more for the razer, for what? Less features, less buttons... Not worth it.The g110 is an absolutely marvelous keyboard.<br />
<br />
And if you want to talk about the keys itself, the g110 is wonderful to type and play games with, and you can hold a shitload of keys at the same time and they are all recognized.<br />
<br />
The BlackWidow is just a mechanical switches keyboard option, whereas the G110 doesn't have those switches. It is priced fairly reasonably compared to other options and holds up well for the cost. <br />
<br />
I don't have any &quot;deals&quot; with any companies when it comes to making the list, thanks for your feedback!<br />
<br />

<br />
People doing this kind of setups are horrid. Z68 motherboard for i3-2100... instead of cheaper H61/H67 one. Monitors without comment. Look for Dell U2312M or Dell U2412M<br />
<br />
The U2412M has some nasty reverse ghosting and high response times, the ZR24w has lower times and is acceptable for anything that isn't high motion FPS games or for people that are super sensitive to ghosting. It also has better color at default settings. <br />
<br />
The Z68 is selected so that a user can drop in an Ivy Bridge chip (hopefully) in the future and overclock. A P67 alternative would save an insignificant amount of money.</div></div><hr />

- XFX 6770: why recommend a card that is known to run loud and hot when you can get the Asus model for the same price?<br />

- XFX 6970: the Sapphire model is $5 cheaper. The HIS IceQ (http://www.amazon.com/HIS-Radeon-Mini-DisplayPort-Express-H697QT2G2M/dp/B0056G66LA/ref=sr_1_24?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327285383&amp;sr=1-24) model is $5 more expensive and far superior.<br />
<br />
- Razer Blackwidow: the worst of the lot. If somebody is going to appreciate a mechanical keyboard, then they should get a real one. If they aren't they should get a non-mechanical keyboard for less money, and one that isn't likely to stop working or trigger keys you aren't pressing or press down the alt keys when you press the space bar. Hell, even a keyboard without that stupid lettering design on the keys would be an improvement. Besides which, Razer have put blue switches in the blackwidow because they care more about the appearance of being &quot;elite&quot; and constantly reminding the user that they have special keys, instead of actually using a switch that would be beneficial to gaming such as red, black or even brown switches.</div></div><hr />

Far superior is a significant stretch. I am exploring alternatives for Puppy and Dolphin PSUs though, Amazon significantly increased prices compared to last list. <br />
<br />
The same thing happened to the backlit version of the keyboard, price went up. If it were a full list I could include the Meka G1 or 6Gv2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Far superior is a significant stretch.Call it a matter of opinion, but it is still a better card whichever way you put it, and given this is supposed to be the best of the 4 systems and you're already spending $325 on the gpu, there's no real reason not to pay another $5 for something better and not have to worry about a rebate.</div></div><hr />

I was able to ride around and do all the Midsummer fire collecting/dousing on my alt last year-- leaving only Ahune and King of the Festival for this year. The Extinguishing the Alliance/Horde achievement is still showing as completed for me but Cata/NR are greyed out-- I assume they will be part of the meta now as well. I need to see if I still have coins on my other characters. I don't plan to go around collecting them again but it might be worthwhile to try and sell the pet.</div></div><hr />

It happened to me on my Night Elf Druid (I had one achievement to go, and now technically two since the Cata ones were added to the Meta) and I opened a ticket. Got a response in about a minute and the GM told me that they are working to fix the bug.</div></div><hr />

Used to be that the comp of the month didn't even have a &quot;set name&quot;. Then, I think, some made a joke about having it labeled unicorn or pony.<br />

My wife bought me one for my birthday in May. First keyboard was DOA, replaced by newegg a few days later. Second keyboard the left control key stuck down every 10 key strokes. Replaced by newegg. Third keyboard the spacebar stuck against the right alt key. Replaced by newegg. Fourth keyboard was bent/molded incorrectly, and when placed on a desk it wobbled like a table with a broken leg. Newegg wouldn't replace, outside of the return window. Razer finally sent a replacement keyboard almost 3 weeks after having received my defective one. That keyboard was obviously refurbed, and was DOA. Sent it back, 3 weeks later I finally got another one. This one appeared to be working fine for about a month, then the LED under the 1/END key on the number pad died. This was a minor (although annoying and unaccepable for $130 keyboard) problem, so I dealt with it. I plugged my thumbdrive into the USB hub on the side for the first time, lights started to flicker, then finally went out.Razer then told me they would not longer be accepting returns, because &quot;three keyboards for one user&quot; was outside their policy for returns.I sold the keyboard on Craigslist as defective for $60, went back to using the Illuminated Logitech Keyboard that I had intended to replace, because after 3 years the finish was starting to wear off.My Razer Mamba has also been having intermittent issues where the mouse will only move up/down or left/right and no other direction until it's banged on the desk. The mouse wheel also rattled/squeeked out of the box.Never again will I buy their products. Poor quality control, even worse customer servce.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I had the 6970 from HIS and it was loud as hell, so changed it for an XFX 6970 reference blower design (the only manufacturer I could find with reference coolers that were in stock or available in the next 2 weeks) - heaven. <br />
<br />
Might have to say, that I'm running a mini-ITX setup, so the air is getting hotter as usual inside the case, and thus when the HIS blower revs up it's annoyingly loud compared to the reference blower design, the HIS keeps it a tad cooler, but I'm still content with the temperatures I'm getting right now. The card just idles at 63-65C and goes to 79-85C under load with auto settings on the fan which comes to about 35%, with manual setting it to 45-50% area (which is still quieter compared to the HIS at whatever RPM it was), I get to sink the temps under load to about 69-75C and around 48-51C in idle, but I'm not doing that and keeping it at default auto RPM settings.</div></div><hr />

You are really wrong here my friend. It was true back them, but as for today the IPS technology improved a lot. Read some tests about them. You can start with the masterpiece I mentioned above, it worth to take a look. Really.</div></div><hr />

It also has better color at default settings. <br />
money.<br />
<br />
Except that Dell has lower input lag than most top end TN's. All those super hyper 2ms monitors are gray to gray what is a meaningless since how many games are completly gray entire time?<br />
<br />
HP vs Dell <br />
Its cheaper for the same job done.</div></div><hr />

then people like you are part of the problem. 50 coins for a fucking pet? seriously? i think i have 12 from the last 3 yrs of this stupid 'holiday' If it was something more tangible i might be bothered to run around the different continents to out of the way places to click on a mob to give me either a cluster of useles =250 health fireworks or a stone to put a pilliar of light on the ground. but i DO have the lantern that lets me make my own stone of light. on a cooldwon thats far too long to be of any real fun.

<br />
When it comes to SLI or Crossfire, it can actually be a very good decision depending on which manufacturer and which generation of cards one is planning on spending on. For example, in some certain price ranges, getting a Crossfire setup was clearly THE choice with AMD 6xxx series. This will probably be the case with 7xxx series too, after the whole lineup has formed itself later this year.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you aren't using more than one video feed how much of a boost is going SLI in gaming?</div></div><hr />
