Wierd... Because pre 7.3.5 I could pull 7-10 mobs and just nuke them all down without ever dropping below 80% hp, now I get 3-4 mobs on me and unless Im playing a tank or healer, I'm pretty darn dead. (With the exception of some specs that for some reason has both insane burst and survivabilty compared to others of the same level, fury warrior for example).<br />

Most of the people who arrive to end game after leveling, which does not require you to play your class even at 10% of it's potetial are just trash, because the game does not encourage players to get better while leveling. Harder leveling is better for the game imo.<br />

It isn't hard by any means, but it's far and beyond more challenging than pre-7.3.5 was. What &quot;real&quot; MMO are you comparing to? I can't think of any MMO that's still alive that wasn't even easier to level in than WoW was back in the day. I mean, since you say &quot;never&quot;.<br />

Definitely wrong - more boring leveling will make people leave the game. WoW leveling hasn't been anything you can call hard for many years now (even back then it was a bit of a stretch).<br />
<br />
Blizzard made the 7.3.5 change because they thought leveling being more engaging would increase player retention, and nothing else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say that almost no standard MMORPG's leveling is challenging. They just have varying degrees of grind, and restrictions on how that grind can play out, how many people are needed for said level grind, and the degrees of punishment for failing to know what buttons are for attacking and what buttons are for healing.<br />
<br />
Time and knowing what buttons to hit to make the health bar go down. That's the entire challenge. <br />
<br />
They don't even have real AI.</div></div><hr />

Pfft, try power leveling an alt through FFXIV's mandatory story quest chain which includes long pauses at every past level cap as you play through each xpacs content patch story content. Content that includes all instanced group content short of raids. All mandatory to reach the current end game. <br />

Didn't they hotfix it? Check it out again, the settings often resets, it seems to be similiar to what it was before the patch, at least when it comes to NPCs, haven't checked other objects.<br />

Technically it could be both. They could still make challenging mobs that take a while to kill and even have ability or two to deal with, but also reduce the exp required so that it doesn't take several days to level up an alt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone is just painting with too broad of a brush.<br />
<br />
It's &quot;hard to level now&quot; (or was) solely because it took longer. Not that killing the mobs is hard or that the content is challenging. Or that's what I've picked up. That's why I agree with everyone who says Blizzard didn't make it more challenging, they just made it more tedious.<br />
<br />
They could make the content more challenging and reward more XP, thus making it better for everyone. The leveling doesn't take longer, but it becomes more challenging. Reward = effort. Somewhat similar to what they did with rares in MoP, just maybe not as extreme on the XP gain.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ElDoorO</div><div class="date">2018-07-31, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because the tedium drives off new players leveling for the first time just as much as veteran players.<br />
<br />
Yup. Wife stopped playing when she realized just how long it'd take to hit max level or to get to content I could actually do something with her.<br />
Our only other alternative was to ONLY play when the other was on so I'd be able to run with her.<br />
She lost interest and never made it to level 11. 110 levels looks quite painful when you're brand new. It only gets worse when you realize that everything she does is worthless when she hits max level.When I explained that level 1-109 is basically a &quot;pre-game&quot; to play the real game she pretty much lost all interest. Sure, at level 100 she could start doing some profession stuff and somewhere near that I could run a few dungeons with her but, sadly, those dungeons don't net much experience unless you have the quests.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard hadn't had gone full retard and nerfed the power leveling as hard as they did she might have been interested. But, ya know, they have to weed out the players for some reason. I wonder if they are secretly masochists.<br />
<br />
I'd be curious to know how many people quit purely because of leveling and not being able to play with their friends because of that.<br />

Pfft, try power leveling an alt through FFXIV's mandatory story quest chain which includes long pauses at every past level cap as you play through each xpacs content patch story content. Content that includes all instanced group content short of raids. All mandatory to reach the current end game. <br />
<br />
Now kiss your heirlooms and promise to never argue again.<br />
<br />
Just because FFXIV is bad doesn't make WoW good. It's not like WoW is in its prime anymore either...</div></div><hr />

Honest question, is there really a need for Alts in FFXIV since your character can do everything? Sorry, haven't played in awhile, but thought you could always change specs and level another job?</div></div><hr />

That is admittedly true, yes. The only real reasons to roll alts are if you want to play another race or for rp reasons.<br />

I didn't say all that. Sometimes it's nice to play something that takes itself seriously. I keep a copy of Encyclopedia Eorzea next to my stack of Warcraft Chronicles</div></div><hr />

Because pre 7.3.5 I could pull 7-10 mobs and just nuke them all down without ever dropping below 80% hp, now I get 3-4 mobs on me and unless Im playing a tank or healer, I'm pretty darn dead. (With the exception of some specs that for some reason has both insane burst and survivabilty compared to others of the same level, fury warrior for example).<br />

... Because it's a MMORPG, they were never easy. WoW made it more approachable and then they nerfed the shit out of the game and lost near 50% of their playerbase, only now do I see friends returning when there is a challange both during level and at endgame. Is the game challanging for veterans and heirloomed up groups? Not really, I mean you CAN die, but it's unlikely. But for new people it most certainly is, and it should be.<br />
<br />
<br />
A braindead easy leveling experiance is just dull and boring, especially when there are 110 levels to gain. It's far better than how it was.<br />
<br />
Nothing of what you described in your first paragraph is a challenge. It's just &quot;You pull 1 mob to many, you're dead&quot;. That's not a challenge, that's just boring gameplay.<br />
<br />
And boring gameplay is, honestly, pretty much the entire point. I love the stories in wow, i've done loremaster twice over, but leveling gameplay is boring and tedious, no matter how you slice, redesign, or rebalance it. I want to do the quests, at least some of them, even though i've already done them, but i don't want to have my access to endgame and actual challenges locked away behind 100 hours of questing or dungeon spam.<br />
At this point, they need to either dramatically reduce the amount of time/xp that is required to reach max level, or implement a level squish. Make classic content 1-30, every expansion adds 5 levels. That would put us at 65 come bfa, which is a lot more bearable, even at the current, or even a slower, leveling speed, than fucking 120.</div></div><hr />

What a difference. I was not spam healing, I could dps from time to time, normal pull was not asking me my 100% so we didn't wipe when we pulled 2-3 groups that one time. It's was finally enjoyable. And 75% of my level for less then 30 minutes run is perfect. Botanica for a reference.<br />
<br />
and still not a joke like 100-110 dungeon... A couple of renewing mist was more then enough, I was dpsing most of the time... Darkheart Ticket here.</div></div><hr />

Rushing Jade Wind will toggle off if the player has not auto-attacked any target for one minute.<br />
