<br />
The design called for &quot;phosphorescent mushrooms, reminiscent of Zangarmarsh,&quot; so our main concern was avoiding making a helm that looked like a giant toadstool sombrero. Weâ€™re always looking to incorporate interesting light sources within a raid set, and bioluminescent vegetable growth certainly provides that. Twisting, organic shapes are often key elements of a druid set, and this tier is no exception, with writhing plant roots providing a frame for the glowing clusters of fungi.<br />

Back on topic. I like. Fairly basic, but it's nice all the same. Good colour scheme.<br />

This looks like every other Druid set. Boring. ...aaaand there's this. Of course you can't please anyone, so it's a given that whatever Blizzard rolls out, there will be complaints that it's either &quot;too generic&quot;, &quot;sick of themed sets already&quot;, or &quot;doesn't look like a druid set at all!&quot;. C'est la vie!</div></div><hr />

I think the problem with druid sets is that blizzard is having a hard time defining what a &quot;druidish&quot; look is. At least that's the way I see it, druid sets seem to be all over the place in terms of inspiration and concepts.</div></div><hr />

When i think of druids, I think of Animals, Nature and Stars / Moon. I dont think it be to hard to think of somthing around that really... Could be somthing to do with the world tree or somthing. <br />
<br />

It's kind of a mushroom theme which is great but the helm is nearly just plain green mask that doesn't even look that good. I think it need some more stuff on it like the last tier we got. (Tier 12.)</div></div><hr />

Tier 1, 5, 6 are the best looking sets, T8 n T11 have nice shoulders at least.<br />

At least the colours dont look as ridiculous as the warlock set. I guess it's inspired by the earthen ring or something earth related, but Im not sure about that.

I've mained my druid since I started playing WoW almost 7 years ago and not too many of the tier sets stick to the fundamentals and core of the druid class and lore. Druids aren't gaudy and flashy people. Druids are simple in their way of life and mannerisms and that is exactly what this set represents. If you wanted some gaudy and flashy tier than roll a paladin or a mage or a shaman at times. I'm really glad to see a druid tier that is simple and yet core to the druid look and style that is in the lore. Having worn 4/5 or 5/5 and 7/8 or 8/8 of all of the tier sets at one time or another I'm excited about this tier and I can't wait to see what they release for some other classes.</div></div><hr />

I agree. The shroom shoulders raise an eyebrow, but overall, the design and color scheme are well done. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silarn</div><div class="date">2011-09-13, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a unified design, the set is very strong. I don't see one area or angle where the set looks out of place or lacking in detail. It all works together extremely well, which is why I personally like the set a lot. That being said, there are a couple points that are going to disappoint different sets of people.<br />
<br />
A) No clear theme. Lots of armors, particularly in the last few tiers, were clearly built around some concept. Beyond having druidy colorations, nothing jumps out as being a primary theme here. (vis-a-vis &quot;omg this is a pvp set&quot;) B) No animated, roaring bear heads on the shoulders. Some people just aren't happy unless their sets have &quot;major wow factor&quot;. (&quot;I sure hope those mushrooms glow&quot;) C) Some people aren't happy if anything is like anything ever done before. Ever. Thus, because the set incorporates a hood and large stitched areas, it is just a copy of set x, y, and b.</div></div><hr />

I like the marshy shoulders and high res. details on the chest. Nice, simple, and I believe its the 1st marsh themed Tier set for druids from what I see. (the back of the armor looks best.) :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">druidiful</div><div class="date">2011-09-13, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The color scheme is nice for the set, but it just seems as if the shoulders are a little too flat, just a straight line down from the head. The helm just looks like a reskinned Alliance tier 9 helm with a some mushrooms.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lumineus</div><div class="date">2011-09-13, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Feels kind of uninspired, IMO. But then, I feel that way about most leather tier. FWIW, I still think it's the best Druid set since T4.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neurotoxinx</div><div class="date">2011-09-13, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The shoulders are cool looking, upon realizing those are mushrooms which is actually kind of cute, but I don't like the rest of the set much. I just dislike the dark mushy colored sets in general. But maybe it'll look better ingame and on my troll girls.<br />
<br />
And finally, something that shows a little skin. I dunno, necklines like this are so much more attractive than ones that choke up the neck like... almost all previous tiers. Even being a chick, I don't mind my toons showing a bit of skin. (Except perhaps my plate wearers.)</div></div><hr />

To me the &quot;druidish&quot; look is in the Tier 1 through 6 sets.<br />

<br />
Also, the blue gems look a bit out of place, although I suspect green might be even worse due to a &quot;kryptonite look&quot;... perhaps instead of gems something a bit more elaborate and druidish could be put there, like, some plants/efflorescence?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gradywhite</div><div class="date">2011-09-13, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe the theme of the Druid set is unannounced because it is based on something from 4.3 that they haven't revealed yet. It could be a boss or major character that comes into play during the Deathwing raid. Since we know virtually nothing about the raid other than that it includes Deathwing over multiple phases/encounters, this could have some possibility, don't ya think?<br />

Though the mushrooms I mistook for crystals at first, the actual bits of druidic knick-knackery on the robes are awesome. Perhaps they could have done another animal theme, but I do like the sort of . . .deep forest look this one has. The belt especially is well done, it blends into the robe nicely. The longer I stare at it, the more I notice. I really dig how the sleeves are bound on to the arm, and though I can't see it totally clearly, there's something about the gloves/bracers that makes me happy. No, this is definitely not a set to love if you want something flashy or I AM DRUID!!! . . .but to me, it feels like a stately forest set. If anything should feel like forest, it's druid tier. . . .only complaint is that the mushrooms are too uniformly blue, but it's not a deal breaker for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just about my opinion, it's a pretty damn cool set, not overdone or anything, but still pretty cool.<br />
<br />
They seem to have captured the balance druid side pretty well here.<br />
<br />
This may be a contender against my malorne set that I am putting together... (Yeah I like the pants, haters gonna hate.)</div></div><hr />

Um...that's not shaman tier.<br />
<br />
<br />
But honestly, this is the most uncreative druid design I have ever seen. It's boring.</div></div><hr />

I am big on facial representation. Thus far we have warriors who get to look like deathwing. Ultimate!! Then you have locks who get to have a cool faceless swirling tenticle thingy.. and then druids... here ya go, heres a hood. and a plain set. If the set colour scheme didn't match I would accuse it of being questing greens in its simplicity. I'm not a hater, but I don't like it too much.. I hope the creativity didn't fizzle out on locks and warriors. Whats next mage? Cross your fingers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True dat, the odd-numbered Paladin sets are almost always lame. All you have to do is look at the big transmo thread in the Pally forums. Might be able to make one good set out of Lawbringer/T7.5 and the T5 recolor pieces...</div></div><hr />

The Colour system is okay i guess i quite like it. Glad this one is a robe, and quite a nice one. I would have to say that again this is not a druid tier to get excited about.</div></div><hr />

Enough with the WWE Belts already. They may look great on warriors and Dk's, but never druids. It also looks like the gear was put together with rope on the shoulders and sewn together horribly to look similar to the Leaper in WOTLK. Why do they want druids to look like the Leaper? Shouldn't druids be more druid like? There are so many themes that could be used, such as; Cat theme, bear, more tree bark stuff and bird feathers, native american theme, mushrooms, leaves and other plants. The colors are fine together except for the random yellow and gold in it. I just haven't really cared for any of the druid tiers after sets 1,2 and 4-8.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Porimlys</div><div class="date">2011-09-13, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like the earthy tones of this set. The whole set (obviously earth and deepholm influenced) gives me a lot of the same feelings I get when I'm in Deepholm. It's a very meditative zone; the simplicity of the set calls to that idea, the idea that the earth and rocks are very patient and steadfast. I can imagine someone wearing this garb sitting and contemplating for days in the fungal areas of deepholm, and over time the fungus grows on it. The vibrant simplicity gives it this traditional druid feel, as oppose to something like the Stormrider Regalia (my favorite set), which is a set that is more about &quot;Look how powerful I am with my crazy lightning and awesome wings and super electric colors&quot;. That's not a bad thing, but this is set is modest while still being impressive. I think that's what a druid set should be, and I think that's what a lot of the really good druid sets have achieved in the past. And that's why I like this set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree.<br />
<br />
I would also like to point out that this teir can be used by any other class, its not screaming druid, its yelling generic!<br />
<br />
<br />
I am sure the shaman tier will be much much worse. The tier 2 moose set has more character and druidness then this and I LOL at that set the 1st time I seen it.</div></div><hr />
