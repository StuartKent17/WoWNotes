<br />
No, it sounds like they're planning on making all of the RAF mounts available on an in-game vendor that requires a special 'token' that you get for doing RAF - so you can get 1 of any of the mounts per RAF.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you will no longer be able to obtain the Obsidian Nightwing if the Emerald Hippogryph is the new RaF mount (which is looks like it will be)<br />
<br />
&quot;Friends In Places Even Higher Than That (New) Obtain an Emerald Hippogryph mount through the Recruit-a-Friend program. Account Wide.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Read it again! You get to choose now which RAF mount you want, presumably going back to the zebra. Which really just means &quot;we are desperate enough to get you to invite 5 friends that you get a mount for each friend now instead of just the one since they're account-wide now&quot;. <br />

They already said they are making an in-game token vendor with all the old mounts plus the new one. Obsidian Nightwing won't be no longer obtainable once the new RAF system comes out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Friends In Places Even Higher Than That (New) Obtain an Emerald Hippogryph mount through the Recruit-a-Friend program. Account Wide.&quot;<br />
<br />
They're changing the RaF system so instead of going to the website to claim the current mount you're given a token ingame that you can exchange for any of the past RaF mounts or a pet at a vendor.</div></div><hr />

He should be on the PTR already. There's the Grevious Flaskataur who gives out the PVP gear right in the shrine and I think the Raid one is over in Townlong Steppes, I know he's somewhere because on the PTR I gave my premade T16 gear.</div></div><hr />

Ghost Gryphon is SoR not RaF. It's RaF getting the update in 5.4.1, not SoR. SoR just had a somewhat recent update, they won't be touching it for a little while now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Learn your fucking terminology. It's not a reskin - reskin just means that the texture has been changed. Ie. a standard blue drake could be said to be a reskin of a standard red drake etc etc.<br />
<br />
This is a new model. If anything in the shape of the model changes, then it's a new model. And this is quite different in shape in various areas to the regular hippogryphs. <br />
<br />
I can't stand it when people just scream &quot;reskin&quot; without having a bloody clue what they're talking about.</div></div><hr />

WTF? Wow. I MADE that man. Did you even bother to read the content in my post, rather than just looking at the pic and going and complaining about it? Seriously. I blatantly said it was a bug with the mmo-champion model viewer that allowed me to do it, and I took a few screenshots for everyone else to see it too.
