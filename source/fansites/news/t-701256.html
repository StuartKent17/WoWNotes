In the latest issue of PC Gamer (UK) (http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=238697) (buy online (http://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/store/displayitem.asp?sid=462&amp;id=8981&amp;ts=webgrshop)) is a 6 page article named '50 reasons to play Catalysm'. The vast majority of what is covered is already known/confirmed, however, there appears to be verifcation of certain rumours first made here on MMO-champion in the days before Blizzcon but that were never confirmed nor denied.<br />
<br />
Just a note on the source before everyone starts screaming for links for scans. I don't have any, nor would I post them if I had them. The proof however can be found in the highstreet shops of the UK in issue 212 of PC Gamer UK (April edition).<br />
<br />
Note #1 Important - The guys from PC Gamer were kind enough to give me a few more information on that. The article is NOT officially endorsed by Blizzard and is mostly the result of their own work, that means that a small part of speculation is involved. Just keep in mind that we're talking about people who interviewed developers in the past and who sell thousands of magazines each month. <br />
<br />
Note #2 - If you missed it (... really?) you can still read the original World of Warcraft Cataclysm (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm/) post. And you might want to check the Cairne Bloodhoof Quest Changes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/forge-of-souls-cairne-bloodhoof-blue-posts/) from the 3.3 PTRs. <br />
<br />
Note #3 - Yep, I totally stole the introduction of the post from Donbar's original post on the forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/general-discussions/cataclsym-rumours-confirmed-new-info-*spoilers*/). And I'll probably steal the rest below.<br />
<br />
Warchief of the Horde <br />
Thrall will become the next Guardian of Tirisfal. However, Thrall will merely 'leave Garrosh in charge' though this does not stop Garrosh from declaring war on the Alliance and fortifying Horde outposts and cities.<br />
<br />
Inner-Horde relations <br />
After assuming command of the Horde, Garrosh labels Cairne a traitor and executes the Tauren Leader. However, this does not seem to be the end of his involvement in Cataclysm and his seeming demise is linked to the greener, lusher Desolace.<br />
Garrosh will throw out most of the Blood Elves and Forsaken from Orgrimmar.<br />
<br />
Deepholme<br />
It is possible that the Alliance and Horde will be involved in a major battle within Deepholm. <br />
Airships will battle in the gigantic caverns al a Icecrown style. <br />
The area will also cater for flying mounts.<br />
<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
Cataclysm will ship with 8 Heroic Dungeons (not including Deadmines and Shadowfang) and 4 Raid encounters.<br />
The Skywall will contain a raid with Al'Akir as the end boss.<br />
Grim Batol and Uldum raid will patched in post-launch.<br />
<br />
Other<br />
Harrison Jones has returned with his friends and is linked to the Archaeology profession.<br />
One of the new features included in the guild interface/mechanics system is a Looking For Guild function.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frozen Orbs Greed/Need rolls in 3.3<br />
Yeah it just takes one person to press Need after everyone's pressed Greed on the Frozen Orbs and you miss out. But the good news is that in patch 3.3.3 this won't be the case anymore -- the roll for Frozen Orbs will be an automatic Greed roll. Rejoice! <br />

Low level talents in Cataclysm<br />
Yes, low level talents will be looked at extensively. The talent tier just above the 51-point talent was just a good example. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/29/23710210871-mastery-system-preview.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking stats and Stamina<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I buy that logic. If tanking gear had thousands and thousands of Stam, tanks would still socket Stamina because it's reliable. If your health is low, then even if your avoidance is 99% that means sometimes you're just going to die and no healer can save you. Now, if healers can generally heal you through damage but then eventually gas out, then avoidance becomes more attractive because it lets healers heal you longer. Does that mean you gem it? Not sure, but at least a trinket with all avoidance might be pretty exciting.<br />
<br />
We also think we figured out a budgeting scheme to let tank gear have the same basic Stamina as dps gear. It's not a huge balance concern either way, but it does look weird when dps plate has more.<br />
<br />
As for parry vs. dodge, there are just going to be a lot of debates both within our office and on all of the boards about how it should ideally work and the relative value of each. Those conversations are going to go on a long time and not the kind of thing that can easily be summed up in a pithy GC post. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23710460920-mastery-for-tanks.html))<br />
<br />
1v1 Balance and Healer vs. DPS<br />
To reiterate:<br />
<br />
1) I said at some point &quot;All things being equal, a dps should be able to kill a healer.&quot;<br />
<br />
2) OP wondered what the context was for that statement.<br />
<br />
3) I said the context was probably (because I don't remember) mana: meaning that all things being equal, a healer should eventually run out of mana. In other words, the way to counter a healer is to run them out of mana. It can't just be &quot;I explode the healer with my awesome damage&quot; because if that was true, it would mean a healer couldn't heal themselves through one attacker and would have little chance keeping themselves or a team member alive vs. 2 attackers.<br />
<br />
4) The real take home message is that we don't put a lot of time balancing 1 v 1. The reasons are A) that there is nothing in the game that showcases 1v 1 encounters (you don't get Arena points from duels), and B) 1 v 1 balance doesn't scale well to team balance, which is showcased in Arena and BGs.<br />
<br />
Players like to argue &quot;If it's balanced 1 v 1 then it will be balanced for any number of participants.&quot; But that math doesn't actually work because of team synergy. The definition of synergy is that the total effect is greater than the sum of the component parts, or in other words, 1 + 1 &gt; 2. The second you buff someone you are making both of you more powerful -- the buff is not divided by the number of recipients. Your team is more powerful than just the sum of what each of you can do individually. A 3 v 3 Arena match is fundamentally *not* a trio of 1 v 1 duels happening simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Another way to consider it is to look at the damage done by a 10 player raid. Is a 25 player raid roughly 2.5 times that of the 10 player? No, it's probably closer to 3.5 times. It's not a linear scale. Now to be fair some of that is from fewer healers and tanks, but even that helps to support my point that you can't extrapolate upwards from 1 player and expect to have a meaningful encounter.<br />
<br />
[...] If healers were overpowered relative to dps then you would see more two healer teams. Most of the time, that's just not worth the sacrifice you make in giving up that second dps player. I wish we saw more 2 healer teams in 5s, but that's a slight tangent.<br />
<br />
I do think mana for healers is too easy to come by and I've said that several times. Even if healers ran dry more often though, I don't think that should let a dps guy just beat a healer in every duel because &quot;Hey, I'm dps -- I should win.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23710551636-question-about-1v1-balance.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, just means they were idiots and mistook the announced four raid instances for single encounters.<br />
<br />
Besides, since this in no way officially endorsed by Blizzard, we can also follow that they don't know anything we don't, so this actually confirms that they were just rehashing old rumours.<br />
<br />
It does therefore neither confirm Cairnes death nor Thrall becoming the new Guardian.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Blizz said that Grim Batol will be one of the four initial raids, so they fucked up on that front as well.</div></div><hr />

God, Blizzard needs to hire some decent writers. This whole thing reeks of &quot;we need an easier excuse for PvP, so we're going to throw together a bunch of nonsense that ends up there. If it doesn't make any sense at all, oh well.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
(The one positive is that Med'an is dead, and with Thrall as the guardian, probably staying that way. That plotline was even worse then this Garrosh garbage, and needs to stay buried in the comics where few people will ever know about it.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thuran</div><div class="date">2010-03-12, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two small additions:<br />
<br />
1) Every piece of story that the expansion tells, it tells it through the eyes of the player, meaning our characters will KNOW it happens.<br />
<br />
This means that our character will be fully aware of Cairne's demise, which can mean two things: either that we try to stop garrosh from doing it, which could lead to the horde storyline of cataclysm being about our characters fighting garrosh from within.<br />
<br />
Or it could mean that our characters are fooled into helping Garrosh kill cairne.<br />
<br />
2) Saurfang survived Icecrown citadel!<br />
<br />
This cannot be understated, last time this discussion came up the talk was all about how the explanation for Saurfang letting it happen being that he might die in icecrown. Now that we know that didnt happen, the aspect of it changes radically, and the possibility of him being a key player in cataclysm rose to almost certainty. As our character already in wotlk accepted outright to help him fight garrosh when the time came, this means that Blizzard already decided our character sides with Saurfang, so again the horde storyline of us helping saurfang against garrosh, eventually leading to the death of garrosh and possibly saurfang taking over the horde, pops up as a realistic option.<br />
<br />
Since day 1, blizzard have said our character sides with Thrall and the new horde, that we loyal to them beyond any doubt. Everything that happens so far to the horde in cataclysm goes against everything our characters stand for, would seem odd for them to do a 180 out of the blue like that. <br />
<br />
What is worrying however is blizzard stated that &quot;garrosh is not a villain&quot;, which obviously doesnt make sense as he has not done a single nonevil nonagainstthehorde act so far, but anyway.<br />
This means that there is chance the quest lines might have us support garrosh &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would Blizzard want to make Garrosh the new horde leader in a way in which the whole Horde (and all horde players) will hate him?<br />
<br />
Conclusion: he won't last long.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobiasX</div><div class="date">2010-03-12, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now we only know 3 things about the situation in Cata (and even those could change):<br />
* Cairne will be killed, by somebody, for some reason<br />
* Thrall will stop actively leading the horde, for a while, for some reason<br />
* Garrosh will start actively leading the horde, for a while, for some reason<br />
<br />
Personally I'm going to wait until it happens in-game before complaining about it. I really hope we get to kill Garrosh eventually though, even if it just turns out he's been manipulated by Deathwing since he landed in Azeroth.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shrouded</div><div class="date">2010-03-12, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it's pretty probable that Garrosh will only be the leader for a short while - say, for the length of Cataclysm.

Oh, and as for his succesor, it's going to be his son most likely I remember a rumor about that one.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surmis</div><div class="date">2010-03-12, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ohkay I'm gonna call these spoilers shenaningas. I've been reading MMO champ for years but this actually made my blood boil so much I had to register and write here to let steam off<br />
<br />
One with deeply involved in the lore such as myself should be able to think these spoilers don't make much sense, or then Chris has totally fucked up the lore in WoW and only thing he cares about is how can they make more money out of wow, which is really sad.<br />
<br />
First off when Cairne was a major helper for Thrall and the orcs in Kalimdor, Orgrimmar might not be Orgrimmar today if not with the help of Cairne. The tauren chieftain also helds orcs in pretty high regard and are very close allies with 'em. I can't think at the moment why Garrosh would kill the leader of his biggest ally when he is going to declare a war against the Alliance, this seems very stupid and even though Garrosh is reckless and hot headed I don't think he is this stupid.<br />
<br />
Second, Cairne is considered as one of the most powerful mortals in the wow lore. I simply can't fathom the idea that someone like young orc Garrosh would be able to get Cairne, no this tauren is would hand Garrosh ass back to him pretty much instantly. Also I'm pretty sure other taurens wont just stand there and watch when their leader is being labeled as traitor and is demanded as executed. <br />
<br />
Third, how in the hell is Thrall going to be Guardian of Tirisfal, he is not mage and that spot is already reserved for Med'an. Are we gonna see fuck up in the lore again act as if Med'an never was?<br />
<br />
Last but certainly not least. Do you guys remember Garrosh's and Saurfang's dialogue in Warsong Hold. Saurfang told Garrosh that should he ever go into the &quot;dark path&quot; which can mean few things, war against alliance is one for sure, he would kill Garrosh before that day comes. I don't even want to think what kind of fate Saurfang has in Cataclysm if all these spoilers are true.<br />
<br />
Lore is a big thing for me since few games really have this deep and rich lore. Seeing it being changed to cater gameplay and how to get more money out of the game is honestly, very very sad thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if they used MMO-Champion/SomethingAwful as a source and are just spreading the rumour.<br />
<br />
Think of this, for example: Blizzard has just spent the least several month making Med'an--the only son of Medivh--the Guardian of Tirisfal. Now, he wasn't Guardian yet when the rumours came out, so it was semi-plausible (if unlikely) for Thrall to become Guardian. Now, however, in order for Thrall to become Guardian, something is going to have to happen to Med'an, which wouldn't make sense considering that Blizzard has spent so much time and money (artists and writers aren't free, nor is the contract with DC/Wildstorm) intorducing, building, and advancing his character, going to far as to officially make him the Guardian. For them to just kill him off doesn't make sense when they could have merely left him out or not made him the guardian in the first place.</div></div><hr />

After assuming command of the Horde, Garrosh labels Cairne a traitor and executes the Tauren Leader. However, this does not seem to be the end of his involvement in Cataclysm and his seeming demise is linked to the greener, lusher Desolace.<br />
Garrosh will throw out most of the Blood Elves and Forsaken from Orgrimmar.<br />

I can just imagine the scene. Garrosh walks in with 10-20 traitorous non-tauren horde while the whole Tauren race watches. He walks up to Cairne and executes him. Cairne Reincarnates. Thunder Bluff Bloodlusts.</div></div><hr />

Ugh the amount of dumb that follows posts like these makes me /facepalm and /sigh.<br />
<br />
Speculation is nice and all, but really it doesn't matter who claims to have confirmed rumors. Until the day it goes live or is confirmed by Blizzard all rumors are still rumors.<br />
(And i mean Blizzard says it personally, not some other guy's interpretation of what Blizzard said)<br />
<br />
Chris Metzen and whoever else is in charge of the direction WoW goes in up top of Blizzard these days can do ANYTHING they like with the lore. Even if it doesn't make sense AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME, it doesn't mean they cant throw stuff in between now and when it happens to make it make sense.<br />
<br />
Even if these rumors aren't true, even if they are completely made up, you and I have no way to know without inside information.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why not speculate about what sort of turn of events would have to happen for any of these to make sense? Then you can see just how far fetched it all is or is not.<br />
<br />
<br />
About the picture with Thrall and Cairne saving horde kids:<br />
Was it stated at any point when they were talking about it at blizzcon that it was an actual piece of lore or anything like that? Or did they say &quot;Hey look at what one of the artists here at Blizzard did, pretty cool huh?&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think the main thing people are overlooking is the difference between possible and probable.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that Garrosh brandishes Cairne a traitor and kills him?<br />
Yes - Blizzard has control, they can do whatever they like.<br />
<br />
It is probable that Garrosh brandishes Cairne a traitor and kills him?<br />
Yes and No, depending on what you are willing to put in between now and it happening.<br />
<br />
Lets pretend for a moment that all of this stuff does happen.<br />
1- Alrighty, the Cataclysm happens, Thrall gets caught in it and ends up recruiting the Goblins. Soon after that decides he has to go out and save the world, and he leaves Garrosh in charge.<br />
2- Garrosh decides he wants to go to war with the Alliance, and as the current commander-in-chief of the Horde he does.<br />
3- Cairne, being the loving guy that he is, says he wants no part in it, and decides to go after Thrall and help him instead, leaving Baine in charge.<br />
*Caine and Thrall save horde babies*<br />
4- Garrosh finds out about Cairne's choice, and as he personally chose to go against Garrosh's wishes, he is deemed a traitor. (Garrosh dealing in absolutes here)<br />
5- Political bullshit ensues.<br />
6- Garrosh goes after Cairne, Cairne and Thrall get separated and Garrosh takes out Cairne. Upon returning Garrosh says the Bloodhoof cant be trusted and enforce that the Grimtotem take over power in Thunderbluff.(Magatha supports Garrosh's demands for war, and is in his good books because of it) - manipulation 101<br />
7- Magatha has all the real power in Thunderbluff, and there is a big political conspiracy about why Baine remains the official leader of TB but is in control of none of it. Magatha and the Grimtotems take over power.<br />
<br />
Is any of it possible? Yes. Probable? Not as much.<br />
<br />
8- Thrall realises he cant repair the Cataclysm on his own, and joins up with the New Council of Tirisfal.<br />
9- Med'an realises he doesn't have the shamanistic power to fix the Cataclysm, and gives the mantle over to Thrall.<br />
<br />
Possible? Yes. Probable? No.<br />
<br />
Yes Med'an is the current guardian, but is it not possible for him to be succeeded? Is it not possible that Thrall can reconsider his choice to opt-out of the new council?<br />
Aegwynn &gt; Medivh &gt; Med'an &gt; Thrall?<br />
<br />
Again, Possible? Yes. Probable? No. Its already been explained why its not probable..<br />
<br />
<br />
Does it mean any of it is true? No. Does it mean it COULD be true? Yes. COULD it also be false? Yes.<br />
Nothing is confirmed unless Blizzard confirms it themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sarcasm? <br />
The reason the Blood Elves left the Alliance was because of the Alliance commander Garithos, who treated them very badly. The Naga came and offered the Belfs help, help which without they would have been destroyed and lost what they still had. Garithos labelled them traitors because of this, for taking help in their most dire moment of need when he had taken most of the forces for himself.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's Bolvar Mark 2, he gets killed, and then later on you get to Deathwing's lair and he's like torturing Cairne's spirit, then when you get to Deathwing himself and kill him, Alexstrasza is all like 'there must always be a black aspect' and then Cairne becomes it, then seals himself away. This should totally happen.</div></div><hr />

That wasn't it at all. Garithos was a bigoted bastard, yes, but he didn't speak for the Alliance as a whole. His decision to imprison Kael'thas and his entourage and have them executed was unforgivable, but on the flip side, Kael'thas did associate with the evil naga, and he was mainly concerned with feeding his people's magic addiction. The irony of it all is that Garithos was right about Kael'thas - but wrong about the elven race as a whole.<br />
<br />
The elves who remain in the Alliance are the ones who realize the allied nations don't share Garithos' view, and the ones who are trying to fight their magic addiction rather than give into it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
* Thrall will become the next Guardian of Tirisfal. However, Thrall will merely 'leave Garrosh in charge' though this does not stop Garrosh from declaring war on the Alliance and fortifying Horde outposts and cities.<br />
<br />
That better STILL be just a rumor because it STILL does not make ANY FUCKING SENSE!<br />
<br />
The comic <br />
a) made a very strong point about Med'an and ONLY Med'an being a viable Guardian of Tirisfal because of his status as a PalSchamMagZomgadin. Even, given the end of the Nexus war, the Guardian role would go back to a Arcane caster, not a shaman like Thrall<br />
b) the comic so far is OVER. It's now split in an Alliance and Horde comic that follow new storylines, the whole Guardian business is done. Med'an is the Guardian, they defeated Mutato-Cho'Gall etc. it's over...<br />
<br />
We already have a Guaridan of Tirisfal and even if, for some reason, we needed a new one, Thrall does not make any sense in this role.<br />
<br />
I COULD see Thrall taking over a new role giving his status as the world's most prominent Shaman and the Elemental-theme of Cataclysm, it makes sense for him to play some major role in this situation. But NOT as a &quot;Guardian of Tirisfal&quot;. Even if they adapted to this new situation - the Guardian is being empowered by a couple others, strong inviduals of this &quot;class&quot; ie. the &quot;original&quot; Guardians were of an Arcane nature and were being empowered by Arcane casters, mages, of Dalaran.<br />
A shaman CANNOT be empowered in this way because they don't actually possess power in the same sense of an arcane caster, the only power they have is GIVEN to them by the Elements. You can't &quot;empower&quot; a shaman with a stronger ability to &quot;compell&quot; the Elements. <br />
<br />
If they have to change all this stuff, why still call it Guardian of Tirisfal? <br />
<br />
It does not make any sense.<br />
<br />
I can buy all this &quot;Thrall leaves the Horde to help in the fight against Deathwing and to help calm down the Elements again&quot; etc., although it does not make sense that he would give leadership of the Horde to Garrosh. Thrall is not stupid, he HAS to know that Garrass will immediately start a war with the Alliance. He could have given leadership to Cairne, to Saurfang, hell, to Gamon! He's been with the Horde longer than Garrosh! He wanted to defend us against the evil death knights! ;)<br />
<br />
Have Thrall become the &quot;Elemental Guardian&quot; or whatever, but not &quot;Guardian of Tirisfal&quot;! This role is a) occupied and b) does not make any sense.</div></div><hr />

Garithos, as a racist, took one look at the Naga and automatically assumed they were trouble... and out of fear assumed that Kael'thas would turn on the Alliance with the help of Lady Vashj.<br />

Garithos pushed Kael'thas, and the Elves along with him, out of the Alliance.<br />

<br />
Yes, I said he was a racist, but you're mistaken about some other points.<br />
<br />
Whether Garithos knew that the naga were evil at that point is up in the air; he could certainly have encountered them &quot;off-camera&quot; before, but it's not really important - he didn't fear them, they weren't even his primary concern at all. He wanted to get rid of the elves. Period. He sent them on a suicide mission against the Scourge, and when that didn't work out, he used their involvement with the naga as an excuse to have them executed. So yes, he was a bigoted bastard. No one disagrees with that.<br />
<br />
The assumption is that he spoke for the Alliance, which he didn't. The Alliance was shattered and broken at that point and Garithos only really spoke for the men under his current command - which unfortunately led to the schism with the elves. However, that Kael'thas just wanted to prove himself is a laughable assumption. It doesn't take any convincing at all from Vashj to lead him down the path of demonic magic. His true motivations were always to find a new source of magic for himself and his people, and it didn't really matter what that source of magic was.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the bottom line is that the entire divide between the elven nation and the Alliance could've been avoided if anyone but Garithos had been in charge at Dalaran, as he was the instigator - not the Alliance as a whole.</div></div><hr />

This is very story progressive movement being discussed here. And what do the alliance have to say about their story having an exciting conflict that they're going to be crossing their fingers for? Nothing, because they haven't mentioned anything about the alliance having any inner conflict of any sort. So first I'd like to say thanks to blizzard, because if this is the sort of twists that are happening within the game, I'm just glad the horde gets to receive attention and be a part of it.<br />
<br />
Secondly lets take a step back and remember another event that had us going &quot;whAAAAAA?1! NOOOO!&quot;. Remember in early wrath when the wrathgate cinematic was first discovered and we were all questioning the stability of the horde and weather or not the undead would remained allied with us (and how on earth blizzard found the coolest voice actor in the world for Putress?). Remember when we were IMMEDIATELY called upon because a HUGE battle had begun in undercity? I don't know about you guys but I absolutely loved that questline where we fought along side of Thrall and Slyvanas! Very exciting and very fun. Now, just imagine what they could do with this huge betrayal conspiracy plot that's being whipped up! What if there was a quest where shortly after Cairne is killed, Saurfang decides to take matters into his own hands and rid the horde of the plight that is Garrosh? So he recruits only the best who can keep their mouths shut and do the right thing into a small infiltration group to make Garrosh disappear from the horde over night which of course includes YOU! Then you go sneaking about and just when you think you've caught Garrosh off guard it turns out he predicted such actions and thus has put you into a terrible trap within his quarters, of which you must now escape and complete the mission! Or even better maybe someone who is a key character within your squad has served as a double agent and exposed your plan to Garrosh, leading to such dire circumstances.<br />

<br />
Did any of you even for a moment before going off in a foaming stream of incoherent NO!-screams consider the fact that Boubouille has been in contact with the PC Gamer editors? And, after said little chatter, he still chose to post the leak on the front page of this most esteemed website. This likely means that;<br />
<br />
<br />
1) PC Gamer have confirmed that they have other sources than <br />
Boubouille's Cataclysm leak<br />
<br />
Why would they wait until this point in time with writing an article if the only source they had was Boubouille's leak from August last year anyway? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Boubouille has checked this leak with his, as time has proven numerous <br />
times, very reliable sources at Blizzard <br />
<br />
He is not exactly known for posting unfounded rumours on his website, as time has also proven numerous times.<br />
<br />
<br />
I conclude, the stuff in this leak will turn out to be true. Any donkey with half a brain could have reached the same conclusion through logic and half a minute of (gasp!) thinking.<br />
<br />
Also, stop the senseless kneejerk whining about Cairne. Yes, lore progresses, and yes, Blizzard actually have the balls to kill off major lore characters that aren't bad guys. However, how on earth do you reach the conclusion that his death will not make sense? Nobody knows the full context of the execution yet. As was pointed out a few points ago, people were raging about the supposed incoherence of the Wrathgate plot too, but I think most people agree that it worked out pretty well. <br />
<br />
Warcraft is a billion-dollar franchise. A literal goldmine. Blizzard aren't about to fuck it up. You think they already have? Then perhaps you should stop caring, because 11 million people are still paying their monthly subscriptions to play it. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but how's Garrosh going to execute him if he's out in the field with Thrall? Anyway, no matter what, I still think that pic is a stronger indication of him not being killed than anything I've seen/read stating the contrary :)</div></div><hr />

I don't really see why blizzard would remove the horde from the horde by having every faction basically have reasons to hate the others. Everyone already hates undead, but now Blood elves and Tauren will hate Orcs.<br />
<br />
Also I don't see how if Thrall is going to become the new guardian he was kidnapped by alliance soldiers and then those alliance get ship wrecked on the same island as goblins. Then those goblins defeat the alliance that freed thrall? The whole guardian theme doesn't tie into what is known of thralls story in cataclysm so far.<br />
<br />

Exactly. Why wait half a year, they could've copy/pasted those rumors back then when it was fresh news to everyone.

Boub said all these things ages just before Blizzcon. I think the only thing that may have been different was that Boub said Cairne would be assassinated or something, rather than executed by Garrosh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Boub didn't say them, he got them from another source then said he confirmed them. Don't confuse sources of information. This leak originated from somethingawful forums then that was &quot;dropped&quot; from the picture and minds of people when boub confirmed it himself and stopped referring to their source of the original leak.</div></div><hr />

It's FUN. If this all turns out to be true that's great, and if it doesn't and people get whiplashed into an entirely different situation when the truth comes out, so much the better. Don't you love it when things aren't as they seem, or when you didn't see something coming? Have fun with the supposition. It doesn't hurt anything/anyone.<br />
<br />
As for the Thrall/Garrosh/Cairne thing, I say bring it on. I'll HATE it ... and I'll love hating it ... and I think that's the point. If Thrall had no faults and Garrosh was completely loyal and levelheaded, and if Cairne wasn't murdered well, how much fun would there be in that? We could just go play Hello Kitty Island and be done with it. I agree with an earlier poster, this sounds more like World of WARcraft. Get righteously indignant! Don't defend Org when the allies attack! /spit on Garrosh when you see him if you want to, etc. The whole thing gets your blood pumping and that's a good thing. If Garrosh does take over and alienates the other horde races imagine the epic sh*t storm that could take place later when Garrosh is eventually strung up (he has to be at some point, right?). It's a good story. It may not be a nice touchy feeley warm and fuzzy story, but it's a good story.</div></div><hr />

It makes even less sense to put thrall back in charge of the orcs and horde after the expansion is over. He would be going from anti-alliance to guardian of all (including alliance) back to anti-alliance? If thrall becomes guardian then isn't guardian and leader of the horde again in next x-pac blizzard just isn't trying anymore.</div></div><hr />

The war Blizzard wants to put back into the game is between the horde and alliance. Inter-faction warfare serves little purpose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah ok.. Did you even do the Battle for the Undercity? She was kissing Thrall's butt the whole time, she didn't take charge at all.<br />
<br />
So when is Me'dan going to die? I don't read the comics but he's the current Guardian of Tirisfal. This is why Thrall becoming Guardian is rather... unbelievable right now. And comic lore does count, since that's where Varian came from (unless they chose to retcon Me'dan... ugh..).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did any of you even for a moment before going off in a foaming stream of incoherent NO!-screams consider the fact that Boubouille has been in contact with the PC Gamer editors? And, after said little chatter, he still chose to post the leak on the front page of this most esteemed website. This likely means that;<br />
<br />
<br />
1) PC Gamer have confirmed that they have other sources than <br />
Boubouille's Cataclysm leak<br />
<br />
Why would they wait until this point in time with writing an article if the only source they had was Boubouille's leak from August last year anyway? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Boubouille has checked this leak with his, as time has proven numerous <br />
times, very reliable sources at Blizzard <br />
<br />
He is not exactly known for posting unfounded rumours on his website, as time has also proven numerous times.<br />
<br />
<br />
I conclude, the stuff in this leak will turn out to be true. Any donkey with half a brain could have reached the same conclusion through logic and half a minute of (gasp!) thinking.<br />
<br />
Also, stop the senseless kneejerk whining about Cairne. Yes, lore progresses, and yes, Blizzard actually have the balls to kill off major lore characters that aren't bad guys. However, how on earth do you reach the conclusion that his death will not make sense? Nobody knows the full context of the execution yet. As was pointed out a few points ago, people were raging about the supposed incoherence of the Wrathgate plot too, but I think most people agree that it worked out pretty well. <br />
<br />
Warcraft is a billion-dollar franchise. A literal goldmine. Blizzard aren't about to fuck it up. You think they already have? Then perhaps you should stop caring, because 11 million people are still paying their monthly subscriptions to play it. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Read the blizzard comments about the rumors from AFTER boub posted them, they shot them down. The fact that half of the &quot;Info&quot; that PC gamer &quot;Magazine&quot; has published is OLD info that has been shot down. <br />

<br />
As for Cairne's &quot;demise&quot;, did everyone really just overlook the detail that mentions Desolace? <br />
<br />
<br />
After assuming command of the Horde, Garrosh labels Cairne a traitor and executes the Tauren Leader. However, this does not seem to be the end of his involvement in Cataclysm and his seeming demise is linked to the greener, lusher Desolace.<br />
<br />
To me, that looks like an assumption made more from the player's perspective than an actual fact. Let's not forget that although Blizz does kill off characters, they have a habit of resurrecting them as they see fit. It's also worth noting that his death's relation to Desolace could very well be symbolic of what's to really become of him. Desolace is going through a majour rebirth in Cataclysm. Perhaps it's not the only thing that's coming back to life...</div></div><hr />

I've read every single blue post since WotLK beta. They never shot the rumours down, Blizzard simply don't do that. They've neither confirmed nor denied anything so far except for hinting that something major would be up with Garrosh in Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;O Hai! I killed ur daddy, cause he disagreed with me. We canz still bez friendz?&quot; <br />
<br />
I'll believe this when I see it in game. If things actually do go like this the hack writing required will be astounding. Not to mention that IIRC Medan is the Guardian of Tirisfal. Are they gonna set up this huge story line around him, only to kill him off in a couple of months, just when it appears the prophesies about him are coming true? I call bullshit. We'll see of course, but it make *very* little sense. I say this as a firm Alliance player with very little at stake in the matter beyond a desire for a somewhat reasonable storyline.</div></div><hr />

Let's say this is all an April Fool's prank. I could almost believe that, if say, Boub posted this stuff on April 1st. The article might from the April issue, but last I checked, this was March 12th. A bit early to start tricking people in light of the holiday.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't Boub that posted in the first place, he simply posted on the front page a thread from the Cataclysm forum.<br />

The thing about Thrall being the new Guardian is what was the point of even putting Med'an in the comic if he is just going to be replaced soon after?

Meh. We'll have to agree to disagree on whether or not inter-faction warfare serves a purpose. I think it adds a lot of flavor. &quot;Us versus Them&quot; is fine, but when you toss in a dose of &quot;Brother against Brother&quot; it adds more depth.</div></div><hr />

Note #1 Important - The guys from PC Gamer were kind enough to give me a few more information on that. The article is NOT officially endorsed by Blizzard and is mostly the result of their own work, that means that a small part of speculation is involved.

<br />
It's not his fault that people don't ready disclaimers.<br />

Back in the day when the orcs first landed on Kalimdor they saved a Tauren from being killed by the centaur, who led them to Cairne. After this Cairne helped Thrall find the Oracle and build Orgimmar. When Baine was taken captive by the centaur Thrall sent some of his highest warriors to help the Tauren. And it has been stated that Cairne and Thrall view each other as brothers, Cairne went as far as to make Thrall his blood brother. So in keeping with lore and characters personalities I have no idea how Thrall would let this happen.</div></div><hr />

If Garrosh did kill Cairne. I'd bet it would be pretty much like Goku from DragonBall Z turning SSJ the first time.

<br />
The decision to reform the Council of Tirisfal was made by a group of three people at Theramore Isle after Med'an was rescued from Cho'Gall: Aegwynn, Jaina Proudmoore, and Meryl Winterstorm. They also planned to recruit Maraad, Khadgar, Broll Bearmantle, and Thrall; with Malygos's actions hampering arcane magic across the world, it was decided that they would need to include practitioners of divine and nature magic as well, such as the dwarven High Priest, Rohan; the gnome, Krank Axeljink; and the tauren Archdruid, Hamuul Runetotem.[1] Thrall and Khadgar declined, but appointed Reghar Earthfury and Dalynnia Wrathscar respectively to serve on the council in their stead. <br />

No offense to the single fan of Garrosh but I don't think anyone really believes Thrall was trying very hard by the time the scourge attacked.<br />
1. I'm pretty sure he didn't pop wolves.<br />
2. He's the best shaman in the game and he hadn't bothered to drop totems yet.<br />
3. No bloodlust.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The decision to reform the Council of Tirisfal was made by a group of three people at Theramore Isle after Med'an was rescued from Cho'Gall: Aegwynn, Jaina Proudmoore, and Meryl Winterstorm. They also planned to recruit Maraad, Khadgar, Broll Bearmantle, and Thrall; with Malygos's actions hampering arcane magic across the world, it was decided that they would need to include practitioners of divine and nature magic as well, such as the dwarven High Priest, Rohan; the gnome, Krank Axeljink; and the tauren Archdruid, Hamuul Runetotem.[1] Thrall and Khadgar declined, but appointed Reghar Earthfury and Dalynnia Wrathscar respectively to serve on the council in their stead. <br />
<br />
So....<br />
<br />
<br />
^this<br />
<br />
Why would they spend so much time getting Me'dan ready to be the new Gaurdian if he was only going to be killed and Thrall take the position instead? It doesn't make sense for them to do this</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the Bloodhoof assassination thing, you don't stay friend with someone who kills your beloved leader, of all the leaders of the horde/alliance, i'm very sure most people of either side like Cairne the most. As for Thrall being Tirisfal Guardian, the post has been filled thank you, Med'an is the Guardian, i don't see how Thrall can handle arcane, druidic, and holy magic, when he's more dedicated to being a Shaman.</div></div><hr />

The article is NOT officially endorsed by Blizzard and is mostly the result of their own work, that means that a small part of speculation is involved.<br />
<br />
So... could it be they ultimately got the speculative parts from your very article back then? This does not prove a thing, actually.<br />
&quot;PC Gamer says it's true because Boub said so, and Boub says it's true because PC Gamer confirms it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I still call bullshit on the &quot;Cairne gets killed&quot; rumor (we only know that Baine will succeed him, and from that the rumours started)<br />
The Tauren as a whole would never accept their leader, the one who reunited the tribes, getting marked as a traitor and executed, especially not under Garrosh, and especially his son would not play along and become a handpuppet of the guy who murdered his father.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This means Thrall leaves the playing field as horde warchief. If Thrall leaves, who is the 'lore-logical' second choice to lead the Horde (not just the orcs, but the whole Horde)? I'd say: Cairne.<br />
Cairne has been Thrall's buttbuddy since Warcraft 3 and seems to be in a more senior position for Warchief. However, Blizzard has confirmed that Garrosh will be Warchief and Baine takes over as Tauren leader. That means Cairne also leaves the playing field.<br />
<br />
Thrall leaves without dying, which means that he will be doing something more important than leading his people. One of the only logical explanations seems to be saving the world from the Cataclysm. Even though he is not a mage, he is a shaman, and the Cataclysm will be about elements etc. Why would a mage be the next world-saviour, while the problem lies with the elements?<br />
I'm not saying Thrall will be the next Guardian of Tirisfal, because I don't know if that'll be his title, but he will be the next world-saviour. <br />
<br />
What about Cairne? He'll join him, or die trying.</div></div><hr />

In our server Thrall actually killed Garrosh many times 'cause due to some bug Garrosh was just slapping Thrall and got his ass beaten.<br />
<br />
Also like many have posted, Thrall refused to join the circle already once and appointed someone else to take the place, the pic on last page SA goons lolling at PC gamer falling for their spoilers.</div></div><hr />

* Thrall will become the next Guardian of Tirisfal. However, Thrall will merely 'leave Garrosh in charge' though this does not stop Garrosh from declaring war on the Alliance and fortifying Horde outposts and cities.<br />
<br />
I thought Med'an was the new guardian. Hmmm... What will then happen to Med'an?<br />
<br />
Inner-Horde relations<br />
<br />
* After assuming command of the Horde, Garrosh labels Cairne a traitor and executes the Tauren Leader. However, this does not seem to be the end of his involvement in Cataclysm and his seeming demise is linked to the greener, lusher Desolace.<br />
* Garrosh will throw out most of the Blood Elves and Forsaken from Orgrimmar.<br />
<br />
It pisses me off that Garrosh will kill Cairne.<br />
But I cheer at Garrosh for throwing out the belfs and forsaken from orgrimmar! /cheer for that!<br />
<br />
But still a minus for killing Cairne, that just sucks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It is worth remembering, our noble and beloved Cairne is only the Chieftain because there is no one else to take up the role. He is training his son to take up his position and he acknowledges that he himself is getting too old and will likely step down as soon as the time is right.<br />
<br />
If Thrall is leaving the Horde for other business, it is highly likely that Cairne would accompany him out of his deep loyalty to Thrall and leave Baine in charge. <br />
<br />
Since we have no 100% confirmation that Cairne is dying, I am hoping this is what happens! Lets face it, if Garrosh kills Cairne, Garrosh will die before this expansion is over.</div></div><hr />

Again, it's not the question of the rumors, it's the question of all info together:<br />
<br />
- Fact: These rumors appeared on SA Goon Squad forums one/two days before Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
- Fact: These rumors were never confirmed or denied, but many lore developments happened since then that basically makes some of the rumors not possible.<br />
<br />
- Fact: Boub does post a disclaimer.<br />
<br />
- Fact: It's the PC Gamer April's issue.<br />

<br />
Well the most obvious consequence would be the Tauren splitting from the Horde, or at least toning down their relations with the Horde/Orgrimmar even below the level of the Forsaken and Blood Elves. The Horde would only continue to exist on paper.</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to say I knew what loop's intent was with his comment, but maybe the fact that Thrall wasn't trying very hard (I agree) was a problem in and of itself? I don't know. Just sayin'. Maybe it goes to the brother against brother argument. Torn loyalties and all that. If he couldn't open a can of whoop ass on Garrosh when the scourge was attacking, what will it take?</div></div><hr />

Like I said above, first post on this page, the mag's probably just putting together some of the rumors they heard over the course of the last half year.<br />

That's one of the disadvantages of the print medium and probably the fault of the writers' mentality as well, they try to sell you info that has been floating around on the 'net for &quot;ages&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember that to make Med'an a guardian the members of the council gave him their powers<br />
- power of a shaman<br />
- power of a mage<br />
- power of a paladin<br />
<br />
All this is speculation, but &quot;maybe&quot; after Med'an's demise Thrall is someway designed to be the new guardian because he's bound to the elements and cata is all about elements. And the council give him the power of a mage too<br />
<br />
That would explain why we would be able to play an orc mage in the Xpack :)<br />
<br />
But as I said before it's highly unlikely and i still believe that med'an will be the Guardian for quite a time. Same for Cairne, his assassination is highly unlikely. I still believe these are complete rumors ;)</div></div><hr />

that scenario will make the tauren leave the horde and declare themselves nuetral, I say Garrosh better have plenty of guards everyone, even when he takes a dump, because if Cairne is Dead, it's OPEN SEASON ON GARROSH, Saurfang for Warchief!!<br />

I love the Varian lore, He doesn't hate all the Orcs, and he doesn't hate the entire horde, or else why would have a Belf rogue as one of his bodyguards. Varian Hates Garrosh very much, they even crossed swords in Dalaran during the Dialogue of 3.1, and in Fall of the Lich King, he made sure no one would attack Saurfang the Elder after the Alliance Defeated Deathbringer Saurfang. It is a preview of who Varian would rather deal with, once Thrall is no longer warchief.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it just takes one person to press Need after everyone's pressed Greed on the Frozen Orbs and you miss out. But the good news is that in patch 3.3.3 this won't be the case anymore -- the roll for Frozen Orbs will be an automatic Greed roll. Rejoice! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I LOL at retards that wait till the last second to roll need on these. How pathetic is your account that you don't already have like 200 of these sitting in a bank somewhere. They still only sell for like 4 gold. Just a big dick move. You don't NEED a frozen orb. You may want it, you may have use for it when they will be able to be traded for other things, but NEED is just LOL.</div></div><hr />

The only cool thing is he comes back all jedi style in desolace...maybe. But seriously i hope the tauren respond to this and leave orgrimmar for the orcs and trolls...they can try defending it without us...<br />
<br />
<br />
Cairne probably secretly works close to nightelves in regards to fixing desolace after garrosh delcare war on the alliance, therefore considers him a traitor, thats the only sense i can make of him killing Cairne off. He probably doent boot the taurens out of orgrimmar, just blood elves and undead because they were previously alliance and he sees no true reason for them to be in the center of orgrimmar.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, but there's more: the foreigners orcs ravaged his kingdom and killed all his family and friends when he was only a child, later, when he was older, saw how the orcs, trolls, ogres and goblins almost destroy completely what was left of humanity, and more recently when he was kidnapped and treated like a slave or when the Horde &quot;killed&quot; his best friend … to name just a few examples...</div></div><hr />

Me'dan ill be the new guardian. You can allready read alot of the Cataclysm lore on wowwiki.com. Thrall will be his trainer in the arts of shamanism.<br />
<br />
I actually think that most of the things told in this magazine aren't true. <br />
<br />
<br />
I agree. I mean Med'an is proficent in Shamanism, Arcane Magic and Paladinism (is that even a word? Well you got the idea.) They made talks about him being a member of the council, not the next guardian. Either way it would piss a lot of folks off on the horde side since Thrall was our excuse to go in and be ass hats.<br />
<br />
&quot;The horde is full of barbaric murderers!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Thrall?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.. yeah is cool.&quot;<br />

<br />

Wrong. You have not read the book Blood and Honor(which predates WoW and quest lines about the book is in game). He was exiled as a decanonized paladin because he gave sanctuary to Etrigg an old orc veteran. He has long left the Alliance because he knew they were too blinded to see orcs or the horde as honorable.</div></div><hr />

Read the comics. Med'an is the guardian. Thrall would never willingly give leadership to Garrosh. He knows Garrosh is too reckless and war hungry, just like his father. It would be like letting your kids take care of your guns while you are on vacation. Garrosh becomes the warchief because Thrall was captured by the alliance. By the time he was set free it was already too late.<br />
<br />
I don't believe Cairne being murdered either. The tauren would immediately leave the horde if Garrosh had their chieftain killed.</div></div><hr />

The tauren chieftain also helds orcs in pretty high regard and are very close allies with 'em. I can't think at the moment why Garrosh would kill the leader of his biggest ally when he is going to declare a war against the Alliance, this seems very stupid and even though Garrosh is reckless and hot headed I don't think he is this stupid.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrosh is a freakin moron. his entire MO in any story plot so far has been &quot;zomg i hate you varynn! lets fight! waaagh!!!&quot; Garrosh strikes me as a Sith-like individual. If you don't back him up 110%, then your obviously against him and need to be dealt with. If he can down Cairne, then I doubt many other tauren are gonna go &quot;hey, fighting that guy seems like a great idea&quot; Lets also not forget that even though we may only see 100ish NPCs in a town/city, by story standards, there are thousands. So if only a handfull witness what happens, its an easy cover up. Baine may very well be backing Garrosh. Baine is young just like Garrosh, and will most likely not be prone to wise and rational thought like thrall would be. Now don't get me wrong, as an alley player, the only thing I like about Varynn is his armor looks cool, and his swords are big. nine times out of ten he's just as dumb and quick to try and fight as well. What with all the little cut scenes and story dialogue exchanged recently, its easy to see that Garrosh and Varynn hate each other to the core. Cairne, is gonna be all &quot;yo wtf dude&quot; and garrosh is gonna be all &quot;stfu noob i got this, move naow!&quot; fighting ensues, Garrosh goes all aniken skywalker on him, shit happens, Cairnes dead, everyones wondering wtf to do... *takes deep breath* <br />
<br />
Also, forgive the godwin's here, but Garrosh is a lot like hitler. Everyone praised him at first, and then wham, oh shit, i got the power..ABUSE TIME!<br />
<br />
Also, you stated that Cairne would own Garrosh in a 1v1. While this on paper looks to be true, any storyline based battle can go either way. <br />

Basically, if his dead is correct, Blizzard made a character for Warcraft3, they put it in WoW for nothing, doesn't change his stuff in 6 years because &quot;he will be dead&quot;, so why changing nothing? That would mean a faggotry uppon Blizzard never reached before.</div></div><hr />

The Naga came and offered the Belfs help, help which without they would have been destroyed and lost what they still had. Garithos labelled them traitors because of this, for taking help in their most dire moment of need when he had taken most of the forces for himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Nagas did not only offer that timely assistance to the blood elves, in fact, the blood elves, at first, refused to interact with these creatures, yet, when the Nagas offered them the vile magic of their master Illidan, the blood elves accepted gladly this alliance, knowing that this would be considered high treason that is punishable by death.<br />
Is not this a strange coincidence that the Nagas come to the aid of the Blood Elves at the right time? Actually it is not surprising since all this issue was being orchestrated from the highest levels, including how Garithos acted (way to act that did not share the rest of the Alliance).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
someone didn't play WC3...the alliance turned their back on the elves in their time of need, used them as cannon fodder and left them for dead...really all the elves who still side with the alliance are the real traitors...<br />
<br />
<br />
The alliance DID NOT turn his back to the elves for the simple reason that all his members (including the gnomes who were being attacked in their city) were ravaged by war, and therefore, they could not help their elf friends. The elves who are still on the side of the alliance are the true loyal to their allies, after all, the blood elves are the ones who have allied with their enemies (the Horde), so they are the real traitors.<br />
<br />

That wasn't it at all. Garithos was a bigoted bastard, yes, but he didn't speak for the Alliance as a whole. His decision to imprison Kael'thas and his entourage and have them executed was unforgivable, but on the flip side, Kael'thas did associate with the evil naga, and he was mainly concerned with feeding his people's magic addiction. The irony of it all is that Garithos was right about Kael'thas - but wrong about the elven race as a whole.<br />
The elves who remain in the Alliance are the ones who realize the allied nations don't share Garithos' view, and the ones who are trying to fight their magic addiction rather than give into it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Accurate. You're absolutely right, you can not explain it better. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Garithos was a racist.<br />
He also hated Dwarves as much as he hated the Elves.<br />
He didnt care for Kael'thas... not because he was addicted to magic, but because he wasn't Human.<br />
And who was to say the Naga was evil at that point? They had not done anything for Garithos or Kael'thas to believe they was evil.<br />
Garithos, as a racist, took one look at the Naga and automatically assumed they were trouble... and out of fear assumed that Kael'thas would turn on the Alliance with the help of Lady Vashj.<br />
Garithos pushed Kael'thas, and the Elves along with him, out of the Alliance.<br />
All Kael'thas ever wanted was to prove himself... which led him down the dark path to the events of The Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Nagas had already made occasional appearances on the islands of Kul Tiras and were known as evil creatures that worship an old god and assaulted ships at sea, meaning that they were well known. But you are right when you say that Garithos pushed Kael'thas, and the Elves along with him, out of the Alliance, yet, who was benefited from the alliance will fall apart completely?<br />
<br />
Clearly Garithos was being controlled (directly or indirectly) to carry out this purpose, but by whom? It is also clear: by the dreadlords Detheroc and Balnazzar, ie by the Burning Legion who pretended to break up any resistance that could hinder their mission to destroy Azeroth. These dreadlords were also the responsible for inducing the alliance between the Naga and blood elves? I think it's pretty obvious, in fact, the Nagas have always had a great relationship with the Burning Legion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, I said he was a racist, but you're mistaken about some other points.<br />
Whether Garithos knew that the naga were evil at that point is up in the air; he could certainly have encountered them &quot;off-camera&quot; before, but it's not really important - he didn't fear them, they weren't even his primary concern at all. He wanted to get rid of the elves. Period. He sent them on a suicide mission against the Scourge, and when that didn't work out, he used their involvement with the naga as an excuse to have them executed. So yes, he was a bigoted bastard. No one disagrees with that.<br />
<br />
The assumption is that he spoke for the Alliance, which he didn't. The Alliance was shattered and broken at that point and Garithos only really spoke for the men under his current command - which unfortunately led to the schism with the elves. However, that Kael'thas just wanted to prove himself is a laughable assumption. It doesn't take any convincing at all from Vashj to lead him down the path of demonic magic. His true motivations were always to find a new source of magic for himself and his people, and it didn't really matter what that source of magic was.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the bottom line is that the entire divide between the elven nation and the Alliance could've been avoided if anyone but Garithos had been in charge at Dalaran, as he was the instigator - not the Alliance as a whole.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're absolutely right again, perfectly well explained.</div></div><hr />

Lets look at what we know:<br />
1) Thrall knows that Garrosh is incapable of being a good leader.<br />
2) Thrall also knows Garrosh is gaining a huge following amongst the blood thirsty orcs, and might gain enough support to overthrow him.<br />
<br />
Lets speculate.<br />
<br />
Why would Thrall leave Garrosh incharge? <br />
Maybe to prove to his supporters that he would bring ruin, thereby curbing any rebellion forming.<br />
<br />
So what happens down the line<br />
1) Garrosh declares all out war against the alliance, who are an equal match.<br />
2) He kills a popular leader of an allied race, and alienates two others. Specially since Undead were already only party in the horde(for eg: you start with lower horde rep as an undead) and Sylvanas pretty much stuck by only because she respects Thrall. Same with Blood elfs, they don't have any loyalty for the Horde, they're in it for convenience and security.<br />
3) Horde is considerably weaken due to splintering, internal conflict, low morale amongst all but the orcs and a horrible leader. UC and SM being closer to Alliance territories face a greater threat. People start seeing how incompetent Garrosh is.<br />
4) Either Thrall comes back. Or maybe Sylvanas heads up a &quot;new horde&quot; with Undead, and Belfs, Orcs and Tauren that disagree with Garrosh/Baine. And Trolls just jump in cause the new horde is more powerful. Don't really know, not much going on politically with the Trolls.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willjones410</div><div class="date">2010-03-12, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Nagas did not only offer that timely assistance to the blood elves, in fact, the blood elves, at first, refused to interact with these creatures, yet, when the Nagas offered them the vile magic of their master Illidan, the blood elves accepted gladly this alliance, knowing that this would be considered high treason that is punishable by death.<br />
Is not this a strange coincidence that the Nagas come to the aid of the Blood Elves at the right time? Actually it is not surprising since all this issue was being orchestrated from the highest levels, including how Garithos acted (way to act that did not share the rest of the Alliance).<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this your &quot;Theory&quot; again on how Garithos was being mind-controlled by the Dreadlords from the beginning? Do I need to re-post the WoW-wiki article showing how false that is? Garithos didn't come into contact with those dreadlords until AFTER Kael'thas and his bands escaped from his order for them to be executed. Before then, he was acting of his own accord as his normal, human-supremacist, spiteful self.<br />
<br />
I guess I do.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Garithos returned and saw the naga leaving the scene, and, infuriated, said this was the proof he was waiting for to execute Kael and the blood elves.[6] He arrested Kael and his servitors and locked them in the Dalaran dungeons to await their execution, under the guard of Kassan.[11] But soon Garithos heard that Kael had escaped with Vashj's help and were fleeing through a mystic portal. Garithos sent his men, armed with explosives, to destroy the portal, but the elven engineers Kael had freed used their knowledge to construct strategic defense systems. Kael and Vashj defended the portal and eventually fled themselves.[12]<br />
<br />
Garithos, though furious, turned his attention back to the advancing undead. He pushed them back into Plaguelands, but was soon faced with the dreadlords, Detheroc and Balnazzar. Detheroc's powers of mental domination made quick slaves of Garithos and his men. The human served as Detheroc and Balnazzar's pet for some time until they were attacked by Sylvanas and Varimathras. Sylvanas slew Detheroc and Garithos was freed from his bondage. Garithos was asked to join Sylvanas in the final attack on Balnazzar and he agreed, so long as Lordaeron was left to him. The banshee agreed - but secretly had no intention of keeping her word.[13] <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
WoWwiki and game lore both crit you for 19K. ;D<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The alliance DID NOT turn his back to the elves for the simple reason that all his members (including the gnomes who were being attacked in their city) were ravaged by war, and therefore, they could not help their elf friends. The elves who are still on the side of the alliance are the true loyal to their allies, after all, the blood elves are the ones who have allied with their enemies (the Horde), so they are the real traitors.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is one truth here. The nation of Quel'thelas stopped being members of the Alliance after the second war, much like Gilneas did. They at least kept open communications though so guys like Kael'thas could learn magics at Dalaran, but it still stands that QT was no longer part of the Alliance. As such, the Alliance nations had no obligation for them to come running when they needed help. That being said though, claiming that the blood elves of Quel'Thelas are traitors because they joined the Horde is just fucking retarded. Truly the mindset of a fanboy who's refusing to look at things from both sides of the isle. ::)<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I might add, there were also those High Elves who felt too connected with the Alliance and decided to stick around when Quel'thelas seceded from the Alliance, which I'm fine with. However, when Quel'thelas was sacked by the Scourge and the Sunwell defiled by Arthas, what did they do? They chose to remain hiding abroad instead of going back to their former homeland and trying to help, so that's why I hold nothing but contempt for High Elves as they stand today as well as factions like the Silver Covenant.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Nagas had already made occasional appearances on the islands of Kul Tiras and were known as evil creatures that worship an old god and assaulted ships at sea, meaning that they were well known. But you are right when you say that Garithos pushed Kael'thas, and the Elves along with him, out of the Alliance, yet, who was benefited from the alliance will fall apart completely?<br />

<br />
<br />
Clearly? Clear to who? You with your tiny mind and absolute horrid way of twisting the lore around? Yes. To the rest of us, not so much. Garithos wasn't being controlled by anyone. He simply was a racist prick, a bad commander, a weakling, pretty much the Alliance version of Garrosh Hellscream. I am laughing at your attempts to make excuses for him. ::)</div></div><hr />

Now that it's posted as news you will have players who think that it's proven true again when it's not.</div></div><hr />

I've been reading MMO champ for years but this actually made my blood boil so much I had to register and write here to let steam off<br />
<br />
One with deeply involved in the lore such as myself should be able to think these spoilers don't make much sense, or then Chris has totally fucked up the lore in WoW and only thing he cares about is how can they make more money out of wow, which is really sad.<br />
<br />
First off when Cairne was a major helper for Thrall and the orcs in Kalimdor, Orgrimmar might not be Orgrimmar today if not with the help of Cairne. The tauren chieftain also helds orcs in pretty high regard and are very close allies with 'em. I can't think at the moment why Garrosh would kill the leader of his biggest ally when he is going to declare a war against the Alliance, this seems very stupid and even though Garrosh is reckless and hot headed I don't think he is this stupid.<br />
<br />
Second, Cairne is considered as one of the most powerful mortals in the wow lore. I simply can't fathom the idea that someone like young orc Garrosh would be able to get Cairne, no this tauren is would hand Garrosh ass back to him pretty much instantly. Also I'm pretty sure other taurens wont just stand there and watch when their leader is being labeled as traitor and is demanded as executed. <br />
<br />
Third, how in the hell is Thrall going to be Guardian of Tirisfal, he is not mage and that spot is already reserved for Med'an. Are we gonna see fuck up in the lore again act as if Med'an never was?<br />
<br />
Last but certainly not least. Do you guys remember Garrosh's and Saurfang's dialogue in Warsong Hold. Saurfang told Garrosh that should he ever go into the &quot;dark path&quot; which can mean few things, war against alliance is one for sure, he would kill Garrosh before that day comes. I don't even want to think what kind of fate Saurfang has in Cataclysm if all these spoilers are true.<br />
<br />
Lore is a big thing for me since few games really have this deep and rich lore. Seeing it being changed to cater gameplay and how to get more money out of the game is honestly, very very sad thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I really hope this is how it turns out and we kill Garrosh in the end. However knowing Blizzard they have said many things which wouldn't ever happen but wait long enough and those words don't hold true anymore.</div></div><hr />

That said, the only things that are really up for debate here are tiny, tiny details. We can work out from the changes to quests in the PTRs that Cairne is going away SOMEhow. Does he die?

Need to remember that she asked Thrall to only be the shaman representative but he sent Rehgar Earthfury instead. Also the instance info isn't new either and is based on a slide from Blizzcon where they told us the instances (Grim Batol is a release raid http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/3/35/DungeonListCata.jpg). Cairne most likely just leaves to help Thrall leaving his son in charge. This stuff matters since it's spreading misinformation that is not confirmed by Blizzard which people than take as the gospel.</div></div><hr />

Since MMO-Champ got this from SA to begin with (and I don't blame you for thinking a usually-reliable (?) source was being reliable Boubouille) then this is really just circular journalism. <br />
<br />
That said, the only things that are really up for debate here are tiny, tiny details. We can work out from the changes to quests in the PTRs that Cairne is going away SOMEhow. Does he die? Maybe, maybe not. But he's not likely to be in TB anymore. You'll miss him either way, no? Or Thrall being the new Guardian of Tirisfal--a lot of people are saying it will be Med'an. They aren't just reinstating the Guardian of Tirisfal, but the Council of Tirisfal as well, are they not? And they've said in the comics that they're opening it up to druids, shaman, and priests/paladins--Jaina specifically said she'd ask Thrall to be a part of it. So Guardian or not, Thrall is going to be involved in the new Council of Tirisfal in some way. Most of the rest of this stuff (i.e. Orgrimmar getting a new ironclad look, LFGuild interface, flying mounts in Deepholme) was confirmed at Blizzcon. I think the only brand new information is that Cataclysm will ship with 8 heroics and 4 raids. Whoopee.<br />
<br />
Why do the tiny storyline details matter so MUCH to some of you when it's far from being relevant yet? It's a bit senseless. We'll all find out eventually. Stop bickering.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because I like stories, and I like them to make sense. Blizzard has been telling (and slightly changing as time went on, granted) a story for most of the last 12 years. The characters vary in quality, as do the plot lines, but in general the story has made sense. Setting up Med'an to be Guardian of Tirisfal only to replace him at the last second with Thrall for no apparent reason is not good storytelling. Having Garrosh execute Cairne for betrayal, then having his son take over leadership of the Taurens and continue as if nothing had happened is not good story telling. <br />
<br />
People in stories are supposed to act in coherent rational ways. Evil people might perform evil acts, irresponsible people might perform irresponsible acts, stupid people may do stupid things, but in general characters should act like themselves. A society that is based on reverence for its elders is highly unlikely to react well to the execution of its revered elder chief. A son in that society is highly unlikely to react well to the killing of his father. The only way such a thing would be accepted by the Taurens would be if incontrovertible proof of betrayal was presented. If Cairne really did betray the Horde, then it would be completely out of character for him.<br />
<br />
Same with the Guardian thing. Thrall has already turned down a position on the Council, why would he suddenly do such an about face as to no only accept the Council spot, but become Guardian? Why would Med'an give up the position? Why would Blizzard kill off Med'an after making such a big deal out of building him up? <br />
<br />
If the information in the article is correct, it is going to involve a lot of very tortured story telling on Blizz's part. It doesn't make sense from what we know now, so they are going to have to spin a lot of things very differently to make it work. It may happen that way, I'm no more psychic the Boub, but until I see a blue post confirming it, or it shows up in the game, I'm not biting. If it does turn out that the information is accurate, there better be some really fancy and special lore telling us why or I'm going to be highly disappointed.</div></div><hr />

Sounds to realistic for a computergame? Allow me to remind you that we are going to have a Nightelf wedding, after all. ::)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">seth82</div><div class="date">2010-03-12, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pure speculation of course, but it really didnt make much sense to me adding two capital citys one per side. Especially if you take into account how close in proximity gnomeragn and ironforge are and how many under populated capitals there are. What if at the start of cataclysm ironforge gets destroyed, and at the same time Garrosh stages a coup of some sort in ogrimarr. killing Caine and declaring you the player as some sort of traitor also. Then turning both citys into combat zones and possably even having raid ties. If Garrosh somehow managed to kill Caine and declared war on the alliance it seems fairly obvious that both factions would want to take him out as quick as possible.<br />
<br />
Blizz is telling a story, I'd say give them a chance to tell one before getting all crazy about it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Losbasterdos</div><div class="date">2010-03-12, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha, I love the amount of nerdraging people in denial in this thread.<br />
<br />
Did any of you even for a moment before going off in a foaming stream of incoherent NO!-screams consider the fact that Boubouille has been in contact with the PC Gamer editors? And, after said little chatter, he still chose to post the leak on the front page of this most esteemed website. This likely means that;<br />
<br />
<br />
1) PC Gamer have confirmed that they have other sources than <br />
Boubouille's Cataclysm leak<br />
<br />
Why would they wait until this point in time with writing an article if the only source they had was Boubouille's leak from August last year anyway? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Boubouille has checked this leak with his, as time has proven numerous <br />
times, very reliable sources at Blizzard <br />
<br />
He is not exactly known for posting unfounded rumours on his website, as time has also proven numerous times.<br />
<br />
<br />
I conclude, the stuff in this leak will turn out to be true. Any donkey with half a brain could have reached the same conclusion through logic and half a minute of (gasp!) thinking.<br />
<br />
Also, stop the senseless kneejerk whining about Cairne. Yes, lore progresses, and yes, Blizzard actually have the balls to kill off major lore characters that aren't bad guys. However, how on earth do you reach the conclusion that his death will not make sense? Nobody knows the full context of the execution yet. As was pointed out a few points ago, people were raging about the supposed incoherence of the Wrathgate plot too, but I think most people agree that it worked out pretty well. <br />
<br />
Warcraft is a billion-dollar franchise. A literal goldmine. Blizzard aren't about to fuck it up. You think they already have? Then perhaps you should stop caring, because 11 million people are still paying their monthly subscriptions to play it. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Amen!</div></div><hr />

<br />
During Warcraft Original Beta, both the Gnome and Troll races where added as an afterthought, and dumped together with existing races that happened to be close to the location they have held in lore before that. Only took Blizzard +- 6 years to give these two races their own individual spot in the world.</div></div><hr />

I could be retarded and say &quot;I stopped reading right there,&quot; but it would be a lie--I read through the rest of your post, yet it was all tainted by this first simple phrase.<br />
<br />
If you like stories so much, why not wait for Blizzard to tell the story before passing judgement? If it's wrong, let it be wrong and wait for the right story to come out. If it's right, sit back and go &quot;hmm&quot; and give Blizzard a chance to make all this make sense to us. Either way, fighting about it on forums just makes everyone involved look idiotic--raging that WAAA IT DUNT MAKE SENNNNSE isn't going to change the story. People who claim to be bickering because they love the story so much can't honestly expect anyone to believe them. You're all just looking for a fight. :\</div></div><hr />

You do realise that they are the biggest trolls on the internet, right?<br />

You do realise that you just got trolled by them, right?<br />

I'm mostly alliance, but I just cannot condone killing off Cairne. :'( Especially by an idiot like Garrosh. &gt;:(<br />
If Cairne is to die, it should be a very honorable end for a honorable figure.<br />

<br />
No matter how often you were right, you can always be wrong the next time.<br />
Actually, I think I remember him admitting he fell for some fake once, can't recall exactly when, but it was about between a half and a full year ago.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthMuffin</div><div class="date">2010-03-12, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing that annoys me with that is that Cairne didn't get to do anything since WoW's launch, despite the fact that we was a relatively important character in Warcraft 3. Heck, even Vol'jin got 5 minutes of glory by standing outside Undercity during the siege. Cairne on the other hand got a bit fat 0. <br />
<br />
Hopefully it's true that he will have a role to play with Desolace, and might get a bit of screen time right before his death. Still a waste of a perfectly fine character though.</div></div><hr />
