Mythic Gul'dan Kill Video<br />
Limit (https://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/illidan/Limit) finally got the 5th (US 1st) Mythic Gul'dan kill, so Exorsus (https://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%84%D1%8C%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B4/%D0%AD%D0%BA%D0%B7%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%81%D1%83%D1%81) released their Mythic Gul'dan kill video today. <br />

Nerf boulderfist and put it into your 2 set, 4 set buffing our already awful AoE. The irony being that the T19 4 set gives us 40% crits on SS. Even with a buffed CL, we always use it on CD when there's 2 mobs so they really have to be buffed immensely to outpower our previous tier.</div></div><hr />

It's not a radar addon or anything ? just tracks Debuffs on a target. (or something similar).</div></div><hr />

It is probably some kind of nameplate addon... you can hook things on them and they follow the players ...<br />
<br />
Clever use of addons but i expect new limitations in that regard in the future. And to the players... you really want to play a game of watch the colored balls?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also: I really liked the video. Great edit. Fun to watch. Also fun to watch is the SK Gaming vs Kil'Jaeden Video... music and voices at the end...</div></div><hr />

<br />
They broke all add-ons that could track range/radar, however these add-ons seem to be just visually marking (with circles) players who have a certain buff/debuff, which doesn't require radar functionality (as you can see the circles are always on players).<br />
<br />
These addons are allowed but they arn't open to the public, exorsus (and many other top guilds) have personal addon makers on their roster (exorcus specifically thanked the guy in their post-WF interview) and they have a competitive interest in not releasing them.<br />
<br />
Having said that, the vast majority of these kinds of add-ons are based on either a nameplate addon or are essentially a weakauras string from what I understand.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BananaHandsB</div><div class="date">2017-02-15, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's pretty clear this is the exact type of addon functionality blizzard has tried to block when they broke AVR and removed range # queries. In the end, you get the same functionality when it comes to range. Since you can still query what players are within a certain range (just not receive a #) and then highlight them with an orb on their nameplate, you get the same functionality as having a radar. The giant green lines across the screen in the last phase are even more blatantly against blizzard's addon functionality philosophy. I'm not saying ban em, or take away their kill, etc, but not releasing the addon after the kill just screams &quot;we know this shit shouldn't be allowed&quot;. At least let the rest of the community use it before blizzard breaks it for the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

Certainly against the spirit of what Blizzard is trying to avoid having, but it's going to be almost impossible to break without either making nameplates inaccessible entirely to addons, or disabling a lot of functionality while in raid instance, combat, or raid boss combat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exorsus said in their interview that it's been common practice in the world race for the winners to wait for 5 guilds to kill the last boss before they release their video. It's courteous. The people who released the video before now were breaking the tradition.<br />
<br />
That was a cool video, but I bet Blizzard will move to change that nameplate addon business. I'm not saying it's against the rules, but it definitely looks like a loophole rather than something that is outright allowed.</div></div><hr />

Man it's almost like it's not finished or something. Or that it's early in the testing. Crazy shit huh? <br />
<br />
And did you really say Fury is a longtime underperformer? They've been a top spec out of how many tiers now? Over 75% I'd say. Try being a shitty Elemental shaman where you've never had that honor last.</div></div><hr />
