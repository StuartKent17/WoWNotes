Armory Updated<br />
An updated version of the Armory went live today! It includes most of the features on the old character profile pages and features an updated design.<br />
<br />

Potential New Book - Troll Wars<br />
A listing appeared on the French version of Amazon (https://www.amazon.fr/World-Warcraft-Trollkriege-Paul-Kemp/dp/3833235373/) for &quot;World of Warcraft: Die Trollkriege (https://www.amazon.fr/World-Warcraft-Trollkriege-Paul-Kemp/dp/3833235373/)&quot; by Paul Kemp. Keep in mind that this is not an official announcement. <br />
<br />
Following the legendary War of the Ancients, a group of Night Elven magi were banished from their homeland. They looked for new land to settle on the coast of Lordaeron. At this time, the area was already settled by several loosely-allied weak tribes, while the Troll race had an advanced civilization. The arrival of the foreign Magi and their alliance with the Human race lay the foundation to one of the most serious conflicts Azeroth had ever witnessed, a conflict that would be known throughout history as the Troll Wars (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Troll_Wars).<br />
<br />
<br />
World Boss - Ana-Mouz<br />
Be sure to kill Ana-Mouz in Suramar for chance at item level 860 items and a Fel Relic (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/141520-imp-eye-diamond). <br />
<br />
<br />

The Legion Dungeon Event is live this week!<br />

<br />
You will get one extra piece of loot from the final dungeon boss on difficulties below Mythic+.<br />
Pick up Emissary of War (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44171-emissary-of-war) from Archmage Timear (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) in Dalaran to earn Cache of Nightborne Treasures (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140152-cache-of-nightborne-treasures)<br />
This quest requires you to clear 4 Mythic(+) dungeons and rewards Heroic Nighthold loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
All week, open Group Finder (default hotkey: i) and then select Dungeon Finder to queue for any Legion dungeon on Normal or Heroic difficulty. Alternately, get a group of veteran dungeoneers together and travel to one of the Legion dungeons on Mythic difficulty:<br />
<br />

Neltharion’s Lair<br />
Vault of the Wardens <br />
<br />
<br />
Look for the following all week long:<br />
<br />
<br />
Archmage Timear (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44171-emissary-of-war) for you. Or, if you forget to pick it up there, you can start it from within the Adventure Journal. <br />
<br />
Quest requirement: Complete 4 Legion dungeons on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Rewards: One loot box containing a piece of gear from Heroic difficulty Nighthold. <br />

1. Mobile trash aka unuseful for the demographic WoW is set for (PC). There are already better mobile feed apps available.<br />
2. It removed more information. Remember how they retarded up the character stat panel? Well this is the same thing.<br />
3. We're beta testing shit while they &quot;improve it&quot; with no opt-out choice.</div></div><hr />

It's already been discussed numerous times that it was just filler and that the team did not have time to create something as great as the Suramar campaign. It doesn't excuse what they've done but they are obviously aware of it and you should not be so negative when they knew what they did all along. It was never meant to be a great story campaign, people just blindly expected that without reading into it.</div></div><hr />

Not my favorite but I guess it's the thing to do these days. <br />
<br />
The loss of info like it's listed on the frontpage is more of a problem. Nothing added like relics or even AP is just vexing. Seems like they only had a graphic designer work on it and forgot to add functionality.<br />
<br />
Also no ratings for crit/haste/mastery/versatility. Just percentages.<br />
No overall stats for leech / avoidance / speed.</div></div><hr />

Who cares about the look when so many informations are gone? Instead upgrade we got big downgrade in my opinion. The old version not only had much more informations but was also &quot;cleaner&quot; and more readable.</div></div><hr />

My first thought was: Wow, did someone google translate that from chinese and that's why it reads like almost everything is gone now? Nah they actually just threw half the information out the window o.O<br />
Reeks of tablent and phone peasant optimization. <br />

As far as the Armory update? Someone needs to get fired. NOW. Page links not working, images missing, half the data gutted? WTF was someone thinking?!?!<br />
<br />
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/malfurion/simca/collections/pets Scroll down to their Legionnaire Murky, or go to the second page and look at Mischief. Seems like they need to hire the graphics dev from WoWhead....</div></div><hr />

i think you missed that blizzard remade the website, and this person made their version of the armory based on the websites redesign, so of corse they are going to look &quot;semi alike&quot; since they are both based off the same designs<br />
<br />
ask 2 people to make a car using the same exact parts, they will prob come out looking pretty similiar</div></div><hr />

It also mirrors what you see in-game, so the information you’re getting is not just easier to access, but makes logical sense when switching from in-game to IRL. Your gear has the same tooltips and you can see enchants, transmog info, gems, enhancements, and stats at a glance. Don’t you look good? Scroll a little way past your character and you’ll discover talents, raid progression and Player vs Player overviews. More on all of that below.&quot;<br />
<br />
Who the fk cares if I look beautiful or not on a webpage with my videogame character? They can replace my character with a picture of a potato all I care. I want armory that provides useful information about my own and others characters. And they just decided to remove a majority of the useful information. GG wp</div></div><hr />

i think you missed that blizzard remade the website, and this person made their version of the armory based on the websites redesign, so of corse they are going to look &quot;semi alike&quot; since they are both based off the same designs<br />
<br />
ask 2 people to make a car using the same exact parts, they will prob come out looking pretty similiar<br />
<br />
They are considerably different imo, apart from slight image semblances. I for one, however, would have MUCH preferred the fan made version, like, 100-1 preferred...</div></div><hr />

<br />
•	You can no longer search or filter the Pets and Mounts listing.<br />
•	There are no lists for heirlooms and the toy box collections<br />
•	Professions data is gone.<br />
•	Raid Progression completion bars for Throne of Thunder and The Bastion of Twilight aren't accurate.<br />
•	Arena Win and Loss counts are gone.<br />
•	The current title a character is displaying is gone.<br />
•	Recent activity is gone.<br />
•	Talents no longer have tooltips.<br />
•	Achievement statistics are gone.<br />
•	Other spec talents are gone.<br />
<br />
Hopefully you love the new changes as much as we do:)<br />
<br />
Blizzard just cant help themselves; class and spec pruning in game has been such a delight that they now have flowed the nonsensical pruning outside of the game.</div></div><hr />

Ah, that stinks for those that need specific bosses for appearance unlocks.</div></div><hr />

This isn't even a downgrade, it's them taking the chainsaw to it. A lot of people liked the whole listing of mounts, achievments etc. They're all gone and there was ZERO reason for them to remove it.</div></div><hr />

The straight ahead angle is lousy for displaying either.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valqt</div><div class="date">2017-05-13, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">New armory looks so bad and is missing a lot of information the old one did have. I don't really understood web designer's obsession with making everything so big these days, same goes for the WoW main page - I mean wtf is up with having every element take up the entire screen and then putting everything in one single page so it's just a major scroll-fest? It's such a clusterfuck and doesn't give a clear overview whereas the old pages did. Scale it down by like 30% or so and please bring back the filters for collections. :(<br />
<br />
I do love the new backgrounds for the armory though.</div></div><hr />
