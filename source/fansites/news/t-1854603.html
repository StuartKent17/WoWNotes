Arena Skirmishes Bonus Weekend August 28 - 31<br />
Next week is the Wrath of the Lich King timewalking event. Patch 6.2.2 and the new Timewarped Badge system will be live by then as long as nothing changes!<br />
Through the end of the day on Monday, Arena Skirmishes award triple bonus honor. There’s never been a better time to queue up for the Arena and crack some skulls. Keep an eye out for the event-only quest The Arena Calls. When you win 10 Arena matches, the quest awards 500 Conquest Points which do not count against your weekly Conquest Point maximum.<br />
<br />
In case you’ve never participated in an Arena Skirmish, here’s an easy how-to guide:<br />
<br />
<br />
From anywhere in-game, open the Group Finder (default hotkey: i)<br />
Select the Player vs. Player tab on the bottom of the window.<br />
Under Arena Battles, choose either 2v2 or 3v3.<br />
Click the Join Battle button to be matched up with teammates. <br />
<br />
<br />
It’s Arena PvP! Rush in and bash your opponents.<br />
<br />
Will you answer the call to battle?<br />
<br />
<br />
This Month in WoW – September 2015<br />
September is here, and summertime is coming to an end. This month is chock-full of festivities, celebrations, and heated PvP action as we draw closer to BlizzCon 2015. Here’s a peek at some of the fun you can have!<br />
<br />
In-Game Events<br />
<br />
Darkmoon Faire Returns [September 6-13]<br />
The wondrous and mystical Darkmoon Faire returns to Azeroth on September 6, and if you haven’t completed all of Silas Darkmoon’s new Darkmoon Races, now’s the time! Test your speed and agility on a variety of racing mounts as you dodge electrifying obstacles and zip all over Darkmoon Island for rewards and achievements. You may also want to take a few moments to be a kid again by going for a ride on the new Darkmoon Seesaw.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The faire continues to be one of the best ways to acquire heirloom gear, and don’t forget all of the toys, mounts, and pets that can only be gotten here. Get in that cannon!<br />
<br />
Pirates’ Day [September 19-20]<br />
Every year on this one day, Captain DeMeza lands at the goblin town of Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale, attempting to recruit land-lubbers into her buccaneer ranks. Don’t miss your chance to visit her or her henchmen in the capital cities. New for this year is the Big Bag of Booty. Be the Robin Hood of pirates by purchasing this one-time-use item which you can toss into the streets to help distribute piles of gold to those most in need. Yarr!<br />
<br />

<br />
Brewfest [September 20-October 6]<br />
Celebrated by both the Horde and the Alliance, Brewfest is a time to enjoy the fermented fruits of the harvest: pretzels, cheese, and brew! The competing breweries Thunderbrew, Barleybrew, and the Ogres, all come together outside of all the major cities in a bid to outdo each other with their special ales, meads, and beers. Brave adventurers are invited to sit back, take a pull, and sample the finest wares these brewers have to offer!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/august/thumb/tmin03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/august/tmin03.jpg) <br />
<br />
Brewfest is your only chance to acquire the Swift Brewfest Ram and Great Brewfest Kodo mounts, as well as the Wopertinger and Pin-Sized Pink Pachyderm pets. It’s also your chance to get your brew-covered mitts on a few new items: the Stout Alemental pet, and the Steamworks Sausage Grill and Brewfest Banner toys!<br />
<br />
Harvest Festival [September 21-28]<br />
The Harvest Festival is a time to commemorate those who have sacrificed their lives to help their allies. Throughout history, many have given their lives to that end. Every year, members of the Horde and the Alliance set aside time to honor the memories of the fallen, and to pay tribute to those whose memories are held most dear: Uther Lightbringer, for the Alliance, and Grommash Hellscream, for the Horde.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/august/thumb/tmin04.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/august/tmin04.jpg) <br />
<br />
Members of the Alliance show their respect by lighting a candle at the Tomb of Uther Lightbringer in the Western Plaguelands. while members of the Horde show their respect to Grommash Hellscream by leaving a bottle of spirits at the base of the Hellscream Memorial in Demon Fall Canyon in Ashenvale.<br />
<br />
But your determination to pay respects to the dearly departed doesn’t stop there! Show your patriotism by earning a new Spiritshard which will transforms you into an Anxious, Vengeful, Forlorn, or Peaceful spirit. It’ll be your chance to truly feel the emotions of those who have paid the ultimate price.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
.Does LFR Archimonde drop the Ring upgrade?<br />
No, Crystallized Fel is only available on Normal difficulty and above. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/636283033914466304))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
The biggest difference with ranked solo queue would be having a rating attached and MMR.<br />
Keep in mind conquest does not exist in 7.0. Skirmish will provide honor and gear. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/635942319280099328))<br />
I would certainly love to hear more ideas about how we can improve Ground Finder too. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/635954384933793793))<br />
One common misconception about ranked solo queue is &quot;I will only get great teammates!&quot; (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/635954754833616896))<br />
<br />
But those good geared players do queue rated solo queue<br />
The reward systems are different in 7.0 (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/635962117334564864))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Can I ask you, how much has the WoW team changed since WotLK?<br />
Not much. The leadership team stayed virtually the same the whole time I was there. Some folks went to Titan and several came back. The team was growing the entire time so you always saw a lot of new faces, but they were additions, not replacements. Reading between the lines a bit, I don't think this is one of those deals where some kind of new team radically evolved the philosophy. Blizzard turnover, even between teams, is very low by industry standards. <br />
<br />
Why do Blizzard devs think anyone who disagrees with their direction or believes previous iterations of WoW were superior are blinded by rose colored glasses?<br />
I can't speak for them, obviously. I will say as a game developer on a long-running game such as LoL or WoW or even Age of Empires, you tend to hear in about roughly equal proportions &quot;this feature is flawed and stale, please update it&quot; and &quot;this feature was better before, please revert it.&quot; Thus, it's possible to often feel like you are fighting nostalgia, which might make you perceive it even when that isn't the player's specific feedback at the moment.<br />
<br />
You don't tend to hear &quot;this feature is perfect, please don't change it,&quot; because content customers don't tend to post on social media, but you hear plenty of &quot;this feature was perfect - why did you change it?&quot; <br />

Final Fantasy XIV - 5 Million Accounts<br />
Earlier this month Square Enix announced that FFXIV is up to 5 million accounts (not active subscribers)! For comparison, World of Warcraft hit 100 million in December 2013 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3722-WoW-Infographic-Bonus-Rolls-Jan-28-Hotfixes-PTR-Notes-Update-Blue-Posts-Giveaway). <br />

FFXIV is pretty niche. It has its popularity but there are a large amount of factors that will drive people far away. It will get popular and stay there, but will prob never hit WoW numbers.</div></div><hr />

Going at the same pace they have going at it would only take them 20 years to beat wow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The recent 5 million number from FFXIV is not active subscribers. Its the number of people who had 1. Bought the game and 2. Subscribed at least 1 month.<br />
<br />
WoW had hit 100 million of this same number, neither number for FFXIV or WoW is including trial accounts.<br />
<br />
FFXIV (although this is an estimated quote from someone else) is estimated to have about 1.2mil currently active subscribers. Given the fuckload of bots though I'd put it around 1.1mil</div></div><hr />

how is this worthy of a comment? You've been here since 2009... it was always and will always be a Blizzard Fansite... and it's called MMO-Champion because it mostly focuses on World of Warcraft, which is the champion of MMOs :) <br />

Then please present your numbers<br />
<br />
WoW had 12 million subs in WotLK....so &quot;taking a zero away&quot; is already not working. At the time of the 5 year interview, Pob Pardo mentioned that even then already 2-3 times the number of active subs had passed through the game. <br />
<br />
And there are links in this news....while you submit nothing to back your claims up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How much of a shill for Blizzard this makes mmo-champ look like. Something to note, mmo-champ rarely if ever posts FFXIV news, so this tiny little tidbit comes off as nothing more than an attempt to step on FFXIV's toes, when SE has kept themselves, done their own thing, ever recovering from their admitted failure to produce a quality product a few years ago, and in the midst of their growing success with a project they completely did from the ground up in order to please their fans.<br />
<br />
I don't actively play the game or anything, but I at least respect what they've done as a consumer, but that quick little &quot;comparison&quot; to WoW on a piece of data that seems all to un-important to the modern day MMO-Champ repertoire for updates just seemed out-of-place.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but this comment felt so back-handed, smarmy. I don't even play FFXIV and I could still smell the salt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How much of a shill for Blizzard this makes mmo-champ look like. Something to note, mmo-champ rarely if ever posts FFXIV news, so this tiny little tidbit comes off as nothing more than an attempt to step on FFXIV's toes, when SE has kept themselves, done their own thing, ever recovering from their admitted failure to produce a quality product a few years ago, and in the midst of their growing success with a project they completely did from the ground up in order to please their fans.<br />
<br />
I don't actively play the game or anything, but I at least respect what they've done as a consumer, but that quick little &quot;comparison&quot; to WoW on a piece of data that seems all to un-important to the modern day MMO-Champ repertoire for updates just seemed out-of-place.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but this comment felt so back-handed, smarmy. I don't even play FFXIV and I could still smell the salt.<br />
<br />
This!!!! Sad really. I detest ffxiv also catered to the kids after ffxi but it's an amazing game that shows you don't need years for content and can still have amaZing graphics with a mediocre PC.<br />
<br />
That being said. 100 million... In 2013 they had around 10 million. Definitely a typo. It hasn even as high as 12 since the start of wotlk. Just like wod had almost double the subs at launch as it does now. <br />
<br />
The fanboys who spin on blizzards finger have no idea what an mmorpg even is.. They just eat this cake all day.<br />

If you would ever go to that infographic from 2013 you could read there, that 100m in that time was with trial accounts. According to IGN that announced 4m earlier this year it was without trials, but it really sounds weird to me, because registered account is also a trial, but I will assume that IGN is telling the truth. This means that WoW had 100m(2013) with trials and FF has 5m without trials<br />

<br />
Also, WoW has never had 100m. I think that's a typo, one too many zeros.<br />
<br />
I suppose they may say WoW from its start (2004-today) might have 100m. They may combine any type of account WoW involves (sub/starter account etc.)<br />
Judging on those facts it MAY be a believable number...<br />
Still FF14 has 5m active accounts... and WoW has...maybe 6-7m (i do believe about 5m though, i think i saw it somewhere but can't remember where).<br />
The thing is... WoW is losing players and it will lose even more players if they won't up their quality and do something about their prices/ pay model as well. The new expansion seems promising, so i believe they will up their numbers in about next expansions launch or a month later ... But if next expansion goes as WoD did, even more players will leave, so the number will go down from 5m active accounts...in other words if FF14 keeps rising, we will possibly have a new &quot;king&quot; after...10+ years. And that's a first time in MMO-RPG genre history a game actually is a threat to WoW. <br />
On the other hand, if WoW has competition, they can do things to improve the game in many ways... not like they did 2 (or 3) expansions now,where they demoted the game...<br />
<br />
Also judging facts, blizzard always finds a way to overdo it in numbers and we can't check them out as well...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway I wonder if those FF14 numbers also include Trial accounts :-?<br />
<br />
Actually the 100M account in WoW does include trial accounts (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/12346804/world-of-warcraft-azeroth-by-the-numbers-28-01-2014) while FFXIV doesn't.</div></div><hr />

I only included it in the hopes that people would read and understand the difference between accounts and active subscribers. Directly comparing an older MMO to a newer one would make no sense at all. I have nothing against it and clearly they are doing relatively well, which is why I included the news.<br />

It annoys me each time people mistake overall accounts for active subscriptions, the games doing well but not that well<br />
<br />
This is no different then when Blizzard come out with quarter numbers for WoW and they count everything and the kitchen sink as a active sub or account. One only has to to a look at the day to day average of people playing WoW in both the US and EU from WoWrealm to see that the average is not more than 1.1 -1.5 people actually playing the game each and every day. WoW does not currently have 5 million people playing the game they have 5 million active accounts.</div></div><hr />

Actually it is. Subscribed = paying users. Registered uses in a F2P mean = nothing. I've been working for a well known F2P 6 years, we've boasted these numbers, too. They seem impressive, but at the end of the day CCU and MAUs count.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's so true. Let's take my situation as an example. I've been playing wow since early 2007, stopped in WoD few months ago (couldn't stand garrisons and ships shit anymore). My subscription has expired 2 days ago. During those few months I logged 2 times to game just to realize how boring it is now and alt-f4'rd it right after. <br />
<br />
I'm not alone. My long time WoW friends who were excited when WoD was comming out are gone now. All of them.<br />
<br />
The boat is sinking and Blizzard does literally nothing to repair this situation. New expansion probably won't come out in the next 6-months, let's be honest. So there we have another ICC or SOO style long patch ahead.........................................<br />
<br />
Bumping numbers here won't help, really. WoW in it's current state is in a huge decline.</div></div><hr />

This is fairly simple. FFXIV has 5 million accounts that have been registered for the game. That is not active at the moment accounts. That is accounts registered to the game. I played it and don't have an active sub now so I count in those numbers. That number will never go down, it will always go up because you can't change the fact that you registered an account. <br />

WoW, has the same number, once you got the game and registered it....you can't UNDO that. It doesn't mean you are subscribed right now, it means you were at any point in time. And WoW has 100 million of these. <br />

At a recent event, SE said that the game has 97 billion hours total /played in its census (96,809,761,442) - compared to last year's 823 million. Google &quot;Eorzea Census 2015 Stream Slides,&quot; it'll be the first link. No quotes, of course.<br />
<br />
If 97b hours is true, then 5m active subscribers seems much more likely. <br />

Everything's still pretty new and such, but the story and characters are great, it runs smoothly and looks awesome. I don't mind some grind, what I mind is there being no content besides raiding that's even worth doing. I'm enjoying it very much over here at the moment but there's no need to play them off against each other like this. It's unnecessary, you can play more than one game. I'm actually glad FFXIV is doing so well, and hope that WoW improves.<br />
<br />
I have got an active WoW sub at the moment, but when that expires in a few days, I'll probably not renew. I've been playing since 2005 and feel a bit let down by Blizzard to be honest with WoD. Plus, playing the same game for 10 years, you're bound to get bored eventually. WoW doesn't &quot;suck&quot; per se; it is just not for me at the moment, because I'm not a hardcore raider.<br />

Each to their own, as always, but I'm really enjoying it at the moment and would love to see more coverage of it on MMO-C.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a big difference between WoW and FFXIV when it comes to dungeons. Dungeons in FFXIV are all scaled and level 50 players could get their random queue for any of the lower level dungeons. Before they implemented the Daily Random Duty Finder, which will queue you for any dungeon your level and lower, queues for dungeons were awful. But because of the fact that some dungeons are mandatory to continue questing they needed to entice more players to do low level dungeons so people wouldn't hit a road block in Story questing and not be able to continue. Whereas with WoW you can only queue for dungeons around your level which gives you access to a much much smaller pool. FFXIV's pool of players for dungeons is nearly any player high enough to do said dungeon.</div></div><hr />

As a pure and hyperbolic example let's take the often given &quot;100m WoW accounts&quot; number; that number is devoid and meaningless if, again only in theory, WoW only has 100k subs to go with that.<br />
<br />
I haven't played it in almost a year, but I'd obviously count in that statistic for example. Until such time as they give some real data on the matter it's entirely irrelevant, or at least to me it is. What I can tell though is that the number is obviously big enough to not only maintain the game, but continue to invest in it. That itself is a generally good sign regardless of their gun shy attitude towards revealing their real sub numbers.</div></div><hr />

Some people really love to argue over such stupid things to justify the game they play as relevant or better. Swear it's like two elementary kids bickering on a playground around here so often.<br />
<br />
It's like little kids when it comes to WoW players - but not other games. Only with WoW do you get insufferable little gits running around comparing other games to WoW, and crowing when WOW has better/different numbers. It's a bizarre mindset and attitude. I was on a different site the other day, completely unrelated to gaming, and a WoW comment was made - and then a flurry of posts happened with WoW players coming out of the woodwork and throwing around the WoW memes that are the bread and butter of this site. Another post made a comment later that crystalized it for me - &quot;It's like a cult, you mention that game, and hundreds of them show up and start chanting the same thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The longer I go not playing, the more I see how &quot;special&quot; WoW players are. I think it's why I get more and more at odds with the typical poster here, because I don't think that way anymore. FFX has more players? Cool. Oh, look, I stopped caring, that fast. <br />
<br />
I've seen a similar thing in the workplace, at companies like Kinkos and IKEA, where their training and company philosophies create a cult mindset - and WoW is pretty much the same thing. <br />
<br />
We now return you to the sandbox slap fight over the difference between &quot;registered&quot; and &quot;active&quot;. Have at it, kids. Slap away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think Blizzard is afraid of being dethroned per say, but it does seem like they've at least been trying to defuse some of XIV's momentum lately. The last two major WoW patches (6.1 and 6.2) were both released on the same day as major releases in XIV. Patch 6.0 was also released within a week's time of FFXIV's 2.4 patch.<br />
<br />
Patch 6.1 released on February 24th, the same day Square Enix released Patch 2.51 for XIV that included the Gold Saucer, which was a highly, highly anticipated feature for the game and had been heavily teased since launch. Making this move even more suspect, 6.1 was also the patch to add the mount racing mini-game to the Darkmoon Faire, perhaps to try and compete with the Chocobo Racing content at the Gold Saucer. <br />
<br />
Patch 6.2 then released on June 23rd, the same exact day as the official launch of Heavensward, FFXIV's first expansion. I had been playing early access for Heavensward for a few days at this point, so I did take some time check out Tanaan a bit that day, but XIV still won out in the end. As much as I enjoy WoW, a full expansion &gt; patch. Needless to say this was rather frustrating, as I would have really liked to have given 6.2 some more time when it launched.<br />
<br />
Could this just be a coincidence? Yeah, sure. But if this keeps happening moving forward it'll become quite difficult to not be at least a little bit suspicious.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. Former WoW subscriber here, from vanilla WoW until end of this July. I switched to FFXIV in spite of having 1 million gold in WoW (so I could have bought, what, 2 years of tokens?). And in spite of having to buy the starter game, the expansion, and pay a monthly fee. It reminds me of how I felt back in BC as a pally tank. I love tanking dungeons and I love tanking dungeons in FFXIV. It is a good game, imo. Not for everyone, of course, but it makes this former WoW player very happy!</div></div><hr />

Don't even think it was downplaying FF's achievement but instead an attempt to prevent a million threads being opened about FFXIV taking WoW's place as the top MMO. We may never know the actual subscription numbers of FFXIV because they don't release those but in comparison to the WoW number of accounts and WoW being older it's probably somewhere in the range of 1 or 2 million active accounts, so at best 30ish percent of WoW's current player base.</div></div><hr />

It means much more to me that when I log in to FFXIV I have friends and just other players to do stuff with, which isn't the case in WoW lately. <br />
<br />
Also FFXIV just had the &quot;rising tide&quot; event and part of it is a special message from the developers. It was actually heartwarming to read the quest text about how much the devs care about the game. How they realized their hubris with the first iteration of the game, and remade it so that the gameworld is both the players and devs vision. They really seem to see their fans as friends rather than foe. I'm not sure the same is true for Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I do not think that WoW will drop dramatically, it could. Look at how quickly WoW grew when it initially came out. Unlike a lot of other games that have tried, ff14 is growing by leaps and bounds over the last two years while remaining a sub game, something star wars, wildstar, and various other games have failed to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, WoW has never had 100m. I think that's a typo, one too many zeros.<br />
<br />
That tweet is from Square Enix(The company that made the fucking game) It says, given you seem to not be able to read: 5 million &gt;registered&lt; accounts. That is not the same as active. <br />
<br />
100m registered accounts for WoW, not active. Even if you took the 0 away, that would be 10m, which is lower than wrath.<br />

I dont think it really matters. They are still a business and that's a perfectly legit business strategy. Even then, if you're playing FF14 and enjoying it, are you going to sub to wow just to dick about at the darkmoon faire? Afaik, Chocobo racing&gt; darkmoon racing anyway.<br />

Also, if you're enjoying FF14 and the expansion just launched, which you just bought, why would you stop playing to do Tannan jungle?</div></div><hr />

They compared it to WoWs account numbers so it would be easier for dumb fucks to understand what registered accounts means as everyone knows 100 million people aren't actively playing WoW. If they used any other game it would be harder to distinguish active subs vs registered accounts(and many dont give out active sub numbers) and we would get even more threads on how FF has 5 million people actively playing and will over take WoW in a month or 2.</div></div><hr />

Not to bash FFXIV, but those are the facts. I also think it's good that another MMO is doing well.

Let's be real here, WoW still is a giant compared to FFXIV by numbers alone. 5 million accounts is nothing to sneeze at, but WoW is a pop culture phenomenon. Besides, people don't seem to know the difference between account numbers and subscription numbers, so clarifying this is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

Looks like how I expected: 20 minutes of live actors, 90 minutes of CGI. I assume that's why the studio has been all fussy about releasing an official trailer. Seems pretty polished though so hopefully a proper HD trailer is imminent.<br />
<br />
blizzcon. it will be good and polished BUt I think they should have use costume and practical effect instead.</div></div><hr />

Warcraft Orcs simply would not work with practical effects, at least not in a way that would allow them to actually fight in anything resembling a fluid manner, they are just far too big and bulky for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
100m registered accounts for WoW, not active. Even if you took the 0 away, that would be 10m, which is lower than wrath.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I dont think it really matters. They are still a business and that's a perfectly legit business strategy. Even then, if you're playing FF14 and enjoying it, are you going to sub to wow just to dick about at the darkmoon faire? Afaik, Chocobo racing&gt; darkmoon racing anyway.<br />
<br />
Also, if you're enjoying FF14 and the expansion just launched, which you just bought, why would you stop playing to do Tannan jungle?<br />
<br />
No, you probably wouldn't. I just found it interesting. If they were in fact calculated moves by Blizzard I think it was more about keeping WoW players on WoW and less about getting XIV players to stop playing XIV and resub to WoW. <br />
<br />
In my particular case, my WoW sub was still active and I probably wasn't on WoW for more than an hour each time. In the case of 6.2 I just logged in ran around Tanaan for a bit to check it out and went back to playing Heavensward. It wasn't until about a month later that I actually started doing the Tanaan content regularly. Still, I would have liked for Tanaan to come out at some other time so I could have spent a more significant amount of time there at launch, but oh well.</div></div><hr />

Except you're ignoring the fact both companies are running on the same Quarter system so both of them have incentive to make releases like that.</div></div><hr />

There is no such a official report. We dont know about subs number it might be 1 player or 5 millions.<br />
But for sure people are playing the game and it's not going f2p any time soon.</div></div><hr />

You have no idea what you are wishing for.... costumes: /watch?v=FMJPwRWaZBI<br />
<br />
Just doesnt work, dude. There will never be realistic enough costumes for orcs that are twice the size of a human bodybuilder... it would look very amateurish.<br />
Even the best looking orc cosplay at this moment looks too thin to be in the official movie.<br />
<br />
And practical effects are impossible.... its not Narnia we are talking about here... none of the exotic animals in warcraft can be found in real life. Gryphons dont exist, dragons dont exist, giant wolves dont exist... only thing they dont need to CGI is horses, unless your gonna kill them...<br />
<br />
Puppetry only works for dead creatures... they dont have to move. It would look very out of place if one thing is a puppet and the rest is CGI. The movement fluidity just isnt there in todays puppet-technology.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Certainly. My original post though was in response to those who've been going on about Blizzard feeling threatened by XIV's success, so I mentioned the overlapping releases. <br />
<br />
While both companies do have incentive to overlap, in these particular cases it was Blizzard who placed their patches on top of dates that Square Enix had in place first. Dates that were in place months in advance even, in the case of Heavensward.</div></div><hr />

If people enjoy it that's cool more power to them but even if WoW gets a lot worse than it is now I could never see myself giving FFXIV another shot as long as that 2.5sec GCD exists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I played for 2 months around launch and frankly I found the game fairly boring.<br />
<br />
They might be thinking of numbers that have been pulled from the game's API, but they're still not 2-3 million. Google &quot;Jonathan Price XIV stats comparison,&quot; it's the first link. I'd directly link it here but I still have restrictions on posting URLs.<br />
<br />
That number of experienced players there is going to be pretty close to the actual number of subscribers, since level 50+ alts are virtually non-existent when you can access all classes and jobs on a single character. <br />
<br />
Also, these numbers only represent the global version of the game. They don't include players in China or Korea, as they play different versions of the game that are currently behind the global version in terms of content.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malackai</div><div class="date">2015-08-31, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone that has been playing WoW for nearly 10 years. I haven't got a single problem with the slower cd. that a some of the people are experiencing.<br />
<br />
Combat in a game is just something that I tend to get used to after a week or so.<br />
<br />
When I swapped WoW for Aion it took me a couple of days getting used to the combat there (there were quite some derpy moments with targeting)<br />
When I went from WoW to Tera it took me a week or so to get used to the battle mechanics and when I swapped back it took me some time to get back to the Tabtarget WoW controls (the amount of dismount deaths I had in that time was hilarious)<br />
When I went from WOW to ArcheAge it again took me some days to get used to the battle controls same when I swapped back again. (many jump of ledge deaths where to be had because I forgot I dint had a glider.)<br />
<br />
When I swapped from WoW to FF14 it took me a week or so to get into the slower mode. When I stopped playing FF14 during SoO (had some raid responsibilities) it took me a week to get used to the old WoW spammy mechanics again.<br />
<br />
I started playing FF14 again in the start of this year after playing some ArcheAge and after that WoD. It took me 2-3 evenings getting back in the saddle and that's with even picking up a high lv character. Granted the whole WoW battle mechanic was pretty much worn out of me at that point (only played WoW for 3 months or so the rest was Archeage they don't differ that much besides targeting).<br />
<br />
The point is I did try some WoW again after playing FF14. However this time I simply could not get used to the WoW Battle mechanics again. it has simply become to button smashy for my tastes. But it the fault the combat? No its the fact that this time there's nothing there to distract me enough to ignore the combat so my body and mind can get used to the combat again without me noticing. So now it sticks out like a sore thumb for me.<br />
<br />
So I Am really wondering if that might be the case with other people that simply cant get used to the FF14 mechanics. It might be that they are simply not invested or really interested enough to be able to ignore the combat for a while. So the body sort of can get used to it. Or perhaps they are unable to really look at the game with a clean slate and keep comparing things to WoW.<br />
<br />
Personally I never really had the tendency to compare games in a way like that. i always shed of the &quot;old game coat&quot; and just go in clear seeing what the game has to offer.<br />
<br />
Maybe I am just weird like that :P</div></div><hr />

Agreed.<br />
<br />
The active FF population around 4 months ago was only 730K, and I doubt it's increased a huge amount since then (if at all).<br />

<br />
Considering the fact that Square Enix has been operating Final Fantasy XI on a subscription model for well over 13 years now (and will be keeping subscriptions even after the game enters maintenance mode) and has been operating Dragon Quest X in Japan on a subscription model since 2012, there's no way XIV will go F2P when it already dwarfs their other two MMOs in players. FFXIV is not a flavor of the month game like many other MMOs have been; the Final Fantasy franchise is a brand with legitimate staying power and a very devoted fan base. The subscription model will continue for a long, long time so long as those currently enjoying the game are happy with it, which is definitely the case. <br />
<br />
Couple all that with Naoki Yoshida and the rest of the development team being very against F2P for XIV, as subscriptions allow them to keep a very steady stream of content, whereas earnings from F2P can be rather uncertain.</div></div><hr />
