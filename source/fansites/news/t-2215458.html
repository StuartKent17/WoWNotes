Armory Stats - Legion Flying Achievements<br />
Today we are taking a look at how players are doing at earning achievements required for flying in Legion. The chart below shows the percentage of players that have earned each achievement, with a total of 1.8 million US and EU accounts that were active in the last month.<br />
<br />
Flying should come in handy when class mounts (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6265-Patch-7-2-PTR-Build-23436-Class-Mount-Models) become available! If you haven't completed it yet, you can use our Flying Progress Tool (http://bna.mmo-champion.com/tools/flying/) to see what you have left!<br />

Raidbots - SimCraft in the Cloud<br />
Our friends over at Raidbots (https://www.raidbots.com/simbot) have put together an easy-to-use web-based UI for SimulationCraft that runs on powerful servers. It lets you do lots of comparisons, such as: <br />
<br />
<br />
Stat Weights (https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/stats) - Generate weights and Pawn strings for your character<br />
Gear Compare (https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/gear) - See if that new item is better, check out legendary combinations, and more<br />
Talent Compare (https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/talents) - Set up various builds and see which is best for different types of fights<br />
Relic Compare (https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/relic) - Sensing a pattern yet?<br />
Top Gear (https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear) - Find the best combination of gear from your bags.<br />
Advanced (https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/advanced) - run any SimulationCraft input, also works with addons like SimPermut, SimcTrinketComparison<br />
All of the features above can export the SimC input so you can run and modify on your own local copy of SimC<br />
<br />
<br />
If you haven't heard of it, SimulationCraft is an open source program which simulates WoW combat. It's one of many tools used by theorycrafters to figure out optimal rotations, gearing strategies, etc. It's also used to help determine custom stat weights, perform personal gear comparisons and more.<br />
<br />
The biggest challenge with SimulationCraft is that it has a learning curve, can require quite a bit of fiddling to get set up the way you want it, and is incredibly hungry for CPU power. Raidbots attempts to make it easier to do the more common tasks and run simulations on powerful servers.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Folks, including myself, are rather puzzled. We were told one thing during Blizzcon, then something that implied the opposite at this Q&amp;A. Some clarification would be appreciated. Many want to know if there's still plans to continue Vol'jin's story, as was hinted at last year.<br />
It was a light-hearted remark. Vol'jin IS dead, but of course there is much more story to tell when it comes to his legacy. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/858354085682061313))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler occasionally talks about WoW and game design, often providing topics for discussion. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
In the previous expansion, WoW introduced a talent for protection warriors that allowed them to have a DPS build and play as DPS. In your opinion, considering the role dynamics of WoW, what are the biggest downsides (design-wise) to have a tank spec being able to perform with a DPS build and what are some advantages? Do the benefits of that implementation outweigh the costs? Can you think of some other games you know (online or not, RPG or not) where that implementation might work great?<br />
This was Gladiator Stance, right? I didn’t work on that feature and don’t have any context on the intent.<br />
<br />
In general, it’s often a question of fairness. Is it okay for one tank spec to be able to do damage while the other tanks cannot? Do you then add the ability for paladins etc. do be able to do DPS in their tank spec? Even if you have to spend a point on the talent, presumably that still gives you a lot more flexibility with regard to gear and other talent points than say a paladin does. We even ran into this problem with Feral druids, which ultimately encouraged us to split the spec into separate melee DPS and tanking trees.<br />
<br />
You may recall, around the time of Lich King, we experimented with letting DKs tank with any spec. This was in an era when alts were still relatively challenging to level and gear up, and respecing was painful and expensive (though I still did it every week in (old) Karazhan). <br />
<br />
Adding dual-spec pretty much killed the need for this. I have mixed feelings about dual-spec. It definitely gave a lot of flexibility to players, and since the only cost of respecing was hassle, it made sense just to ease that hassle. But I definitely think it made each of our individual characters (not the classes, but the characters themselves) less unique. No longer did I have a Demonology warlock with (for better or worse) max ranks in Demonic Knowledge and Master Conjurer . I just had a warlock who could be whatever he wanted to be at any moment in time depending on the immediate needs of a boss fight or how much I wanted to PvP. Diablo 2 made you commit to your talent trees, and there was something kind of cool about that compared to the unparalleled flexibility of Diablo 3.<br />
<br />
I know that may sound like I just want to make life tougher for players, but that’s not really it. I think constraints can be a good thing for the game and ultimately more fun for players. It may just be hard to see that in the short term when it feels like the game is arbitrarily getting in the way of something you want to do. But it may feel like it in the long term when your character is something different from every other character in town.

<br />
The problem with the census data is that it's all volunteer reported data. If you look at the explanations of data on warcraftrealms.com you'll see there's only a couple of data points that are built on good data (100+ snapshots over a 30 day period). From their FAQ: <br />
&quot;Server X only has 10 people on Horde side! That can't be right, can it?<br />
No, it most definitely is not right, but it's not WarcraftRealms' fault, either! If you go to that server's page, it will most likely tell you there have been very few submissions in the last 30 days, and as only data from the last 30 days is included in most stats, that is the reason for the seemingly non-existant population. WarcraftRealms relies on submissions from players to keep information accurate, so where those submissions do not exist, sadly the accuracy is also lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, no you did not just read that there are 1.8 million active accounts. You read that there are 1.8 million accounts that reported data for that report.</div></div><hr />

I remember when respecing had a cost and we didn't have dual spec. People would instead have multiples of the same class. Now we can have 1 of the class (or 2 if we play both sides). Having 3-4 of a class to play each spec and potentially another one just for PvP causes burn out because every time an expansion hits you realize you have to level that same class 3-4 times. Then with Legion being so class based, you have to do the same class story 3-4 times. Well, 2 if you do 2 DHs. Now we can just have 1-2 of a class and swap quickly for whatever we're doing.<br />
<br />
Today's society demands we be flexible. We can go from our computers to our phones to a tablet in the blink of an eye. Nintendo Switch is a console that can become a handheld which I wouldn't be surprised to see similar functionality with the Playstation and Xbox at some point. Having inflexible toons goes against what our society is moving toward. Inflexibility only makes us feel like we're running into a large immovable rock. We should be allowed to change freely. This isn't the Middle Ages where we get burned at the state just because we state something like the Sun is the center of our solar system.<br />
<br />
There's nothing stopping you currently from picking talents and leaving them forever while having multiple toons of the same class to cover every spec and PvP. Blizzard gave us the option to change more freely. It's like flight. There's nothing stopping you from staying grounded even if there is flying. Meanwhile, removing flight does remove pro-fliers option to fly. Blizzard gave us an OPTION which is by no means required. Nothing is forcing you to change things constantly. You may feel you need to, but you can also decide to just stick with your original choice.<br />
<br />
I honestly can't remember the last time I changed a talent point. When I select one, it often stays until it gets refunded by Blizzard. I do change specs fairly frequently, though. At least I do on my shaman and druid. I don't miss the TBC and WotLK days of respec costs and no dual spec.<br />
<br />
And honestly, I found gladiator warriors insulting. I had a feral druid in TBC and WotLK (still have her actually). I enjoyed being able to swap between bear and cat in the same spec. When that got removed, I was pissed but dealt with it. I was then pissed when Blizzard effectively let warriors do that. If Blizzard wasn't going to let the other tanks do the same thing, then warriors shouldn't have had it to begin with. Do find it a bit irritating that Blizzard has a talent row for druids that lets you play another spec, though. Kind of defeats the point of dual spec. Waiting to see when that talent row gets changed. Why can resto druids just switch into moonkin and DPS when a resto shaman lost many of their DPS abilities with Legion? Blizzard's very inconsistent and it's rather frustrating to put it mildly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that flexibility/accessibility is great, especially in the current day and age. But I think Ghostcrawler was talking about the value of a specific spec, which can still be great to have today. Maybe not in the talent system, but definitely elsewhere.<br />
<br />
The &quot;gating&quot; that we often see in WoW today helps increase the value of certain things, such as BiS trinkets. The RNG behind getting the trinket you want increases the value of said trinket. If Blizzard suddenly gave us the ability to get the trinket that we wanted really quickly, the value of the item drops. Many high level players are still playing because they don't have optimal gear/trinkets yet, and likely would have burnt out long ago if their gear was easy to obtain. Yes it's frustrating to not be able to get the trinket, but once you finally get the trinket you want it feels amazing. Same could be said about Legendary items.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, having less flexibility increases the longevity of a game. But we still need to have flexibility so that our gameplay doesn't frustrate us every day.<br />
<br />
Also, I think Gladiator Warriors and bear/cat druids in the past were removed for a different reason entirely, game balance. I was still a noob back when Feral Combat was still a thing, but Gladiator Warriors were better than Arms and Fury at the start of the expansion, and had to gut it otherwise there was no reason to play anything other than Protection.<br />

People tend to overestimate the commitment to the game of the playerbase. You think &quot;I raid mythic, so most people in the game must do the same. I invest 60 hours a week on the game, so everyone does it.&quot;.<br />
<br />
Get your facts together. Most of the people are casuals. They play a couple of hours a week when their children, wife and job allows it and probably dont even know they can get an achievement that allows them to fly.<br />
<br />
If you want to get a measurement of the percentage of &quot;game educated&quot; people has gotten flying, check the polls in this post. 82ish percent of people can fly. 9ish percent cant fly but working on it. 9% are not working on it.<br />
<br />
So 9% of the educated player base are serious enough about not flying to not get the achievement.<br />
<br />

That's a pretty bland statement.<br />
There's also players who just casually got it while doing other things... like me for instance.<br />

Yeah, i have agreed with that as well. Mostly due to having played Ultima Online and that struggle to get to max something, or be at 700-720 skill points and wanting to redistribute. It really makes no sense to be able to get healing staff as a druid and then get artifact for feral.... it's too opposite to be &quot;that guy&quot; and to easily just flip. At least SWTOR has you pick an advanced path - so like a druid would be bear/cat or boom/tree. <br />
<br />
Of course, that shits on pure DPS classes - but as GC said, he went from unique to just a warlock. Takes the RPG out of MMORPG.</div></div><hr />

Except that Gladiator was a choice for the whole fight while Bear/Cat was a shapeshift in the middle of the fight. How you got insulted by Gladiator spec in a world where you can just freely change specs before combat? You could do the same as a Druid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh. Right. Shenanigans. That's something we really don't want to delve into.<br />
...<br />
Are you being serious right now?<br />
<br />
1. Despite the fact that Billzord Inc. implemented the fancy cross-realm system, the amount of people you meet on your daily 'dailies' run is drastically lower than it used to be back in, say, 2012. Credit where its due, I admit that cross-realming indeed compensates for 2014-2016 online drops, albeit somewhat poorly.<br />
2. Billzord Inc. made several crucial mistakes recently. They're still desperately trying to make a Frankenstein's monster out of slightly™ outdated game engine, a dozen concepts stolen from SWTOR and a few other derp-class MMOs and roughly one-third of the Diablo3 corpse. This does not bode well for the 'Best MMORPG of all times' WoW used to be.<br />
3. Speaking of Diablo3 misconceptions: I've gotten used to the matter that purple-colored loot is no longer as &quot;epic&quot; as it was. It was sad, it was infuriating, but I try not to think about it too much. However, one aspect of the game should've never ever been implemented: so-called &quot;warforged&quot; loot. When I'm finally looting my plate helmet off the Vaelastrasz, I want it to be exactly the same as the plate helmet McDerpington looted off him last week. I want that cursed Staff of Dominance to have exactly that much spell power, no more, no less. I want all my loot to be static. I don't want to be poked by a random &lt;IlliDown2004&gt; with a &quot;F U lucker and F U your 905 arcanocrystal&quot; and I sure as hell don't want to see a 920 socketed Arcanocrystal on a random 875 ilvl derp in a random heroic run. I. Do. Not. Want. This. Much. RNG. Loot drop chance, yes. Loot quality, NO.<br />
4. Roughly 66% of people I'm playing with or used to play with in World of Warcraft either feel the exactly same way as I do, or at least partially agree with me. Yes, some of my contacts actually loved the 'Korean Grind' part of the Legion. Some of them outright loved the Kadala 2.0 system. But they're a minority. Statistically, out of approximately 160 people I've interacted with, over a hundred players Did Not Approve of what happened to the game within the last five years. And out of that hundred, nearly forty-five quit the game since Pandacrap to never return. Hence the drastic decrease in the amount of players online.<br />
<br />
So let me try this again.<br />
Ah yes, &quot;Blizzard shenanigans&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I don't want to be poked by a random &lt;IlliDown2004&gt; with a &quot;F U lucker and F U your 905 arcanocrystal&quot; and I sure as hell don't want to see a 920 socketed Arcanocrystal on a random 875 ilvl derp in a random heroic run. I. Do. Not. Want. This. Much. RNG. Loot drop chance, yes. Loot quality, NO.<br />
4. Roughly 66% of people I'm playing with or used to play with in World of Warcraft either feel the exactly same way as I do, or at least partially agree with me. Yes, some of my contacts actually loved the 'Korean Grind' part of the Legion. Some of them outright loved the Kadala 2.0 system. But they're a minority. Statistically, out of approximately 160 people I've interacted with, over a hundred players Did Not Approve of what happened to the game within the last five years. And out of that hundred, nearly forty-five quit the game since Pandacrap to never return. Hence the drastic decrease in the amount of players online.<br />
<br />
So let me try this again.<br />
Ah yes, &quot;Blizzard shenanigans&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mists released 5 years ago. If you are still upset about the direction the game took 5 years ago, you might be better off just unsubbing and moving on. I really don't understand the warforged hate, either. &quot;Here is a piece of loot. It has these stats. Sometimes, at a random chance, you get a better one.&quot; It's just a random chance to get a little boost. This shouldn't upset anybody. And if you're mad when someone procs a higher level something than you have, really evaluate that feeling. Why? It doesn't affect you. Good for him, he got a little something something extra. He rolled a nat 20. Great!<br />
<br />
Also, I'm not sure what they picked up from SWTOR because when I played SWTOR it was a wow clone. I get that you think the glory days of WoW are gone; you're right. It's a 13 year old game. It's still the 'Best MMO of all times'. Nothing has touched the king. It's in a class all its own. I know it's fun to rage against Bli$$ard or whatever edgelord thing we're calling them now, but they made a genre defining behemoth that is the most widely played and most public example of its genre in existence. Nearly everyone has heard of WoW... and many many people have played it. Ask around the next time you are out in public. Ask complete strangers. Take an informal poll. See how many people have heard of World of Warcraft. In a separate column, see how many have heard of Wildstar. Or Elder Scrolls Online. Or Ultima Online. I'd love to see the results, but I have a pretty good guess.</div></div><hr />

Did that. Twice. I left WoW 1 week before the Sha of Fear was killed. Still got the Shek'zeer and Twins guild-RFs though. I was right about 110% Done with all that Pandacrap Billzord Inc. tried to feed me because some witless derp drew that witless derp-class cartoon of some witless derp pandas or something. That was SO disgusting I just couldn't force myself to stay.<br />
I tried to return to the game I once loved. Came back two weeks before the WoD release. Found myself a guild I used to play in BC and managed to start anew in a 6.0. Had to quit shortly after the Myth Mar'gok - while there were no panda derps around, the sheer amount of autism was intoxicating.<br />
And here I am once again. Hell if I know why. But at least I managed to force myself and reroll a Derp Hunter after seven years of mockery and humiliation playing as a Feral cat. Seven years. It flippin' took me seven years to do that.<br />
<br />

Here's a piece of loot. It's an instant /shard unless it procs +50 ilvl.<br />
Here's a piece of loot. It's a stat stick. See if we care.<br />
Here's a piece of loot. It's BiS. But don't be happy yet, we won't roll a single +5 on it and therefore it will be worse than abovementioned stat stick. Because screw you, that's why.<br />
Here's a piece of loot. It procced another +50. Yes, your beloved BiS item could've rolled that, but oh well. Go farm some resources.<br />
Here's a piece of loot.<br />
How will we mess it up today?<br />
Oh but that would be telling...<br />
<br />
And if you're mad when someone procs a higher level something than you have, really evaluate that feeling. Why? It doesn't affect you.<br />
Oh but it does. Some people may struggle gearing themselves up and they still will rarely ever proc a single decent warforge while the Derp Next Door logs in once per week, AFK-kills the Withered Jim and lewts a 920 trinket. This... must not be. This is wrong.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm not sure what they picked up from SWTOR because when I played SWTOR it was a wow clone.<br />
And it still is, a poorly designed and thoroughly infested by EA misconceptions. And back in my days SWTOR was desperately trying to steal more and more ideas and designs from WoW, not the vice versa. Yet here we are:<br />
- talent trees completely removed, nullifying whatever little build diversity we had<br />
- character progression reduced to linear ability unlocking<br />
- character gameplay reduced to Mashing Highlighted Buttons<br />
- ...three of them, tops. Unless you're a Cat. Then the mockery intensifies. Fun fact: SWTOR character gameplay is currently MORE complex than NINE WoW classes out of twelve.<br />
<br />
I get that you think the glory days of WoW are gone; you're right. It's a 13 year old game.<br />
Master of Orion 2 was released back in '96. It is still THE best and most interesting and complex TBS game ever existed. Stellaris ended up a great game simply because of one blunt reason: they tried to steal at least 50% of MoO2 game designs. And they SUCCEEDED at doing so. They went for the GOOD ideas, not just ANY ideas.<br />
<br />
It's still the 'Best MMO of all times'.<br />
True. Because MMO genre regressed to Korean Grinding and whatnot. Not because WoW itself is still so awesome.<br />
<br />
I know it's fun to rage against Bli$$ard or whatever edgelord thing we're calling them now, but they made a genre defining behemoth that is the most widely played and most public example of its genre in existence. Nearly everyone has heard of WoW... and many many people have played it.<br />
And we finally get to the root of all evil. You, sir, and the likes of you. The so-called fanboys.<br />
It's perfectly fine to be a fan. It is, however, not fine to be a fanboy.<br />
Whatever your beloved idol creates, you consume. You're trying to abolish any negative opinion referred to your idol. You and the likes of you are the reason MMO genre is in its current state. It's simple, really. Game devs were meant to receive both positive and negative feedback and consider all points of view. Yet you simply flood all forum topics, all discussions, all social networks with 'STOP DISLIKIN WAT I LIKE' and 'QUIT TEH GAME IF U NO LIKE' rubbish.<br />
<br />
You know what?<br />
You might want to have a looksee at a game called Skyforge. It was first released in CIS. It is an epitome, a pinnacle of regress, a paragon of wrong, a Failure Incarnate. And guess what? The moment you post ANY negative feedback on its forums (even if it is just a technical failure you're trying to report) you're instantly banned from posting and your feedback is expunged. And the game remains in its wretched state, because its devs care for nothing but monthly donations.<br />
Do you sincerely wish for the same fate for the game you probably used to love?<br />
Beware, 'fanboy'. The souls of games snuffed out and murdered by EA for the sake of Profit are condemned to languish for all eternity in oblivion. Their desperate screams are ringing in your ears. You just fail to hear them behind the fanfares.</div></div><hr />

Holy shit, I don't play this game anymore either but...<br />
<br />
Just quit, the game won't become what it once was. Many of the changes are for the better, even if I don't like them as much either.<br />
<br />
You're taking this game too serious. You're talking as if the world is about to end..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ontis</div><div class="date">2017-05-09, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Meanwhile, Bobby graces with yet another pinch of 'content'. Kill 100 demons. Loot 2k nethershards. Wait for the next update.<br />
This is exactly what I was talking about. This is one of the crappiest concepts Billzord Inc. stole from SWTOR: one day SWTOR devs came up with the great idea of releasing minor 'content' patches on monthly basis so that people would have no choice but keep paying monthly fee.</div></div><hr />
