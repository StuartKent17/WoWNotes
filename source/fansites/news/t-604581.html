If I understand this post correctly, it looks like addons authors will be able to add their own options submenu to the Interface options in 2.4.<br />
Interface Options Revamp<br />
<br />
Along with Patch 2.4 we will be releasing a revamped in-game Interface Options screen. Most of the systems that interact with the current Interface Options screen have seen some code changes as a result. The new architecture for the system should allow AddOn authors to modify its contents without the taint issues presented by the current Interface Options system.<br />
<br />
Additionally, this new system will contain an area for AddOn authors to present their own configuration options to players with a custom heading, subcategories, and frames. I'd like to encourage authors interested in utilizing these features to try the new system on the PTRs before Patch 2.4 is released. Basic details on how to use this system can be found in code comments in Blizzard_InterfaceUI.lua.<br />
<br />
Please be aware that AddOns that interact with the Interface Options screen, modify it, or change the way that its options affect other systems within the game will need to be updated with the release of Patch 2.4.<br />

Season 4 / 2.4 Patch - No ETA<br />
Well, we expected something for this week (according to a post from Nethaera a few days ago) but it's really starting to look like that we'll have to wait a little more. Let's try to stay positive and assume they're just building the suspense.<br />
We have made no announcement regarding season 4.<br />
<br />
There is more going into patch 2.4 than just the 25 person dungeon and I hope you get a chance to check it all out whenever it is available for testing.<br />
<br />
We know it's been a long time and we can't wait to discuss the new patch, but it isn't quite time yet, when time comes we will be happy to share it with all of you. <br />
<br />
<br />
European realms - Free character migration<br />
Another week, another batch of free migrations for european realms.<br />
Due to population differences between some of the highest and lowest populated PvP realms, the following Free Character Migration will be available January 30th to February 5th:<br />
<br />
From: Crushridge, Grim Batol, Outland, Stormscale<br />
To: Burning Steppes, Jaedenar, Vek'nilash<br />
<br />
Please note that the migration may be closed at any time should a destination realm's population rise too high.<br />

I should poke you in the eye for saying something that dumb.</div></div><hr />

You know when you press Escape in game and it brings up an options menu with stuff like:<br />
<br />
Video Options<br />
Sound Options<br />
Logout<br />
Exit Game<br />
<br />
and so on. It looks like they are putting code in place so that addons can be configured from this menu too somehow. The biggest advantage of this would be that it would no longer be nescessary for every addon under the sun to add its own in game button for configuring the addon which should help reduce the clutter in game with only addons who actually need to providing in game buttons.<br />
<br />
Assuming this is what they mean then the end result is less icons around your minimap just for configuring addons. For addon writers it probably will serve to make presenting such config screens to the user easier which should in theory result in them having more time to spend on useful stuff (though of course, for now they will have to spend lots of time rewriting their config screens so i guess its only a long term win :)</div></div><hr />

Standardization of add on configuration inside setup tab.<br />
If add on author use this (and they should), it will help players with 25 differents add on to manage them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You got it wrong. They mean the Interface Menu. Now you only have 2 tabs, Basic and Advanced Options, with 2.4 they will probably make so that addons are able to add new tabs or create a tab called addons and inside it configure all the addons.<br />
<br />
Not something really new but i hope addon creators will start to use this instead of keeping with rock/waterfall etc</div></div><hr />
