Patch 5.3 Dev Interview<br />
Today we are taking a look at an interview over on WoWInsider (http://wow.joystiq.com/2013/05/20/patch-5-3-and-more-with-ghostcrawler/) with Ghostcrawler.<br />
<br />
Future<br />
<br />
The unannounced feature is on schedule for patch 5.4.<br />
The new event in the Barrens is an experiment and another way to get players back out into the world, which we will see more of in Patch 5.4.<br />
Appearing offline on Battle.net is still in the works.<br />
Eventually all of the professions will have some sort of catch up mechanism. <br />
The game could use some sort of reward for leveling now that the new talent system doesn't provide a talent point as often. <br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
25 player raiding feels more epic than 10 player raiding, as well as allowing you to bring in friends or newer players without as big of an impact on the raid. <br />
25 player raids can fall back to a 10 player raid size if they begin to fall apart, while 10 player raids will just disband if they start losing people. <br />
Back during Molten Core there wasn't much going on in raids, making fights simpler and character optimization wasn't as big as it is now. Now fights have more mechanics to go with the new tools and more sophisticated players. <br />
LFR has to make some of the mechanics more forgiving, otherwise most groups would not be able to progress or the failures would fall onto the backs of the healers. Reducing player damage through debuffs from standing in the fire can be done to punish players, rather than applying damage to them and punishing the healers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
<br />
Raids have a longer lifespan than dungeons because you can only run them once per week. Dungeons can be run multiple times per day, so players get tired of them much faster. <br />
The team is growing to the point where in the future it may be possible to offer both a nice raid like Throne of Thunder and a dungeon or two in the same patch.<br />
Players generally expect new architecture, art, and mechanics in dungeons, which makes them much more time consuming to create than scenarios. <br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.3 Changes<br />
<br />
The XP requirement reduction in Patch 5.3 was done to make alt leveling faster, as it felt like it slowed down when you hit Jade Forest. <br />
Losing battlegrounds or arenas repeatedly to get gear so that you could be competitive in PvP wasn't fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
Adding caps to things like Valor Points or Charms is a challenge, because you have to strike a balance between stopping people from playing ridiculous amounts to earn them and other players that would never be able to compete. Players see a cap and feel that it is mandatory to reach it, even though that is not what was intended. WoW is a game, not a job, so players should not have to feel like they have to be constantly playing to stay competitive. <br />
Patch 5.3 isn't expected to increase subscriber levels very much, as that is generally what expansions and larger patches do. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
PvE Gear in PvP<br />
So yes, we do feel that PvP gear should be the best for PvP, but we don't mind some cross-over as long as it doesn't break the experience of the game. With some rather loose mathematics it has been shown in this thread how some tier 15/14 set bonuses can offer varying damage min/maxing options for PvP, however as Brian points out, that is not the only thing that you need for PvP. These differing options for gearing aren't really a bad thing as they offer additional gear options and play styles that are in no way a clearly better, or an upgrade for PvP. The reason that they are not clearly better or an upgrade is because of the bonus resilience/PvP power prvoided by them and also the reasons listed by Brian. <br />
<br />
Do understand though that we are listening to your feedback and keeping an eye out for any gear that we feel may need tweaking. If we find some PvE gear that is clearly outperforming PvP gear in instanced PvP, we will investigate it and take action if it's deemed necessary.<br />
<br />
40s less CD on Dark Soul vs 10% more Damage (that also comes with the T14) .... yeah, no competition between T14 and PvP Set bonus. <br />
You are ignoring the other bonuses that come from using the PvP set and just focusing on the &quot;Changes x skill in y way.&quot; descriptions. You also lose out on almost 7.5% passive damage increase through PvP power, which is pretty big and the Twilight Ward change from the 2-piece PvP gear is pretty powerful survivability bonus as well. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/261546-4-set-pve-bonus-pvp-bonus/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7526843061?page=6#114))<br />
<br />
Casting While Moving<br />
Its fun being part of that 10% not being able to cast while moving.<br />
I might be wrong here but I got the impression from last time I checked top rated teams, that there was a very high representation of shadow priests in 3v3. Even though this was before the nerf to Void Shift, so we’ll see how things go from here. <br />
What I meant to say is if SP representation was already high in s13 without them being able to run and cast at the same time, it would probably have been op if they could. Plus you have quite a few instant damage dealing abilities, shields, heals and CC. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/261515-running-and-casting/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7526883420?page=2#22))<br />
<br />
Heroic Scenario Loot<br />
The developers didn't want these items (Heroic Scenario item level 516 loot) to be best in slot. They would like to see them replaced by more powerful items (even if those items are of the same ilevel).<br />
<br />
Yeah it's quite silly that none of the scenario items have any sockets, Especially the helm. <br />
These items have random enchantments, and there are some technical limitations to have random stats plus sockets on them. The developers definitely agree that the helms might be particularly unattractive without a meta socket.

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Since no talent system overhaul, any word on LOWERING the amount of buttons next cycle? How about more glyphs in lieu of...?<br />
Would love to prune more buttons. It will cause many tears though if old favorites go away. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333012754745131009))<br />
<br />
Plans to fix feral gear scaling? We always start strong early expansion and tapered off. SR buff in 5.3 is a bandaid at best.<br />
We typically only worry about gear scaling if you tie at the start and then fall 5 to 10% behind at the end of a tier. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332549474515816449))<br />
It was a bigger problem say in BC where coefficients wouldn't get touched for many patches. These days we reevaluate every tier. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332549614001586179))<br />
<br />
Thoughts on tank swap mechanics? Nef/Morchok H was fun, taunting after every x debuffs on nearly every boss is not.<br />
Really tough to solve. Tanks told us they didn't like the cleave soaking (Lan'athel) either, yet not every fight is gonna have adds. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338371715019190273))<br />
<br />
Its not fully representative but, queue's seem to indicate the proportion of tanks/healers to dps isn't great.<br />
I think it is also more likely for tanks or healers to have groups of friends since they are designed to work as part of a group. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338364599260819456))<br />
By which I mean tanks and healers have less need for random matchmaking. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338364654239756288))<br />
<br />
The new talent design actually sucks. Dont know a single person that likes it personally.<br />
That surprises me. While it's not universal praise of course, the overwhelming majority of feedback is positive. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338013599324831744))<br />
<br />
Why so much focus on making every hybrid spec viable for PVP AND PVE, while not the same for pures? I dream of SV PVP/MM PVE!<br />
Every spec is the ideal, but we focus a lot on roles too. A mage probably minds changing spec less than a Shadow priest does. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336251916113813504))<br />

and there were other avenues available to tone down festerblight, such as tweaking Ebon Plaguebringer.<br />
The UM change wasn't for Festerblight. We think Tricks fixed that. It was because Unholy DPS was higher than we wanted it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337003837934141441))<br />
Or more specifically, the UM originally was for FB. Then we reverted it. Then we added it back for a different reason. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337003967148081152))<br />

Are you satisfied with the mobility hunters have since 5.1, or do you see either Fox or Sniper Training coming back?<br />
No immediate plans for either. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335559743806509057))<br />
<br />
How is Stampede NOT a flavor-fitting ability? I think hunters would rise up en-masse if Stampede disappeared.<br />
We added Stampede because, like Titan's Grip, players* asked for it for years. (* = Not every player of course.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333290399240159233))<br />
<br />
And Blink Strikes is already simming as a loss over Crows. You've already nerfed that tier into oblivion, please don't do more<br />
But in general we want passives to be lower DPS than actives since they ask much less of the player. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338369091767267328))<br />
<br />
For a spec like MM that's behind enough to be 'bad,' wasn't mastery created for tuning to turn 5% delta into something closer?<br />
The passives were created for that. If we buff mastery it can make you stack or avoid that stat depending on how we do it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337265809229479936))<br />

burst is out of control had a fire mage frostjaw to a cs to dead which is just wrong. From full to dead. This is not balanced.<br />
About 5 posts above someone says Fire is not longer viable. Can you guys work it out and report back to me? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338374040857243648))<br />
<br />
Greg, something is wrong with Evocation. 10% of the times the whole Evo still won't get the buff. Can you check it?<br />
Yes, there is something wrong with Evo not giving its buff consistently. It's not a simple fix but we are working on it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338012367701020672))<br />

Why are Holy Chakras not considered a stance?<br />
In what sense? With different action bars? We have discussed that implementation. Better / worse? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335790756038066177))<br />
<br />
spriests, I can see the void shift nerf fine. the mass dispel is just too much, cant you guys bake it in for shadow as well?<br />
The point was to nerf Shadow. Their damage, survivability and utility are all high. Hard for other specs to compete (PvP). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333293904612974593))<br />
<br />
Re: Disc Borrowed Time change: Nerfs are ok, but why remove a fun mechanic that allows good players to set themselves apart?<br />
If it was just a tough thing to do that rewarded skillful play, that would be fine, but it was like a secret trick you had to know. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338369602570575872))<br />
<br />
why was voidshift removed from PvP? Good spell with a very long cooldown. I don't see the issue considering some better ...<br />
It's not about the ability - it's the package. Shadow had great damage, survivability and utility in PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338365517641441280))<br />
<br />
I still don't understand how VE has a target cap at all. I thought it just converted DPS to HPS and split it amongst the raid<br />
If it had no target cap, the healing per player would be so small that you wouldn't notice it or so large that it would be OP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337264965234868224))<br />

shaman enh damage seems to be where it should be now on ptr. we still have a glyph problem. couple of em should be baked in.<br />
It's really hard with glyphs to hit that sweet spot between &quot;mandatory / should be baked in&quot; and &quot;don't care about.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335792552064200706))<br />

Warrior is the only class that cannot get below 1,5 sec global cooldown. It hurts a lot when you log back from alts<br />
Our main concern there is historically warriors are very sensitive to empty GCDs. At times you could even +HS off the GCD. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336644607909695488))<br />
Going to a 1 sec GCD for warriors might elicit feedback that their rotation is too slow and they need more abilities to use. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336644713673289728))<br />
Youre too concerned about too much rage. My hunter is drowning in Energy. Encourage rage pooling instead &amp; adjust dmg<br />
Rage pooling is cool. Treating the class as GCD limited and ignoring the resource completely is not. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336901043994648576))<br />

<br />
That is one of my favorite things about LOTRO that I would love to see in WoW. You can adjust for the number of players and by doing so change the difficulty -- ie set it to 5 players when you have 3.<br />
<br />
It would be easy to scale the amount of Valor/Justice/Gold you get this way, items might be a bit trickier.</div></div><hr />

Personally, unless it provided current-level (even LFR-level) rewards, I wouldn't bother. I go to old raids/dungeons hunting for transmog gear or achievements. This would be another &quot;something to do&quot; in a world where we really do got a bloody ton of content to do, even if you don't do dailies.<br />
<br />
Do you scale the players down, or scale the dungeon up? Scaling it up won't work really, given the ilevel jump from expansion to expansion, not to mention, fight mechanics of those old instances and raids are ridiculously simple compared to late-WotLK and up to current. Every MC/BWL/AQ40 boss had what... 1-2 mechanics going on, tops? Not to mention, if you scale it up, how do you justify dedicating the people that handle boss mechanics to that secondary task, when 5.4 also has an entire new raid to design, balance, and bug test too? Scaling players down, they might run it once, and never again if it isn't rewarding enough to warrant doing.<br />
<br />
This would be a &quot;in the future&quot; feature, not for 5.4. Maybe 6.0?</div></div><hr />

Well think about, 25 man raiding has 3 B-Rez's, 10 man raiding has 1 thats prbly were there going with this. Ya 25 man for sure feels more epic, but 10 isn't as forgiving as if 2 important people die its game over, but in 25 man 2 people die, get them up and you got 1 B-Rez left still. but thats doesn't say either one is more difficult than the other, it just says in certain situtations 1 of the raid sizes doesn't have to worry about that burden and its more forgiving during normal progression. Herioc Progression than its a whole different story.</div></div><hr />

Healers will just still end up having to heal more because the boss will just take longer to die. There is no fix for lazy or bad gameplay. We just have to suck it up and carry them.</div></div><hr />

Even on normal, there is a problem when all the boss areas can easily acomodate 10 players, but not 25, and you have mechanics where spreading out or not is what wipes the raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Their comment was about the impact of a single player in a 25man versus 10man. Simple math. 1 player in a 10man has 10% of the responsibility. 1 player in a 25man has 4% of the responsibility. They said *nothing* about the relative difficulty which varies from raid to raid and boss to boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I listened to the Gamebreaker.tv interview and what a bunch of PR upon PR. It was obvious that GBTV was just asking the questions that devs had put in front of them. I dared to say that - and was banned :D<br />
<br />
There are many good points in the interview that I have been pointing out for long. Example - lowering DPS when ppl stand in dmg instead of increasing the dmg ppl take. <br />
<br />
As far as 5 man content goes tho.. Blizzard failed this expansion and they can not hide from that. They are trying to admit it... but as a game developer you should have realised that well before and it should never have happened.<br />
<br />
As far as raids having longer lifespan... Just wrong. Totally and utterly wrong. Just because ppl do it once a week does not mean that they do it more often. And considering so many dungeons are being run while leveling - I can say with 100% confidence that the livespawn of dungeons is MUCH MUCH MUCH longer than any raid that becomes outdated almost the same day a new one is added - for ANYTHING but legendary and transmorg.<br />
<br />
But Blizzard needs to add new features to their 5 man content to give more variety. If making the dungeons is so hard... then give more random features to it so ppl do not feel they are always doing exactly the same thing. And considering what has been going on for AGES in other games... random maps could be added if they bothered. <br />
<br />
Considering that 5.4 is less than 4 month away (if they are really aiming for faster content) - they better start talking about it AND the new expansion ....... unless ofc they are once again let players wait for 8-12 months after last patch until expansion. Sadly that seems to be the case once more.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pacster</div><div class="date">2013-05-28, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*I might be wrong here but I got the impression from last time I checked top rated teams, that there was a very high representation of shadow priests in 3v3. Even though this was before the nerf to Void Shift, so we’ll see how things go from here.*<br />
<br />
Oh, so that's how we &quot;balance&quot; classes? We look at representation and if representation is high then that means they are op?<br />
Finally I get why blizz manages to fail time after time at balancing classes.<br />
Did it ever come to their mind that a dark priest ist just pretty cool and that 20 priority buttons are much more challenging/interesting than always hitting the same 4 button rotation as a mage? I mean if people would be into playing always the same mechanic, they'd play pve instead of pvp, right?<br />
And last but not least: May it be that shadows have been crap in pvp all the way since introduction of arenas and always did depend on imba cc of icemage or rogue(in the hands of really skilled players) to have ANY chance to be able to compete....and that players just wanted to play their old shadow again after it finally got on an equal level? How many really new shadows just levelled for arenas did we really see?<br />
<br />
<br />
*Plus you have quite a few instant damage dealing abilities, shields, heals and CC.*<br />
<br />
Did I miss out on any abilities? I mean, I play the shadow since classic...maybe I just don't know all spells yet. As far as I know we got exactly ONE instant spell that we can cast while moving(2 if you count that star or halo in...three if you add the pet. Both with cds and not doing much damage)...and that one does periodic damage(not exactly great for bursting). SW:Death needs to be glyphed and is bad, plague needs orbs for which you first need to stand still to get them, other instants first need to procc(so not around at all at start...and you need luck) and to even get the procc chance you need to cast VT(which is again an stand still spell). On top of that our only instant can be dispelled. <br />
<br />
Quite a few cc? Which ones? A mass fear for which you need to get to the target...it's not exactly instant if you run at your target at slow speed(most other classes run faster). I mean, hey, what do I do if I see a shadow running at me? Count one and one together. Every second class has an immunity ability against fear. <br />
Then we have horror...oh no..wait...for horror we first need an orb for which we have to cast mindblast(which is a loooong cast)...then we have a 1(!!!!!) second fear(which works even on distance, yay)...unless of course we need the orb for plague...ooops. Then we have silence(actually by far our best cc. But blizz is already discussing about taking blank silences out of the game...guess who will be hit first...useless against non-casters). <br />
And last but not least Psyfiend OR tendrils/roots. Roots need the enemy close by again, about every enemy has a break free mechanic, wasted against casters. It's that bad that about all players use the psyfiend. The psyfiend on the other hand is pretty crap too, you need to lay it down, it then has to cast(at a random target, good luck trying to use him for a cc-chain), is killed easily and people can just run out of range. Don't make me talk about mind control. <br />
2 shadows likely have a harder time to totally control one skilled target than ONE mage or rogue would....but hey, we got plenty instant cc. We do. Blizz said so. You just got to believe them.<br />
<br />
<br />
*The point was to nerf Shadow. Their damage, survivability and utility are all high. Hard for other specs to compete (PvP).*<br />
<br />
When, where, how? Their damage is only high if they survive the first 20seconds without of having to go full time healer. But seriously, whose damage isn't high if you just let them stand still and do whatever they please? The difference between shadows and other classes ist that most classes are already on that damage level in 5 seconds....which means that shadows have to heal to survive(which then means they don't have much damage anymore)...and on top of that shadows really have to use all their 20 buttons AND stand still to get to a damage level and support themselves in a way that other classes manage with 5 buttons while running after you.<br />
<br />
Granted, the shadow was worse in recent years than it is now, but that doesn't mean it is imba. <br />
Is there anybody even playing shadow at blizz? The pale dude in the corner whose name nobody knows and that never speaks up, maybe? ;-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think punishing people for standing in bad stuff is the solution, I think rewarding them for not is. If a player completes a full LFR encounter without taking damage from the the avoidable stuff, double their chance at loot or give them an extra bonus roll. Also, have a 'ready for raiding' achievement for each LFR boss and if you get em all you can have a fancy title. If you provide tangible rewards for better play, people will play better. The way LFR is right now, crap play is rewarded the same as good play. The player standing in everything stressing the healers or dying won't give a crap if they aren't doing good dps either.<br />
<br />
Also, nice to see a backtrack by GC on his ridiculous statement that players have to choose between good raids or more dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bonus roll is not a good idea, as it may cause some players to bail if they get hit by something. Now, loot that isn't too hard to obtain, but still useful like spirits of harmony would work. Another option is to require players that get hit by avoidable stuff too much to do a &quot;training&quot; solo instance to get loot. This way, the player has to spend more time if they aren't doing a good job. If AFKs are a big enough issue, then dps penalties for missing stuff might also help (as long as enrage timers are removed). The biggest issue is that it would require more coding to do so.<br />
<br />
My thoughts are that LFR should be a no-fail situation. The more people screw up the longer the fight takes. If you receive fatal damage then you get a debuff that reduces damage/healing done and damage received. Then you get put back at full. This effect would fall off eventually. The room would not be locked, and new people can join if any are missing part way though. Leave the chance to wipe the group to smaller group situations.</div></div><hr />

25 player raiding feels more epic than 10 player raiding, as well as allowing you to bring in friends or newer players without as big of an impact on the raid.<br />
25 player raids can fall back to a 10 player raid size if they begin to fall apart, while 10 player raids will just disband if they start losing people.<br />

You mean Warlock tanks do not need any extra gear to go from tanking to dps? Name me one tanking spec that can do top DPS in same gear as they do in their DPS role... And then you might realise the flaw. <br />

There are classes in the game now that need 3 totally different set of gear for their roles. That would be very unfair to them to see Warlocks stroll around with 1 item set... doing all the content.</div></div><hr />

I do this all the time when I heal and it works pretty good, after 1 or 2 deaths ppl learn not to stand in bad stuff. People who dont care about mechanics wont care or wont notice that their dps is low. They will notice that they are dead a lot and have huge repair bills.</div></div><hr />

If going tank warlocks would be gemming differently (sta), use different trinkets and probably have different stat priority. That's about as much gear set switching as other classes like priests, shaman, druids (both feral/guardian and boomkin/resto) and virtually all pure dps have.<br />
The biggest difference with hybrids is that warlocks don't have a second tier set to collect. But that's easily fixed by Bliz.<br />

No, but as you might already know, Blizzard ended up giving 65% base resilience to everybody regardless of the gear they are wearing. This change made the &quot;gearing up process&quot; in battlegrounds less forgiving, as you will no longer be instant killed by somebody who has the better gear.<br />
<br />
Well, you will most likely still die, as you wont have the PvP power to compete, but atleast you now have a chance to fight back, CC the oponen, run away, heal your self, call for help, or even learn from your mistakes ( in case you are just starting to learn a new class ), before you gout get killed.<br />
<br />
Piror to patch 5.3 you either had to buy all the crafted pvp gear and still be undergeared, or you had to play a ton of battlegrounds, where you basicly wouldn't be able to help your team much, and you would most likely die all the time, not because of lack of skill, but because of the lack of gear.<br />

Well learning your class is important but I accepted that when I didnt have gear I would die a lot, I feel losing is apart of learning and getting better. I have heard my friends complain when they lose a bg but when Blizz made it harder to kill a player that is not geared they made learning less likely.</div></div><hr />
