Actually, as an Alliance player, it doesn't bother me at all having to pay in-game gold for the mount. I just remind myself that I'm lucky Blizz even decided to add the Alliance mount. But still grats to the Horde players on their bike and getting it for free :)</div></div><hr />

What he meant was that he figured the Alliance Chopper would be in-game, but that he also figured they would probably sell it in the shop. He's pleasantly surprised that it's not the case, and admits that he's wrong. I think you should take your own advice. :P</div></div><hr />

&quot;Got thrashed&quot; as in Horde players clearing their caches so they could vote multiple times..<br />

What did you win? What kind of competition was it, where your only form of interaction/activity was voting, and the voting system was so unnecessarily, and heavily flawed that people could cheese it by just clearing their cache? ;)<br />

<br />
Commence the Horde QQ about how unfair it is, because they won something that was stupidly flawed anyway.<br />
<br />
it's just silly.  it isn't even about entitlement, but they caved because a bunch of people whined and complained.<br />

Well technically they are.. it's an exclusive design and it's free. The alliance one is a different design and costs gold.<br />

It is more people whining about how other people are whining, causing later people to think that there was whine to begin with. I think the general consensus is that this was predicted and probably a good compromise.</div></div><hr />

Well if any of those whiners actually watched Azeroth Choppers, one of their guys said he was getting a start on building the Alliance model. You KNOW they wouldn't allow that if there was any chance they'd just scrap it. Especially when they're pushing the Belf model revamp back.</div></div><hr />

No, the winner was supposed to get the bike in game and the loser wasn't.

Actually, it's grammatically correct. The &quot;it&quot; is in reference to the noun of the sentence, which would be the Horde Chopper.</div></div><hr />

All this was, was people clicking a button on the internet. No thought or skill involved, whatsoever. If this had actually been a measure of something in-game, like which faction can win the most arena matches or do the most dailies, then it should have been a winner-take all thing. It wasn't. Instead, it was a mindless publicity stunt and faction popularity contest, and all the talk of &quot;favoritism&quot; and &quot;entitlement&quot; on both sides is stupid.<br />

On the other hand, I guess it succeeded as a publicity stunt, people sure are talking about it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Screw off with this mentality, not everything is suppose to be 100% equal in game or in life. The Horde won and thus they get their mount free of charge, be happy that:<br />
1. The Alliance mount was made and will be available<br />
2. You can get it using in-game currency and not the cash shop.<br />
<br />
Entitled annoying internet sheep, just be happy that you can get it without having to spent any additional money on the game. <br />
<br />
To the people whether they are Alliance or Horde who think the mount is ugly and shouldn't have been added did you not see the amount of upset people who thought the Alliance wouldn't get a mount? If you think it is ugly fine, don't get it. A lot of others however think it is quite nice, personally I will get both bikes for my characters but not ride them because quite frankly there are better mounts but I am happy they added it for those who wanted it.</div></div><hr />

I'd like it priced at 1mil. Maybe it will stay something exclusive for about...1 month. As much as I would like it at an actual &quot;pretty hefty sum of gold&quot;, they probably make it 50k or something so everyone gets one. Happy day for gold farmers when this releases though.</div></div><hr />

I don't even like the look of the Alliance bike, not even a huge fan of the Horde one, but to have such an obvious disparity between one being free (and faction exclusive in game) and the other not seems like doing it just for the sake of manufactoring drama.<br />

Horde is &quot;awesome&quot; because of the way they are written not because of who or what they are. The fact that Blizzard chooses to write their best lore for the Horde is the only reason why any rational individual would consider them &quot;awesome&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It was pointless before it started. I'm pretty confident that 90% of the posters on this forum knew the Horde was going to win as soon as they announced it.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, I've been saying it since Day 1 that the winner would get it free and the loser would get it either in-game gold or cash shop. Honestly, they would not have had an episode in the series showing the teams going to one of the art devs for WoW to start working on making it if both weren't going into the game. With WoD being released, they don't have time to be wasting valuable man hours on something that MAY not be shown in game. So in other words, it was going in the game no matter what.<br />
<br />
And while I voted for the Alliance bike, I'm actually glad Horde won now. This bike looks very poorly made. The treads are bland looking, which I felt really stood out on the real bike. The blue frame and the chrome carapace rear piece look like they were painted on rather than looking authentic. If this is more than 50k gold, I won't be buying it. And even if I do, it will just be one of the endless mounts I never ride around on. To me, the Alliance one looked best IRL, but the horde one looks amazing in terms of in-game.</div></div><hr />

One chopper did reign supreme in the showdown. And the winner did take all of the showdown. But that still doesn't specifically say that the winner would be the only bike in the game.</div></div><hr />

People from both factions that act like they need everything the other one gets make this games story and logistics suck. Horde lost a character? Alliance has to lose on too. Alliance captured a zone? Horde needs one now. Horde wins a competition fair and square? Give the Alliance their prize anyways!<br />
<br />
The two factions should not even be close to equals; that makes everything boring and insignificant.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking the same thing. A decent sum of gold to take out of the system, and would put it in line with most of the rep mounts from MoP. I have a hard time seeing it being more expensive than the Yak, since it's just a single seater mount.</div></div><hr />

Did Chris Metzen build the motorcycles? Did he tell them exactly where to place every knut and bolt; every piece of plating?

Exactly, the Klaxxi mount was the first to pop into my mind actually, since it was 10k before any rep reduction I believe (8k at exalted?)</div></div><hr />

First of all, making it a popularity contest rigged the competition. Second, yeah, Metzen admittedly loves the Horde so why was he on the Alliance side?

While the writing for the contest was..vague to say the least, I always suspected both would be put in game, with the &quot;winning&quot; bike being put into the game earlier or have no cost to get it.<br />
<br />
What REALLY surprised me is that they aren't putting it in the store for $25, and instead will make it cost gold to purchase. From the pictures, it seems both are finished and ready to go into the game at any time.<br />
<br />
Now, one thing they didn't/haven't address (or I missed) was what happens to the distribution of the Horde bike, if you don't log in before the end of September or join WoW down the road. Will you not be able to get it, and be a time exclusive item? Will it go to the store? Will it cost gold like the Alliance bike?</div></div><hr />

not even for a second did I think that. they weren't going to put the time and effort into both bikes only to throw one away the only question was would it be a store mount? and gladly it's not because seeing the in game picture I actually quite like it (although not as good as the horde one ofc)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we're gonna go with the popularity contest argument, then the outcome is the same. It's no secret that the Horde is louder and more into the fistpumping thing than the Alliance. Metzen still had little to do with the competition. He gave them ideas and concept art from the game to give them a direction, same with the Horde team. I don't see why you want to push the &quot;rigged&quot; thing to this day. The competition is over, let it go. The annoying thing now is that we see the competition was practically for nothing. The Horde didn't win anything exclusive. Both sides won because one side has to cry when the other gets a new toy, and daddy blizz likes to spoil its kids.</div></div><hr />
