<br />
It’s important to note that once you outgrow content, by leveling past it by a predetermined amount, you’ll no longer gain points. The ‘outgrown’ level for end-game Wrath of the Lich King content is likely to be level 81. Once you level beyond Lich King content you’ll still be able to enter the dungeons, kill bosses, and see their drops, but they will not award you with points. This same principle applies to all content that provides Justice Points, including content from The Burning Crusade.</div></div><hr />

I know there were tokens datamined that were piece specific, I don't know if they're for getting tier pieces in the first place or for upgrading pieces that you've bought with points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can buy Tier with them - how else do you expect people to buy Frost gear after 4.0.1? My question, which I hadn't seen answered anywhere yet - what are the new Justice Point values for all current Frost and below gear??<br />
<br />
Btw, Tier 11 gear is bought with Valor Points (with the exception of a couple items). Check the links posted for details on those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think of it this way, Justice vs Valor is Triumph vs Frost. When a new tier comes out, you get a new badge. Now, when a new tier comes out, Valor points are converted to Justice points, and you start anew on Valor. From my understanding, Justice points are never reset, just accumulated. But with 4k hard cap, the Valor -&gt; Justice conversion should be a overwrite, not accumulative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4k. 4k is a *soft* cap in 4.0.1. In 4.0.3 it will be then be a *hard* cap. 4k. They are doing this so your won't lose any points on the badge conversion, and to allow you to quickly spend points to get below 4k before the hard cap is implemented (at 4k).</div></div><hr />

And also, if you end up having more than 4000 JP after they convert all the emblems, you will be unable to GAIN any additional justice points until you are below the soft cap again.</div></div><hr />

You buy tier items with points, with the exception of a couple items. Sorry to disappoint. Check the &quot;Valor Point Item Rewards&quot; link again. <br />

You can accumulate 4k. Yes. But you cannot buy 85 items until you're 85 (fyi, looks like a couple items -- I saw one -- are lvl 83).<br />
<br />
If Blizzard expects you to buy items at 80, to drop below a soft cap, then I want to know what those items are. There's no info on that! lol</div></div><hr />

Its looking like we will be able to use our JP at 85.<br />

Also not to mention the 4k cap will increase but only at 85, and the cost of items at 85 will be more than at 80. So you can get maybe 1-2 pieces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since you can't buy level 85 items till you're level 85, and since items cost between 1250-2200 Justice Points, this would be fairly pointless. You'd get, at most 2 blue items (Justice Points are for blue items, Valor Points buy epics and you can't get those until lvl 85 content). So yeah, if you want to slow down your progress to end game by turning off experience you can farm a ton of Wrath dungeons for two level 85 blue items that you could farm even faster at 85. Sure. You can do that.<br />

yeah. That has to do with the English language my friend. Look at the picture. Look at what they are talking about. Most items cost points. A couple items cost a token.

How is that fail? It's what is currently done now. You get 2 Frost Badges for doing a LK daily Heroic and you get 75 VALOR Points for doing a Cata daily Heroic. It's only 75 points a day which is nothing just as 2 Frost badges a day is nothing.</div></div><hr />

I don't see why people complain about the daily random awarding some valor. If you look at the cost of things it will take them weeks to get a single item while people that raid will have everything they want months before.

<br />
What you're missing to see here though, is that Tier 11 will be set back to Justice points when the new Tier comes out. So its not so much the issue of receiving Valor points with which you can buy the Tier 11, it will just become the Justice set the Tier after that anyway. Just like it started with WotLK.<br />
<br />
-&gt; Downraking the Old Tier &lt;- Is what makes Epics so easily attainable.. the Valors per Daily mean absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
We're talking 75 a day.. items cost +- 1650 valor: that means 1650/75= 22 dailies for 1 tier 11 Item. I don't see the issue really. Lets do some math: 5 items = 5x 22 = 110 days, which equals to approximately 16 weeks. Or even 4 months.. to get 5 Tier 11 items. Again.. I ask, what is the problem? I'm talking 4 months, of doing a daily -each single day- just for 5 items. I fail to see where that is not dedication. Holy christ I'm glad that I can raid and just get one or two items a week and have the set within half a month. Honestly, if someone doesn't have the means to raid, but does have the dedication to spend those 110 days they have my blessing.<br />
<br />
You're really making a fuss about nothing, the issue with easy epics arrives only the second that the new Tier arrives.</div></div><hr />

However seems it will be impossible to go back and get old tier since you'll not gain JP above 80 which seems kinda strange to me, why couldn't they just have introduced a 3rd type of points for old content, that way the new points values wouldn't have to be so high as well, oh well.<br />

Also yes you'll be able to get 2 pieces of blue level 85 gear with JP from lvl 80 content but really big deal, will just help you gear up for heroics a bit faster.</div></div><hr />

Or someone that simply doesn't care about raiding have gear that they don't need for heroics?<br />

If you raid, you get a shot at raiding gear (because you need that to down raid bosses you know?), if you don't raid, why would you want/need it for 5man?<br />

<br />
You confused me here. Where does it say you won't get JP past 80? Normal Cataclysm dungeons will award you JP. WRATH dungeons and heroics will no longer award points past (at? or past?) 81. That's what GC is saying. This prevents people, lvl 83 or so, from doing 5 min Wrath heroics just for JP. Or running a quick 30 min ICC just for JP. It's to make you run Cataclysm points for your justice points. <br />
<br />
Upon earning enough JP, you can very much go back and buy old Tier armor with those points.</div></div><hr />

It would take people a month to buy a single piece, which seems ok investement/return rewards. Even though they are making it easier than it is currently. <br />
2200 VP / 75 VP per day = 30 days (rounded up)<br />
95 EoF / 2 EoF per day = 48 days (rounded up)<br />
<br />
The problem I have are mostly with what currently is the weekly raid, Vault of Archavon and the simplicity of the early raid bosses in a lot of raid instances. Now hopefully cata will change the latter But we're still unsure about the other 2. Hopefully the decrease in days per tier through heroics, means that they scrap a few of the other VP gains.<br />
<br />
Note: I'm not against an easy way to step into raids; I'm against even terribad pugs clearing half the highest tier content. I can hardly even count on fingers anymore how often I've been the only one, or one of half a dozen people actually dpsing spikes on marrowgar while the rest just zergs the boss. Or people ignoring the transformed fanatics on deathwhisper, because it took too long for them to spawn so i was already dpsing the boss, people ignoring adds on saurfang because &quot;i already killed one&quot;. This stuff is too stupid for words, people can ignore vital game mechanics get away with it and get better loot than someone who does 10 man heroic.<br />
<br />
I mean if you currently add it. You need 95 badges for chest/head/legs. You can get 14 per week from the daily heroic, another 5 from the weekly raid, another 4 from super easy VoA bosses. That's already 23 badges per week. That means it would not take me 30 days but 29 days (remarkable coincidence almost the same as you can get in heroics in cata). <br />
What i find even worse is highest level tier dropping from the VoA bosses. It's just painful to see my hard work in doing 10 man heroic ICC be devalued because random scrub #72944 got a lucky roll in VoA25.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably because if all you can farm is heroic dungeons, and you don't raid, why do you need raid gear?<br />
<br />
Raids should give points for raiding gear, heroics should not give points for raiding gear. Heroics don't require raiding gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not exactly. It's to stop people from getting so far behind, they're unable to catch up IF they decided to raid. Think of it this way; somebody comes in now and wants to raid ICC. They just finished heroics. How are they going to catch up to be ICC ready? They sure enough can't go through Naxx -&gt; Ulduar -&gt; ToC then ICC like the rest of us raiders did.<br />
<br />
It's a method to allow everybody, raider and non-alike, to get to the same playing field. This is what Blizzard wants. Casuals be *able* to gain that level, even if they don't raid. To put it another way, Blizzard does not want to lock out anybody from obtaining Tier # gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See the difference from JUSTICE points (Heroic Bosses, normal daily dungeon etc) and VALOUR points (Raid Bosses, heroic daily dungeon).<br />
<br />
It is more or less the same mechanic they use right now on live. I only miss the mention of the weekly raid quest.<br />
<br />
And i want to refresh your memory concerning the announced weekly cap for Valour Points which will lead into raiders hitting the cap eventually when the second tier of raids will be introduced and which will relieve them of the &quot;must-do&quot;-feeling of the daily heroic at least.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vasti</div><div class="date">2010-10-06, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So 1 emblem of Triumph/Frost gives us 11.58 JP.<br />
So farming heroics now gives us in lets say, heroic Nexus, if its daily hc even:<br />
2 frosties (daily hc)<br />
5 triumphs (5 bosses)<br />
==========+<br />
7*11.58 = 81.06 Justice points<br />
<br />
Now after patch 4.01<br />
We get:<br />
16*5 (16 per boss)<br />
23 (daily hc)<br />
=====+<br />
103 Justice Points<br />
<br />
(same can be applied to any place where bosses drop triumph emblems)<br />
<br />
For ICC and probably Ruby Sanctum raids however we get on live:<br />
(Assuming a full clear withouth doing the weekly, as its unsure what the weekly icc Q will provide)<br />
(for ease lets leave out valkyr boss, since we dont know how much JP she will give)<br />
12 bosses that drop 2 frosties = 24 frosties<br />
So 24* 11.58 = 277,92 Justice Points<br />
<br />
And now after 4.01<br />
12 bosses at 23JP each = 12*23 = 276 Justice Points<br />
<br />
<br />
SO CONCLUSION:<br />
<br />
Farming heroics for justice points on live is time wasted since after 4.01 the same amount of heroicsfarming will give you more Justice Points.<br />
<br />
Farming ICC and RS will prolly be time-well spent. Since you get more JP per boss kill on Live (given the current conversion rate) then after patch 4.01<br />
<br />
TLDR: Go do ICC10/25 and RS10/25, VoA10/25 will prolly also be a good investment. Farming heroics for Justice points is bad, untill 4.01 arrives.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a method to allow everybody, raider and non-alike, to get to the same playing field. This is what Blizzard wants. Casuals be *able* to gain that level, even if they don't raid. To put it another way, Blizzard does not want to lock out anybody from obtaining Tier # gear.<br />
<br />
There's no problem with this if you can BUY ITEMS FROM THE PREVIOUS TIER. I have no problem with being able to get points for Tier 11 if people are in Tier 12 content, but people should not be getting the same raid level gear as people who are actually raiding 10 and 25 man raids for doing 5 man dungeons, that's rediculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It might sound weird, but the conversion rate is now at a ratio where the costs equal out. If you have a combined sum of 190 emblems of Frost AND Triumph when the conversion hits us with 4.0.1, then you will have enough JP to buy 2 pieces of T10 which would cost you a sum of 190 Frost-Emblems right now (so head/chest/legs-type pieces). I think a T10 helmet will cost 1100 JP (it does on the PTR at least)</div></div><hr />

So its not so much the issue of receiving Valor points with which you can buy the Tier 11, it will just become the Justice set the Tier after that anyway. Just like it started with WotLK.<br />
<br />
-&gt; Downraking the Old Tier &lt;- Is what makes Epics so easily attainable.. the Valors per Daily mean absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
We're talking 75 a day.. items cost +- 1650 valor: that means 1650/75= 22 dailies for 1 tier 11 Item. I don't see the issue really. Lets do some math: 5 items = 5x 22 = 110 days, which equals to approximately 16 weeks. Or even 4 months.. to get 5 Tier 11 items. Again.. I ask, what is the problem? I'm talking 4 months, of doing a daily -each single day- just for 5 items. I fail to see where that is not dedication. Holy christ I'm glad that I can raid and just get one or two items a week and have the set within half a month. Honestly, if someone doesn't have the means to raid, but does have the dedication to spend those 110 days they have my blessing.<br />
<br />
You're really making a fuss about nothing, the issue with easy epics arrives only the second that the new Tier arrives.<br />
<br />
+ next voa with points and the tier drop + raid weekly... and all that to support ppl that don't raid to get raid gear so they get bored even faster with their outgeared 5man dailies? Weird.<br />
<br />
That's why they forced ppl to raid by making raiding easy. Really sad to pay for a game to only do 5mans after you get to the max level.<br />
<br />
If you don't pvp, why do you need pvp gear (not to mention high rating/current season gear)?<br />
If you don't raid, why do you need raid gear (again, the same deal with heroic gear)?<br />
<br />
You can't place ppl who don't raid/pvp with the ppl who came later/stop playing and need a little boost to catch up with the current raiding/pvp scenario. That's what this system does.</div></div><hr />

Sorry dude I work 60 hours a week and am currently enrolled in classes and still manage to find time to play video games and raids, that excuse is old. If you can only play 30 minutes a day, you don't deserve the same gear as someone who raids a couple hours a week.

no offense but, are you retarded ? why on earth would you even bother gearing up now ? its a waste of time just keep the points so that you can buy ear at 85 with them.</div></div><hr />

Farming heroics for justice points on live is time wasted since after 4.01 the same amount of heroicsfarming will give you more Justice Points.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, but i have 9 level 80 toons. I won't get them all capped as i think the JPs will be more important to have on the toons that will reach 85 pretty fast so they can hold their own with the group that is full of &quot;fresh&quot; 85s... Later on as people get more gear it is easier to beat the heroic content even if you don't reach 85 with a 4k JP cushion (and you might already have more means to get crafted gear too).<br />
<br />
So i just pick my pace at the moment and do a few a day for fun.</div></div><hr />

What we're saying is that it will take them about a month of daily farming -each day- to get 1 item. <br />
<br />
We're talking 1 epic Current Tiered item per month.<br />
<br />
When you're in the next tier.. then only will they have a quick access to your previous tier. Which makes perfect sense for people that want to catch up to raiding and join a guild. As the previous content is also what you're raiding in. But again, you have access to the next tier, and they don't.<br />
<br />
Personal raiding experience is that I get about 3 items a week.<br />
Valor token saving will get you 1 a month.<br />

Raids should give points for raiding gear, heroics should not give points for raiding gear. Heroics don't require raiding gear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reason not the need&quot;<br />
<br />
Who cares what people need, what they want is a way of advancing their character, doing more dps/hps/tps. The only way they can do that assuming they are pretty proficient is better gear.<br />

The whole point of an RPG is to advance your character, if their are people who can't raid for whatever reason you want to tell them that it's game over at level 85.<br />

Where does it say you won't get JP past 80? Normal Cataclysm dungeons will award you JP. WRATH dungeons and heroics will no longer award points past (at? or past?) 81. That's what GC is saying. This prevents people, lvl 83 or so, from doing 5 min Wrath heroics just for JP. Or running a quick 30 min ICC just for JP. It's to make you run Cataclysm points for your justice points. <br />
<br />
Upon earning enough JP, you can very much go back and buy old Tier armor with those points.<br />

<br />
As a personal experience from Alts:<br />
<br />
Heroics Gearscore and DPS. I've been kicked from heroics for having a too low Gearscore, or because my DPS was so low compared to the fully raidgeared DPS that they said I was slowing the group down.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying I perfectly know how to play that alt class, Its exactly that, an Alt..<br />
<br />
I agree that you technically don't need raidgear if you don't need raids. But you'll never be able to compete and join a guild in your Heroics gear either that way..<br />
<br />
Say for instance there is a new guild starting up in Cata.<br />
<br />
They have all people in fresh gear.. then they tier up twice. Bringing them to tier 12.<br />
<br />
Now I rejoin WoW after a 1 year break. And I try to join that guild.<br />
What can I bring of value to that guild apart from my sunshine attitude? I'd say not much. And it'll take them a shitload of patience to drag me along and gear me up.<br />
<br />
Or am I missing how this would be done otherwise?<br />
I joined WoW when Naxx was released. I got a full dungeon set 2, and tried to join.. but no guild would let me in due to my gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By doing the new dungeon/heroics that usually have gear of the same ilvl of the previous raid? By increasing the number of drops of previous raids, so you're ready faster than &quot;an entire patch later&quot;? By finally throwing the former tier into the points system instead of the current one?<br />
<br />
Players that doesn't care about raiding would get their new toys and their new content/challenge and at the same time the ppl who need to catch up can do it. Seems more fair than just giving current tier to everyone from everything. You don't get player's interest by giving everything anymore than showing a path that he can follow into the game/story...<br />
<br />
Just imagine (forget about the current ilvl diferences between raid sizes) that normal ICC5 would give you 232 gear and heroic ICC5 would give you 245 with the end boss giving you a few 251 pieces (and both dungeons are challenging, like cata dungeons seems to be again). You don't raid and you're not sad that you're still sporting your old 200/226 gear from previous heroics in 3.3.<br />
<br />
You do raid, but you missed 3.2 or even 3.1 patch. You can go to ToC, mix what you get there (including T9 bonuses wich should be on par or a little better than just equipping non-set 232/245/251 gear) with what you get from the new ICC5/Heroic ICC5 dungeons and you're set to start ICC raiding without the need to give 264 gear from heroics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because everyone needs a goal of some sort. Once one goalpost has been met, there should be another one beyond that one, and another, and another. One of the old problems with heroics and heroic-only players is that they would meet a goalpost (getting all the heroic-level gear available) and then... nothing. They'd just be stuck there, at that level, their bags/character slots filling with Badges of Justice and Emblems of Heroism with absolutely nothing to spend them on and no incentive to keep running heroics (incentive in the sense of a goal to work towards). Then WOTLK kicked it into high gear, and heroic-only players had tons of goals to work towards. They could get that tier piece! They could buy a new ring! To be honest, the gear itself is secondary; what matters is the feeling of having something to work towards, to improve yourself with. THAT is something that NEEDS to be part of any heroic system.<br />
<br />
Now, does it absolutely have to be tier gear and raid-quality items? Not necessarily. I think it could also work with expensive profession mats (thus making heroic-only runners a serious presence in server economy), or pets and titles, or something else fun. But the fact is that you must give heroic players something to try for once they've finished their gearing.<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, what would YOU introduce to the game to give heroic players a moveable goalpost and something to work towards on a constant level?</div></div><hr />

They do this so people coming new to the game can get caught up to current raid levels and so players like me who have 8 80's can gear out more than 1 toon and allow me to switch my main if I get bored. You clearly only play one class and are narrow minded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I simply don't see why it matters what someone else has. Yes, I raid. Yes, my main is decked in all 264 and 277 gear. It really doesn't bother me that someone who doesn't raid gets some 251 and 264 pieces. Why should it? What are they taking away from me? If anything it's nice that I can gear up my alts so that if I need to sub in as a healer or tank I'm actually somewhat geared for the job. It means that when we recruit someone they can (assuming they're not an idiot) start contributing right away instead of having to be carried to gear ups. <br />
<br />
It takes a *long* time to farm even a single current tier piece from heroics. By contrast raiders get enough points to buy a piece or more a week, plus drops. It really affects you not at all in any case. You're still getting your gear and getting it much faster.

I laugh at this. I raid and plan on multiple tanks in cat. I want a 25 man and a 10 man toon. So I am a serious raider. I could care less if someone who never steps in a raid gets last tier or after a month gets one whole piece of current tier. <br />
<br />
I have said before and will say it again, serious raiders care about THEIR progression. <br />
<br />
Progression is about progression not standing in IF or Org saying look at me. <br />

The day a boss I kill drops less loot so someone who doesn't raid gets some I will get mad, but until then I could care less</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karot</div><div class="date">2010-10-06, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to be a lot of uncertainty and misinformation in this thread already...<br />
<br />
1) You will be able to buy tier, with a combination of VALOR points (the high end points) plus the tier token. I'm assuming when a new raid tier is released, this cost will apply to the new tier, and the older ones will revert to costing just JUSTICE points (the points from heroics). They will probably also require the token, or they might not.<br />
2) The system likely applies to BC content as well. I'm guessing what's purchasable now with Badges of Justice will probably cost Justice points, which you'll be able to earn from BC heroic and raid content at level 70. From 71-79 you will likely only be able to continue earning them from the daily WotLK normal dungeon, and then at 80 can continue earning them as it says in the blue post above.<br />
3) You will probably still be able to buy older tier with your points, if you so choose.<br />
4) WotLK heroics will award the same points as WotLK raids. In Cataclysm, you will earn Valor points ONLY from the 10 and 25 player raids, plus the DAILY heroic (yes, that's once per day). Everything else awards Justice points.<br />
5) Yes, any items that are purchasable with any emblem from WotLK (heroism, valor, conquest, triumph, and frost) will instead cost justice points.<br />
6) Yes, it certainly looks like you could turn off experience gain at 70 or 80 to farm points. I'm sure Blizzard wouldn't want to remove the ability for BC or WotLK &quot;twink raids&quot; to be able to accumulate points and get gear. And when you turn off experience gain, you turn off experience gain. It's not just for BGs, it's for everything.<br />
7) They are not going to reset the points for Cataclysm. It was stated in a blue post that they were not going to prevent players from saving up some points if that's what they want to do. Personally, I'll first obtain the best gear I can from WotLK (for early leveling in the expansion), then get to the points cap to save so I can buy a few 85 blues.<br />
8) Tip if you're curious how much WotLK gear will cost in points: Find the currency calculator here on MMO-Champion (it's a few news posts down) and input how much the item costs in emblems. The conversion rate is going to be pretty close, if not exact, to what the item will cost in Justice Points.<br />
9) From 81-84 the only way you'll be able to continue to farm JP as you level will be from the daily &quot;normal&quot; dungeon. That's once per day.</div></div><hr />

They can easily make gear sets and other items lower level than raid gear that you can get for doing heroics, but just simply giving raid gear for people who aren't raiding is silly.<br />
<br />
They're not giving it away darling.. they're giving you a possibility to earn 1 item of current raidgear per month.<br />
Which requires the person to do 1 daily Heroic -each day- for the duration of that month.<br />
<br />
The Justice marks, are what you can buy the previous Tier with. Which is your old trash basically.</div></div><hr />

So its not so much the issue of receiving Valor points with which you can buy the Tier 11, it will just become the Justice set the Tier after that anyway. Just like it started with WotLK.<br />
<br />
-&gt; Downraking the Old Tier &lt;- Is what makes Epics so easily attainable.. the Valors per Daily mean absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
We're talking 75 a day.. items cost +- 1650 valor: that means 1650/75= 22 dailies for 1 tier 11 Item. I don't see the issue really. Lets do some math: 5 items = 5x 22 = 110 days, which equals to approximately 16 weeks. Or even 4 months.. to get 5 Tier 11 items. Again.. I ask, what is the problem? I'm talking 4 months, of doing a daily -each single day- just for 5 items. I fail to see where that is not dedication. Holy christ I'm glad that I can raid and just get one or two items a week and have the set within half a month. Honestly, if someone doesn't have the means to raid, but does have the dedication to spend those 110 days they have my blessing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You're really making a fuss about nothing, the issue with easy epics arrives only the second that the new Tier arrives.<br />
<br />
Right. But why should anyone be worried about who gets previous Tier epics? Epic doesn't really mean anything unless it's from the current top Tier, and in this context &quot;current&quot; is an ever-shifting target.<br />
<br />
They've said that each new Tier release will now correspond with a Valor&gt;Justice dump, so the &quot;scrubs&quot; who are not raiding will have to farm heroics for months all over again to get anything from the newest Tier, while raiders will start picking up the new Tier items almost right away.<br />
<br />
It would be a lot rougher if each new Tier also brought a Justice&gt;Gold dump, which would reset the baseline, so to speak. I doubt Blizz will do this, however, since it's just too harsh on casual players.<br />
<br />
The only other alternative would be to downgrade all previous Tier epics to blue once the next Tier releases. That won't happen because it would be too harsh on everyone.</div></div><hr />

Chances are, someone that makes $25k/yr probably CAN'T afford the Porsche and will not buy it because it is out of their means. Exactly how people who only do heroics don't NEED raid gear, because they don't have the means to raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand they wanted to make the feature popular in Lich king, but we've all seen it, we like it to some extent, we're still going to use it when we need to, stop giving the best rewards for a feature which so easily becomes menial and aggravating. This feature is one of the main reasons epic items are so easily acquired now. Change it, please.<br />
<br />
I hope they don't. The people that only run the daily random heroic each day will get their gear at a much, much slower pace than those that raid. And the heroics are not going to be AoE 15-20 minute grindfests where the only word said is &quot;gogogogo&quot;. If it's become menial and aggravating, then you don't have to do it. This is a game, after all. The point is to have fun. Epic items are so easily acquired now because any heroic can be AoE'd down in 20 minutes. Not to mention that ICC, frost emblems, and the dungeon finder tool have been out for about 10 months now. Sorry, but your complaint really isn't justified unless you're saying that ICC raid heroic gear is too easily acquired now. It's still a challenge and most players won't get any of that stuff.</div></div><hr />

In that case, what would you suggest Blizzard give heroic players to work towards after they've bought everything their Justice Points can buy (in the current tier)? What many people don't realize is that it's not about LULZ HEROIC PLAYERS NEEDZ RAIDING GEAR LULZ but more, &quot;I want to improve my character and have a goal to work towards.&quot; Speaking as someone who used to do only heroics and Kara/ZA in BC, after a while I ran out of things to do or buy with my Badges of Justice, and it sucked... not because I wanted super duper gear, but because I no longer had something to drive me, a target to work for.<br />
<br />
So, for those that are arguing that heroic players shouldn't get raiding gear, what would you give them instead that they can continually work towards even after they've geared up in heroic gear?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that they will become exactly the &quot;gogogo&quot; shit that they are now if they keep this system. Raiders who dramatically outgear them will keep doing them when they're outgeared and will be just as abusive as they are now to people who slow them down.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2010-10-06, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a personal experience from Alts:<br />
<br />
Heroics Gearscore and DPS. I've been kicked from heroics for having a too low Gearscore, or because my DPS was so low compared to the fully raidgeared DPS that they said I was slowing the group down.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying I perfectly know how to play that alt class, Its exactly that, an Alt..<br />
<br />
I agree that you technically don't need raidgear if you don't need raids. But you'll never be able to compete and join a guild in your Heroics gear either that way..<br />
<br />
Say for instance there is a new guild starting up in Cata.<br />
<br />
They have all people in fresh gear.. then they tier up twice. Bringing them to tier 12.<br />
<br />
Now I rejoin WoW after a 1 year break. And I try to join that guild.<br />
What can I bring of value to that guild apart from my sunshine attitude? I'd say not much. And it'll take them a shitload of patience to drag me along and gear me up.<br />
<br />
Or am I missing how this would be done otherwise?<br />
I joined WoW when Naxx was released. I got a full dungeon set 2, and tried to join.. but no guild would let me in due to my gear.<br />
<br />
Don't know, back in TBC (so, not that far), guilds would test you and know that you performed well for the gear you have at the moment. If you couldn't perform well with the gear you have, they would basically know that it doesn't matter if they brought you to upgrade it... you would still perform sub-par.<br />
<br />
By doing what Blizzard did in WotLK, they created the gearscore monster. Most guilds/players don't have a clue how to distinguish a good player from a bad player anymore if they're not sporting the current high ilvl gear. They tell you not to improve your game, but instead your GS number... You have ppl that simply think that 5000GS was the Ulduar 25 or ToC10 normal GS...<br />
<br />
You need to stop that start from somewhere... the best place would be this insanity of free current gear.</div></div><hr />

To explain it VERY clearly for everyone that just can't seem to read and/or grasp the concept:<br />
<br />
Justice Points and Valor Points are the SAME as Triumph Badges and Frost Badges!!!<br />

You will still be able to buy old tier just like you can today.<br />

Example:<br />
Time Frame: First set of Raiding Instances (I.e. Naxx for WotLK)<br />
Heroics will award you Justice Points (with VP from the Daily Heroic)<br />
First Raid instance will get you Valor Point.<br />
You can buy: Blues with JP, and Tier 11 with VP.<br />
<br />
Time Frame: Second set of Raiding Instances (I.e. Ulduar)<br />
Heroics will award JP (with VP from the Daily)<br />
First Raid instance will award JP<br />
Second Raid instance will award VP<br />
You can buy: Blues and Tier 11 with JP, Tier 12 with VP<br />
<br />
Time Frame: Third set of Raiding Instances (I.e. ToC)<br />
Heroics will award JP (with VP from the Daily)<br />
First &amp; Second Raid instance will award JP<br />
Third Raid instance will award VP<br />
You can buy: Blues, Tier 11, and Tier 12 with JP, Tier 13 with VP<br />

<br />
I agree with you, but I guess its the same mentality as moaning about a drop in boss HP of the previous tier when the next Tier is released. Blizzard wants everyone to see their content, and offers the Hardcore teams a good challenge.<br />
<br />
But some people just can't handle it when their achievement is then attainable by &quot;anyone&quot; which is also a reason I would fully support removing the attainability of cosmetic rewards once the raid is tuned down.<br />
<br />
By cosmetic I mean Mounts/Titles etc, items that do nothing special for your character development wise. (and no.. 310% mounts also don't count to me.)<br />
<br />
The downgrading Epic to Rare is just game mechanics I guess. And we'll all be walking around in Epics when the next tier after T11 is released. Nothing can really be done about that I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have said before and will say it again, serious raiders care about THEIR progression. <br />

Progression is about progression not standing in IF or Org saying look at me. <br />

The day a boss I kill drops less loot so someone who doesn't raid gets some I will get mad, but until then I could care less<br />

Exactly. People who bitch about other people getting the items they have are generally just barely above the level of the so-called &quot;scrubs&quot; they look down upon. Hell, a year ago they probably WERE at the level of the people they so despise now, which is even more pathetic.<br />

New challenging heroics with a higher lvl gear than the current heroic ones?<br />
<br />
Think of heroics the same way you think of raids. What do you give to raiders that alread cleared the content and got their gear? New raids.<br />
<br />
What do you give to heroic players that did the same? New heroics.<br />
<br />
They're progressions paths. Just diferent in size and complexity. Heroics even have achievements for doing weird stuff like raids and you get a mount for finishing its &quot;Glory of&quot; meta!</div></div><hr />

<br />
However seems it will be impossible to go back and get old tier since you'll not gain JP above 80 which seems kinda strange to me, why couldn't they just have introduced a 3rd type of points for old content, that way the new points values wouldn't have to be so high as well, oh well.<br />
<br />
Also yes you'll be able to get 2 pieces of blue level 85 gear with JP from lvl 80 content but really big deal, will just help you gear up for heroics a bit faster.<br />
<br />
you get JP for killing 85 heroic bosses and doing the daily dungeon</div></div><hr />

As long as you also need the Slotted tier token from raiding the current level of progression to get your tier, I'm happy. You should have to raid to get tier. Not farm heroics each day for Frosties or Valor Points.</div></div><hr />

Yup. The &quot;really good&quot; raiders don't need the best or unique loot to prove they're far and above better than the rest. Though, they wouldn't object to having unique loot/titles/mounts, etc. ;)<br />
<br />
If you're &quot;good&quot; enough or have enough time, you're still going to gear out and have a different gaming experience than the guy who can get one tier piece every 2-3 weeks. Believe me, in many cases, that guy wishes he had the time/skill to do what you're doing.</div></div><hr />

Well you won't be happy then as you will be able to get some tier from running heroics, at a vastly slower rate than a raider will.<br />

For me my preference is 10 becasue there's too many times Ive been in a 25 man where people fuck shit up too much, also progression is faster in 10 man always. Basically the server I mm on is all retards and it hasn't changed much over the past year. These are people who can't follow simple orders in a raid and they fuck it up for everyone that's why 10 man is better, 1 retard versus 10 retards is way better.</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, that means Blizzard will be splitting its resources between raid creation and heroic creation, and some people seem to get REALLY angry about that idea. For those that wouldn't want Blizzard &quot;wasting&quot; their resources on making more heroics, what would you suggest as potential goalposts to give to heroic-only players to do once they've finished gearing? What sorts of targets should be driving them to continue running heroics?<br />
<br />
I feel like this conversation would go a lot better if we focused less on what heroic-only players *shouldn't* get and more on what they should (once they finish gearing up on a heroic level, that is). You don't like the current system? That's fine, but perhaps you should suggest a better one that will ensure heroic players have just as much fun and goals to work towards as a raider? Let's work on HELPING each other rather than taking potshots, eh?</div></div><hr />

IMO this will just separated raiders from casual players. A raider will be able to get nice shinny epics while the casual will be wearing blues for quite a while. Is what happen in vanilla. Remember that guy that have a pice of tier and you where wearing blues drooling on his epic armor? That is coming again. I am very happy with what blizzard is doing. They are fixing all their mistakes. WOTLK is boring and the rewards are ez to obtain. I have 4 80's full on epics while in vanilla i have a lvl 60 and in greens and blues, and i was spending less time on my alts trying to get the best stuff on my main. Uniqueness was lost, was given away. Now that many people are addict to epics they are making them work there a$$ off. Not only that they still making 25 man raids a prominent action. But as everyone knows and I bet 8 out of 10 people here had suffer from a fail 25 man raid due to ppl not showing up, etc. Not only that the guild swapping because this guild could get you epics quicker is over also. Now you get guild reputation you get awarded for been on the end tiers. For me Cata means, more quality players sticking together, a more L2P style. Really, realize it was time that a hard-core raider had the benefits of that hard work. So now you won't be in trade searching for a player with a particular GS. LOL GS is dead!<br />

Blizzard wants everyone to see their content, and offers the Hardcore teams a good challenge.<br />
<br />
But some people just can't handle it when their achievement is then attainable by &quot;anyone&quot; which is also a reason I would fully support removing the attainability of cosmetic rewards once the raid is tuned down.<br />
<br />
By cosmetic I mean Mounts/Titles etc, items that do nothing special for your character development wise. (and no.. 310% mounts also don't count to me.)<br />
<br />
The downgrading Epic to Rare is just game mechanics I guess. And we'll all be walking around in Epics when the next tier after T11 is released. Nothing can really be done about that I guess.<br />
<br />
Well, at least hardcore raiders have their achievement ranking on web sites like WowProgress, which award much higher points based on the date of the achieve. Maybe not the most rewarding thing to look at, but at least someone respectable acknowledges how much harder the achieve is if you're on the bleeding edge.<br />
<br />
Maybe Blizzard should do something similar with more of its achievements. They at least attempted something vaguely like this in Ulduar where some achieves can only be won in gear the raid was designed for.<br />
<br />
<br />
The lot of you seem to not understand what gear is, in sense of any RPG game. Gear is an ACHIEVEMENT ON ITS OWN. It's not the kind of money that you can accumulate slowly or fast, it's a have or dont have achievement. Always been like that in all the games, that's why what happens in WoW is pissing many people off. It's like asking for a stacking buff after each wipe on the lich king heroic until you 1shot him, or that if you wipe 1000 times on yogg-0 you would get mimiron's head in your mail box.

<br />
As about character progression and whatnot for casuals, let them progress in their own shallow pool, according to the difficulty of their achievements. have dungeon-1, dungeon-2, dungeon-3 sets after each raiding tier which would be lower level than raiding tier and look differently<br />
<br />
I suspect the reason Blizz will not do this is that it would make the barriers to entry too steep for new players. Even if you're really good, you would have a hard time ever catching up with players who have already been raiding the previous Tiers. It's a tricky balancing act, you see.</div></div><hr />

25 man should get more than 10 man. more people = harder to control/organize. They already took out better loot because blizzard is lazy so at least this way 25mans wont completely die.<br />

Ensidia = poor losers who value their self worth in life by beating arbitrary bosses as fast as possible because they are no good at anything else in life. At least I think that is the group of losers who are &quot;famous&quot; for pathetic reasons. So some losers quit because some people who don't have as much time to waste as them got similar gear in a digital world? Boo hoo, they're better off for it.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, I have no problem with them trying new systems out on live to see how they work for the more casual players. It, in my opinion, hasn't worked very well. Now we have GS rioters and people who do not know how to play their own class despite being handed some very good rewards. They have all the tools they need to get to the LK between gear and plenty of online guides such as tankspot. Yet, they cannot and their raids usually fall apart somewhere around Putricide or BQ Lana. <br />
<br />
I think they have done a great job giving opportunities to my truly casual rl friends. However, I don't think the best way to teach them how to play their class and work with others is through random heroics. I would be ok with the rest of the vp rewards being offered for jp's once the next raiding tier is out minus the tier gear. The tier 11 at that point should be purchasable only by a token from the corresponding raid at that point. They would have plenty of more jp rewards to get in and clear the t11 raid at that point. <br />
<br />
If you wanted a shorter version of why I stuck around so long. Plenty of my guildmates (3yrs in this guild) really were looking forward to getting the LK down for their own personal lore enjoyment. I'm not going to be part of the problem and bail on them especially after we lost so many core members when ToC was released.<br />
<br />
Also, I am still going to buy and enjoy Cata. Just not sure if it will be much fun once everyone is steamrolling heroics in 15 minutes again.</div></div><hr />

Why doesn't it? You have a &quot;daily&quot; now. The 1st heroic random you do is considered the &quot;daily&quot; hence why you get 2 frost badges and no more for the rest of your heroic randoms. <br />

<br />
From what I recall on PTR, every item is (CurrentPrice * 11.58) ... which means that everything costs the same as it does now, and the only difference is that you can save triumphs now and in effect use them to buy frost gear in a week. Bosses will give 16 JPs each after 4.0.1 instead of the 11.58 you get right now, but it also sounds like there is no bonus for doing random heroics beyond the first each day any more so you actually get less points per dungeon than you do now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and those people who quit were either getting carried which is extremely possible in a top tier guild or they were already getting tired of the game at that point and that little change just gave them a reason to &quot;quit&quot;. I wouldn't be surprised if they are playing again.</div></div><hr />

When I was a kid people had to FARM their own vegetables from scratch, now you can just buy it at the grocery store. boohoo why did I have to work so hard for them and everyone else gets some so easily. If you don't want to farm vegetables you should just eat bread, vegetables are for the elite only. I don't care if someone only has 2 hours a day to farm vegetables because they take care of sick kittens and i don't care if it took God 7 years to create the vegetables, only me and my 9 buddies should have some.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I was waiting for somebody to bring that up. You're mistaken. We're talking about *outright BUY* no additional costs (payments, insurance, maintenance, etc). We're trying to compare apples to apples here. People are bitching a person can save up Valor points and get a top tier item, no more additional costs after that. So, if you save up to buy a Porsche, straight out, with no additional costs, getting fired from Taco Bell would be irrelevant.<br />
<br />
It was a hypothetical situation that was brought up, so I went along with it to prove they were mistaken. Clearly, in order to insure proper comparison, we had to change the rules on the side of the Porsche to match the rules in game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mstieler</div><div class="date">2010-10-06, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ouch. not sure if anyone did some number crunching (and I don't want to read through 10 pages to see if they did) but here's what I came up with:<br />
<br />
Note: numbers are rounded up to the nearest whole number<br />
<br />
Justice Points:<br />
For a full set of Justice point rewards, you'll need 12800 Justice Points<br />
Note: this includes Chest, Hands, Head, Legs, Shoulder, Waist, &amp; Neck, since all classes will have those, and does not include the weapons/offhands available, since not all classes will use them.<br />
That equals 171 Cata Daily normal dungeon runs or Cata heroic dungeon boss kills (or a mix of the two).<br />
<br />
I'm not counting Wrath stuff, because that's a stupidly large amount of times you'd need to farm to get the cheapest piece of intro-to-raiding gear. For 1 (one) piece of offhand caster/shield/weapon gear, you're looking at 950 points. That's 42 Wrath Daily Heroics or Wrath Raid bosses, 60 Wrath Heroic bosses, or 80 Wrath Daily Regular dungeons, for a single piece of gear that will be replaced by a drop in ANY Cata raid.<br />
<br />
Valor Points (ooh, this is painful):<br />
There's a couple &quot;missing&quot; items I found here, which will throw the numbers off a little: no Agility DPS ring, and no Mail Spell DPS feet. I'm calculating the numbers as if those were there.<br />
For a full set of Valor point rewards, you'll need 12550 Valor Points.<br />
Note: this is for 3 T11 (Chest/Legs/Hands), Feet, Back, 1 Ring, Trinket &amp; Relic<br />
That equals 167 Cata Daily Heroic Dungeons or Cata 10-man boss kills, or 120 Cata 25-man boss kills (or a mix of the three).<br />
<br />
Oh, and don't forget your 2 Tier 11 tokens for your Head &amp; Shoulders. Can't forget those.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the pain, and welcome back to farming.<br />
<br />
Edit: for all the hate of casuals getting Tier, just note that casuals won't have their Head or Shoulders unless they can raid, and therefore can only get the 2-piece bonus at best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
30more points per boss is quite a &quot;buff&quot; in addition with more loot/player drop ratio. I'm pretty sure that the first people to do HC10 will be those guys who run 25man raids that get all they gear they need weeks(maybe months) before 10man guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Makes more sense for it to be just once a day.<br />
<br />
Daily Heroic would be the first one of the day. That one rewards valor points, but it's unclear from the announcement if subsequent heroics will give extra justice points similar to today's system. I actually hope they won't, since that'll mean there's more incentive to kill optional bosses instead of just rushing to the last boss and finish the instance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually if you look at how its set up.<br />
<br />
Tier 11 is buy-able via valor points, however only the hands legs and chest is, the shoulders and helm requires a token (look at the picture). So im assuming everyone can get 3/5 eventually if they don't raid but they won't have the shoulders and helm to show off epeens of their t11.<br />
<br />
So i'm guessing if it moved onto t12, it'll remain like that JP can only buy those 3, you still require to progress into the raid in order to get the other two, heres hoping theres no reskins of the tier pieces :)<br />
<br />
I'm also hoping t12 would be hard enough that you require atleast near-full t12 ilevel gear to finish say the last 3 bosses unless you're in a highly skilled raid, that forces people to farm t11 content in order to 'attempt' t12 successfully</div></div><hr />

I didn't start raiding until T2, and the grind to get my FR gear for MC, and then get my T1, so I could get into a guild doing T2 content, was long and time consuming. But that same grind made me value my gear 500% more than running a heroic once a day for a few months. Not to mention at that point there were guilds that suited just about everyone's abilities. If you weren't quite good enough for upper tier raiding, you just stayed in a guild that did lesser raids. If you didn't raid, you stayed in a leveling/social guild. Why do the social players need to raid and obtain tier? I decided to raid after seeing a warrior standing in SW wearing full T1, and I though it was the most amazing thing ever. At that point I had two purples, one of them my Krol Blade, and the other a drop I had gotten after lucking into a UBRS run. Epics were just that, epic. Epics are the new blues, and we're all worse off for it. <br />
<br />
And to those claiming their lack of time is why they need this ability to obtain easy epics and tier: Skunkworks (US). No more than 8 hours a week of raiding and they've downed H LK25. If you're running a heroic once a day you already have close to that amount of free time to spend in WoW. And if you don't have that amount of free time, you're never going to raid, so you have zero need for raiding gear other than to make heroics easier, thereby letting you farm them faster for more gear to farm them faster. You're doing the same content over and over, do you really need full tier to do that?<br />
<br />
And honestly, at the end of the day, I don't care who has what piece of gear, regardless of how difficult or easy it is to obtain. But the side effect of the daily heroic giving valor points is once again ensuring that raiders are going to need to run the heroic every day to remain competitive. That extra tier piece over 1 month across 10/25 players is considerable. Anyone that is lacking in time should hate this, because if you DO want to start raiding, it ensures that not only do you need to put in raid time, you need to run a daily heroic to stay in a progression guild. I hated it in T10/11, and apparently we'll continue the same grind. Honestly, if Blizz wants everyone to have some tier gear, just reward everyone with that 75 Valor points every day for logging in and checking our mail. Everyone wins right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sadly you don't say why a daily reward (like 2 Frost emblems now) is a failure to you. Or do you dislike the fact that people who are not as elite as you are also are able to get 1 epic piece, just not with raiding but with consistent saving over a long period of time?<br />

So you can farm now till limit of 4000 points on lvl80 and use them for 85 items ? :o<br />
<br />
Yes, you can and it is not even hard. I did a calculation and if you start today you only need to do ICC-10/25 4 bosses, 1 daily heroic and 1 daily dungeon to get your &quot;weekly&quot; fix. Most do more so getting 4000 points by 07-Dec-2010 is not really a problem. And I am not even counting any conversion in which makes it even easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is it such a bad thing for people who aren't hardcore raiders to get epic gear? If you raid consistently you will always have better gear than the social players who do their daily heroics and raid a little bit here and there. I understand your complaint about having to run a heroic every day to get the max amount of badges/points, I don't like that either but I am under the impression that there was going to be a cap on how many valor points you can earn per week. If that is the case then as long as you're killing a certain number of raid bosses per week, you don't have to worry about that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sambu</div><div class="date">2010-10-07, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those complaining that 25man :&quot;only gets 105&quot;, that's a 40% increase over the 75 given out in 10man, and you're getting more actual pieces of loot too. In ICC, you're getting the same amount of loot and badges, so it's definitely an upgrade, for getting 15 more people together. Also, to those complaining that you can buy tier from farming heroic dungeons, that's Blizzard's whole point to this. If you recall the end of the last expansion, Blizzard went on record saying that the reason they put in the widespread nerf to all raid boss' physical dmg and health, it was to make it easier to get most people the same equivalent gear, to prepare them for the expansion (since it's going to be outdated in 3 levels anyway).<br />
<br />
Also, for those who are complaining that we'll all have 4000 points to spend on the justice point items in cataclysm, you're forgetting something. With each new tier coming out, your Valor (raid) points will get converted to Justice points (at a less than 1:1 ratio), and your current Justice points are either dropping or taking a hit. If you max out your Justice points, you're not going to have 4000 to spend as soon as you hit 85. You're going to have a fraction of them available to you at 85. Sure, you might have enough points to buy 1 piece, but that's going to be it, most likely, and that's decent, but definitely not a HUGE advantage or something to whine/troll about.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to say, but you are quite frankly looking very ridiculous with your doomsday QQ. The 30 additional Valor Points are rewarded to 25-man raiders because they do not want to kill 25-man raiding (because it IS easier to find 10 people to raid with, rather than 25, which is simple math).<br />
The raids still share loot and lockout, and the last part of your QQ doesn't even make sense. Having to farm to get geared? ... Is that new?<br />

<br />
If you raid, you get a shot at raiding gear (because you need that to down raid bosses you know?), if you don't raid, why would you want/need it for 5man?<br />
<br />
That's the whole problem with the system. That's what support ppl only caring about purples/gear/showoff and thinking that raids are only worth up to the 1st token boss (hello &quot;sry, gotta go, emergency&quot; ppl who leave raids after the saurfang token rolls are done).<br />
<br />
Because once raiding starts, you people decked out in T11 will be bitching at anyone who can't keep up with you. Raiding DPS will keep pulling aggro off of non-raiding tanks while simultaneously bitching about how long their queue time is. Non-raiding healers won't be able to heal raiding DPS who don't pay attention to boss mechanics because they think it's beneath them while simultaneously bitching about queue times. Non-raiding DPS who don't do a bazillion DPS will get ridiculed and vote kicked despite the fact that this is their only way to get the gear that would keep them from being vote kicked.<br />
<br />
That's why they need raiding level gear.<br />
<br />
I know a guy who has, without raiding, gotten 4PCT10, the belt, the cape, and bought a broken hilt to get a 251 weapon. He never does vault, and never does the weekly raid. He put tremendous amounts of work into gearing his toon up. Why? Not to show off, cause he doesn't, but because it makes him happy. I guarantee he's put in more hours than most raiders at a comparable gear level, and I say he deserves to be happy with his gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, they took the tanking notes from the best of the highest end raiding guilds. Currently, tanks can't keep aggro on a boss after a minute or two (at lvl 80), so after a couple weeks of deliberating about how to fix the issue, blizzard increased the threat modifier. When cataclysm hits, they'll probably change the modifier back to a level that's more fun for the tank, but until then, it was a necessary change. These tanks are the best of the best, and working with dps that's just as good, blizzard didn't get these numbers from nubs.</div></div><hr />

Btw, Tier 11 gear is bought with Valor Points (with the exception of a couple items). Check the links posted for details on those.<br />

You're either wrong or lying. They always said that 10 and 25 man were sharing loot tables, but indicated from the beginning that 25 man would drop more gear (relatively speaking... so if 10 man drops one piece per boss, 25 will drop three or four) and award more points. That's how they intend to prevent the total death of 25 man raiding. From the earliest raiding first looks that's what they've said. You get the same stuff at both raid levels, but you get more of it at 25.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At any rate... getting a full set of D1, D2, T1, T2, D3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, and T10 on a character that just hit 80 a week or so ago is an achievement to me, so please just answer the question and stop trying to give a veteran player advice on how to spend her subscription money. ^^d It's a new main, I'm not a new player.<br />

I read posters saying the VP/week cap is 4000. Is that correct? A cap of (4000/75) i.e. 53 raid bosses a week doesn't seem like much of a cap. Is there a blue post on this; I could easily have just missed it. What is the cap?</div></div><hr />

<br />
THERE IT WILL BE A CAP FOR VALOR POINTS WEEKLY!!<br />
<br />
So you can do 10 man and a few heroics and you get the same than 25.<br />
<br />
Actually i think the cap will be betwen 1200-1500 VP per week.<br />
<br />
(full aproximately 15 bosses run 10 man = 1125 VP)<br />
(full aproximately 15 bosses run 25 man = 1575 VP)<br />
<br />
My english is not my primary language sorry :(<br />
<br />
PD: I dont remember the exact number of all raid bosses<br />
The number of bosses is going to be lower, but the upside is that there'll be more raids. Currently MMO-Champ has the bosses listed for two Raids, Blackwing Descent &amp; Bastion of Twilight. BD has 6 bosses, BoT has 4 (5th on hardmade or something similar). Its possible Throne of the Four Winds will be available at launch as well, though currently the Achieve for it list only 2 boss encounters. So, if you're able to run all of them, that's 12 bosses to clear (not sure if multi-boss encounters will grant points per boss, but its unlikely, since Blood council doesn't give you 6 Frost).<br />
<br />
Also, don't forget Baradin Hold as well. Not sure how it'll shape up, but if it's like VoA, you'll have 1 boss per Tier that'll give you points.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mercutiouk</div><div class="date">2010-10-07, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point is - there will be a cap on the amount of points you can collect in a week (unless they changed their mind on that). Someone doing 10m raiding will still need to do all their dailies etc etc etc to reach the cap for the week. Those doing 25m are likely to reach cap purely from a full clear of the relevant tier of content so it's much more time efficient for getting to the weekly cap.</div></div><hr />

And what exactly is it about having some T10 in my bank that I can pull out in two years when someone says &quot;remember Icecrown?&quot; that makes me a garbage player?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CloseTheWorld</div><div class="date">2010-10-08, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Am I calculating the following correctly?<br />
<br />
There are 8 Heroic 5-man dungeons in Cataclysm. Let's assume that, like WotLK, there are an average of four bosses per dungeon (I know one has seven).<br />
<br />
Heroic 5-man Cataclysm bosses award 75 Justice Points.<br />
<br />
Therefore, if you grind all eight heroics in a day, you'll receive 2400 Justice Points.<br />
<br />
According to the prices listed recently (I can't post links yet), items cost the following:<br />
<br />
Head: 2200<br />
Chest: 2200<br />
Legs: 2200<br />
Shoulders: 1650<br />
Gloves: 1650<br />
Belt: 1650<br />
Neck: 1250<br />
Off-Hand: 950<br />
<br />
Total: 13750 Justice Points.<br />
<br />
13750 / 2400 = 5.7<br />
<br />
So assuming an average of four bosses per Heroic 5-man, and completing all eight 5-mans each day, it would take roughly 6 days to acquire all Tier 11 gear, with the exception of main-hand, boots, rings and trinkets.<br />
<br />

<br />
You are NOT correct in this. T11 gear = epic gear only acquirable with VALOR points. You can only get 75 valor points a day from running heroics. Your numbers are more accurate if you were referring to getting all available vendor blues.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollia</div><div class="date">2010-10-08, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To everyone saying non raiders need to be able to farm heroics for the prior tier so they can get into raiding post release: did none of you play this game during vanilla and BC? I didn't start raiding until T2, and the grind to get my FR gear for MC, and then get my T1, so I could get into a guild doing T2 content, was long and time consuming. But that same grind made me value my gear 500% more than running a heroic once a day for a few months. Not to mention at that point there were guilds that suited just about everyone's abilities. If you weren't quite good enough for upper tier raiding, you just stayed in a guild that did lesser raids. If you didn't raid, you stayed in a leveling/social guild. Why do the social players need to raid and obtain tier? I decided to raid after seeing a warrior standing in SW wearing full T1, and I though it was the most amazing thing ever. At that point I had two purples, one of them my Krol Blade, and the other a drop I had gotten after lucking into a UBRS run. Epics were just that, epic. Epics are the new blues, and we're all worse off for it. <br />
<br />
And to those claiming their lack of time is why they need this ability to obtain easy epics and tier: Skunkworks (US). No more than 8 hours a week of raiding and they've downed H LK25. If you're running a heroic once a day you already have close to that amount of free time to spend in WoW. And if you don't have that amount of free time, you're never going to raid, so you have zero need for raiding gear other than to make heroics easier, thereby letting you farm them faster for more gear to farm them faster. You're doing the same content over and over, do you really need full tier to do that?<br />
<br />
And honestly, at the end of the day, I don't care who has what piece of gear, regardless of how difficult or easy it is to obtain. But the side effect of the daily heroic giving valor points is once again ensuring that raiders are going to need to run the heroic every day to remain competitive. That extra tier piece over 1 month across 10/25 players is considerable. Anyone that is lacking in time should hate this, because if you DO want to start raiding, it ensures that not only do you need to put in raid time, you need to run a daily heroic to stay in a progression guild. I hated it in T10/11, and apparently we'll continue the same grind. Honestly, if Blizz wants everyone to have some tier gear, just reward everyone with that 75 Valor points every day for logging in and checking our mail. Everyone wins right?<br />
<br />
As somebody who started playing WoW on vanilla release day, yeah I thoroughly remember those times and vastly prefer the current emblem/point reward set up. Why? Because the ability to rapidly gear up a player to be raid ready matters a TON. You didn't mention what guild you screwed over that geared you up with your T1 just so you could dump them and move on. Most of the guilds that were stuck on lower tier content weren't doing them because that was all they wanted to do, it was because they kept getting set back by losing their most geared players to the more advanced guilds who needed to fill holes in their roster caused by burnout, flunking out of school, spouses threatening divorce, etc etc. <br />
<br />
Personally, I play to raid. I do not want my raid to run into a brick wall because the available character pool of replacements is tiny because it is too time consuming for the majority of players to gear up. Why does gear mean a lot less emotionally to most folk now than it does in vanilla? Well it should be pretty obvious by now that all gear is transitory. Odds are any active toon will replace most of their gear every 6 months or so. Getting all misty eyed over individual pieces is kind of pointless given that fact.<br />
<br />
Do I think heroics should be faceroll easy? Absolutely not. Cata heroics require you to know your class. If the valor point earned-per-week cap is set low enough that almost all raiders can hit the cap through raiding alone the Cata heroics will STAY hard because the majority of people who seriously outgear them with raid gear just won't be running them. Under those conditions, people who have built up gear sets out of heroics really will have earned them.<br />
<br />
EDIT: What matters most to serious raiders is skill, translated as what you've managed to do and when you managed to do it. This is as it should be. No matter what gear the vast majority of players have or can get, the hardest encounters of the game are still going to be beyond most, at least within the current expansion.</div></div><hr />

Cataclysm raids don't award the same as Heroics, Justice Points are different from Valor points.<br />

<br />
Right.. you asked for a honest answer..so here it is: (It isn't hard to come up with it yourself and also ppl like me have been trying to hammer it out on the forums..but here goes)<br />
<br />
-people quit the game due to RL reasons<br />
-people do not all buy the game on release date<br />
-ppl get sick, break arms, suffer diseases<br />
-people burn out, quit, die..you name it<br />
-people join late..in short, not everybody joins at day 1 and plays day in day out. Some due to issues that are beyond their control.<br />
<br />
So you may assume, that the people who try to GET raiding gear WANT to raid. The great thing is (incidentally since Early 2008 when Isle of QD was released in TBC): Now when somebody returns to the game who has lost contact due to any of the above reasone, he can now gear up on his own without imposing on a guild and THEN JOIN THE RAIDS..instead of forcing his guild to go back to old raidcontent and gear him up. Or forcing him to find 24 equally delayed players who may or may not exist on his server.<br />
<br />
It really is so easy...don't assume that ppl who do not raid want or need raidgear...just assume they WANT to raid..and that is why they gear up for it. The items gathered from running endless heroics MOSTLY granted you quick full gear of the tier below the current raid tier. Ilv 232 and 245 from Triumph emblems without limit, but raiders had ilv 251-264 while doing current tiers.<br />
<br />
To gear yourself fully in Frost emblems, you needed 600 emblems. WITHOUT raiding, your 7 weekly heroics supplied you with 14. Your Voa and weekly raid (which actually were raids) supplied you with another 7.<br />
<br />
That would have been anything between 30 and 40 weeks to gear outside raids. That is a FACT. So why the hell do ppl moan if somebody even decides he will spend 40 weeks outside raids to get gear that we others, inside our raids get faster AND of higher quality WHILE HAVING EVEN MOAR FUN?.<br />
<br />
Do you ask why some guy drives a Porsche that goes 220 in the city? Do you really need 3 TVs in your home? Do you only do things because they absolutely make sense? Do you need 73 different flavoured chewing gums in your life? Why the hell do you need to apply rules that are fit for prisons or totaitarian regimes to a bloody video game and to people you don't know or don't even play with?<br />
<br />
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAnywasy..that said...I am standing right now at the Justice and Valor quartermaster and you can save all your buckets of tears because the system continues as it did in WotLK. between 700 and 1600 valor points for relics, cloaks, gauntlets and others.Those points come indeed ALSO from doing heroic dungeons as the newspage of this topic tells us.<br />
<br />
Tier gear CURRENTLY only comes from tokens dropping in raids. That is fair enough. But it will very likely become available for Justice or Valor points when the next tier of raidgear is released.<br />
<br />
What did you expect when Blizzard said &quot;The Wrath system of raiding was a success&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Decided to skim your post to see if it was worth reading fully and came across this that showed me it isnt. What would be great is if before you post you knew what you were talking about, especially when it comes to cata, JP and VP.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am standing right now at the Justice and Valor quartermaste<br />
T11 is NOT only from tokens. It is tokens AND 3/5 can be bought with valor points. i know it sounds cool when you say your actually doing something, but i can tell your not standing there when you posted this. how? cause I'm actually there and here is why. Yes i know, i looked at more then the first page of a vendors loot. shame on me.<br />

<br />
<br />
not the greatest image but its just to illustrate the point. As you can see, for the right price you can buy Chest, Legs and Gloves T11 for VP. When T12 is released any items bought with VP become purchasable with JP. Now the only thing we don't know yet is if they will put the Helm/Shoulders in for JP as well.</div></div><hr />

Not entirely sure about the only 2 tier lvls as the pictures show 3 but 3rd could be a non set item wich looks like the tier as it was in wotlk different color tho.</div></div><hr />
