Blue posts<br />
Ironbound/Rusted Proto-Drake Achievement Rewards removed in the future<br />
Sorry if there was any confusion on these mounts being removed in the future. I am working on getting an official response put together that covers the situation. There are some factors to consider, but we do plan to remove them. I have not heard of any plans to put in a replacement reward. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/17367881473-ironboundrusted-protodrake.html))<br />
<br />
All instances are full!<br />
The limit on the number of instances has been around for awhile now. We feel this was needed to preserve the game play for those already in the instances as it would eventually deteriorate when too many instances were up.<br />
<br />
That said, we do not feel feel this is a permanent fix and have been working on a more long term solution for quite awhile now. <br />
<br />
[...] There are no specifics I can provide at this time, but I can assure you we knew about this issue quite awhile ago when we had to start limiting the number of instances. This was never meant to be something we would put in and just ignore until players complained about it enough. I can assure you we are actively in the process of a more long term solution but these take a lot of time to plan out and implement so it won't be done overnight. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17368013775-all-instances-full--please-try-again-later.html))<br />
<br />
Is there any plan to remove some of the Argent Tournament rewards in 3.2?<br />
There are no plans to remove any of the rewards at this time. A couple of goblin quests though may be disappearing because, well, they will be done. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17367602877-argent-tournament-rewards-disappearing.html))<br />
<br />
Pure vs Hybrid classes<br />
At a grossly simplistic level, the two buckets we use are classes with single role (&quot;pures&quot;) versus multiple roles (&quot;hybrids&quot;). We don't make much of a distinction beyond that of how many healing specs a class can have or how many healing roles they can fill on a fight. The question is &quot;Can you reroll to fill a different role?&quot; For all healers, the answer is yes.<br />
<br />
You might see slightly more priests just because they can fulfill two different healing roles, but to be honest we are seeing a pretty big diversity in who is brought into Ulduar to heal (even for hardmodes) that has a lot to do with guild style, tradition, player skill and synergy. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17368013803-blizzards-viewpoints-on-healers.html))<br />

Hotfixing Heroic Strike<br />
We haven't changed Heroic Strike yet because just inflating its rage cost (or nerfing rage generation in general) would hurt warrior threat generation. This isn't in the zone of simple hotfix material. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17367602445-bring-back-the-old-shield-blockfix-war-block.html))<br />
<br />
Generating rage from damage only<br />
Having warriors only or mostly generate rage from damage done is an intriguing idea that has come up a few times. It would help the problem where better gear leads to rage starvation (at least in lower instances) and where warriors have trouble OT'ing because they aren't getting hit. It might also get warriors to care slightly more about dps stats instead of focusing mostly on survival stats. This would all apply to druids too. This isn't a change we have in the pipe, but it is something we discuss from time to time.

Its a vital part of our threat generation and warriors / druids are already quite weak compared to paladins / DK's. Putting a bigger focus on damage dealt can only be good but it shouldn't effect our threat negatively overall.<br />
<br />
Nerf DKs, Buff Warrior Aoe (reduce shockwave CD), Give Paladins another cooldown, druids seem reasonable to me atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I agree. Even with what GC said (or whichever one said it), I'm not real sure a solution was in the works. I do believe they put a cap on it before knowing, however, if they were actively seeking a fix, I doubt this ever would have become the issue it has become.<br />
<br />
Now however, it most definitely is an issue. Sometimes taking as long as an hour for a raid to get into an instance. That's unexceptable. Blizz knows this, and I'm sure they're working hardcore on it atm. But I wish they would have done figured out something before this.<br />
<br />
2ndarily, players aren't really helping the cause either. I was on in varying degrees of consistentcy throughout the day. A naxx10 instance was taken up by 2 people for over 8 hours. Same 2 people, druid and hunter. I can't believe that not only were they in there and online that long, but actively participating in killing stuff. Thus taking up the space another group or raid could be using.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
DPS needs hit to top the meters certainly, but the difference between most healing and spell damage gear isn't &quot;as huge&quot; as going from spell damage to agility / strength gear.<br />
Hence it's easier to switch between those specs if purely for the intent of going for 6-8 healers on a boss and having the others help damage the boss.<br />
<br />
Gearing up OS is a lot easier that way, you only need to swap out 2-3 pieces of kit to be able to maintain a respectable spot on the meters.<br />
Whereas otherwise you're looking at replacing 10-12 items that serve absolutely zero purpose in your offspec otherwise.</div></div><hr />

This is so retarded... CB was my biggest attack towards a mage or priest in PVP. However, CB still does hella damage compared to Incinerate (my CB crits for upwards of 16k in PVP whereas Incinerate around 8-10k). I say nerf Pally's/Rogues! I dont however agree that Warlocks are the weakest PVP class. I am for the most part always highest in damage, HK's, KB's and the least amount of deaths in a BG. There are days though that I die running across the field in WSG just to be crit 4x in a row by a rogue taking me from 24k hp to 0, over and over. My resilience is 928 and I sometimes question whether it's worth it or not.</div></div><hr />

Well with the 5 hord pets + Black tabby i will have 96.<br />
<br />
Higher learning is something im gonna try to go for - 97<br />
<br />
Getting the midsummer pets - atleast one - 98, if im very lucky and they boost the droprate on the scorchling - 99<br />
<br />
Then i need to get lucky with the baby crocks, but that gonna be hard. One way is to go engeenering to get one extra</div></div><hr />

----<br />
All instances are full!<br />
The limit on the number of instances has been around for awhile now. We feel this was needed to preserve the game play for those already in the instances as it would eventually deteriorate when too many instances were up.<br />
<br />
That said, we do not feel feel this is a permanent fix and have been working on a more long term solution for quite awhile now. <br />
<br />
There are no specifics I can provide at this time, but I can assure you we knew about this issue quite awhile ago when we had to start limiting the number of instances. This was never meant to be something we would put in and just ignore until players complained about it enough. I can assure you we are actively in the process of a more long term solution but these take a lot of time to plan out and implement so it won't be done overnight.<br />
----<br />
<br />
With this said, do you think Blizzard will solve this issue anytime soon? There isn't a day that hasn't gone by recently where we try to do a Heroic or a raid, and can't get into the instance. It's one of the most annoying things I have seen up to this point in WoW. We got through the 2-3 hour waits for WSG, AB, and AV back in vanilla WoW, the 1-2 waits for logging in to the server, and even that bout of nakedness people experienced back in BC days. I truly hope Blizzard solve this issue soon.</div></div><hr />

It's a cultural thing. It's even impolite in China to refer to bones in your food (e.g. &quot;I got a bone in my chicken soup&quot;). Instead you refer to them as something vague and positive like &quot;lump of wealth and happiness&quot; (poorly translated, of course).<br />

If you are of the opinion that you are already paying too much money for this game, why are you still paying? If the solution were merely &quot;purchase new equipment&quot; that would still take 6 months to a year to implement and even then you can only upgrade so much. Just throwing ram and processers at a new server isn't going to make it so an infinite number of people can magically play now, and a simple upgrade would probably not be of enough magnitude to truly meet the needed requirement.<br />
<br />
If you can't simply update the hardware, you have to update the software. I would be willing to bet that updating the software will cost Blizzard far more money in development time than simply updating the hardware...but if you JUST update the hardware then you still only implemented a temporary fix. They are working to streamline the entire process so a larger number of instances doesn't bog down the server processes.<br />
<br />
A software fix will go further to alleviate the issue both now and down the line, whereas a hardware fix merely solves the problem until the new higher limits are reached...at which point in time you still haven't solved the problem. They will eventually buy new hardware anyway, so a software solution is much more long term, and despite your belief, is more than likely far more expensive in terms of development time and resource allocation than simply purchasing more ram.<br />

Yeah but I'm assuming it won't be 100% balanced, This is blizz after all. Either it's going to help or hurt druids in pvp. gimme the 411<br />
<br />
<br />
It is intended to give druid's the option to go to caster or travel without feeling too squishy. It had gotten to the point that many druids just stayed in tree form the entire time for the added armor...but the imp barkskin change gives them the opportunity to spend more time in other forms at a much smaller armor loss.</div></div><hr />

Yeah bro spam dispell with your pet (assuming you're using felhunter) with that sweet 8 second cd dispel!!! That'll really get through the 20 buffs on a priest/mage to dispel their shield.

Hence it's easier to switch between those specs if purely for the intent of going for 6-8 healers on a boss and having the others help damage the boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
But also, if the healer has dual specs, then they should have the gear for that offspec, so really, it shouldn't matter at all.</div></div><hr />

I dont use the felhunter much but I suppose I will. I'm really liking the bubble form the voidwalker now. I'm not sure if it still pierces, I'm under the assumption from the post I quoted on.

As per a GC post from sometime last week, or the week before:<br />
<br />
Chaos Bolt will still pierce Absorbtion Mechanics: Power Word Shield, Anti-Magic Shell, etc. As it was intended to do.<br />
It won't pierce Damage Reduction Mechanics: Icebound Fortitude, Shield Wall, etc. As this was not its intent.<br />
<br />
Or something like that. The post is floating around somewhere, and was on one of the news posts sometime in the past week or so on MMO here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now chaosbolt is just the same as incinerate only with a different color BUT with a cooldown. Nothing to spend 51 talents in. How will we even be able to kill a priest now? ( melee are already almost impossible to kill)<br />
<br />
warlocks are already the weakest pvp class in both 1vs1 and arena (2vs2 and 3vs3)<br />
<br />
<br />
a) I don't know exactly how the damage resist mechanics change is going to play out, but even if it is the way you assume it is, it affects only deep destro which will remain superb for pve. There have been and will continue to be several specs that are significantly better for pvp. Last season had an abundance of top-rated DK-Pally-Lock 3v3 teams... were they all dependent on chaos bolt? I doubt it.<br />
<br />
b) Even with a nerf to chaos bolt, I expect deep destro will still be able to 3-4 shot most classes in 1v1. It will just be more important to use fear and pets to provide enough distraction to get those 3-4 shots off. In BGs, its already pathetically easy because the other players provide the distraction. Melee classes that get in melee range will continue to be tough. This is no surprise and changing chaos bolt has no impact on that whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

You can easily upgrade cpus to squeeze in more instances. YOu can add memoryand increase available pools of resources. The software side of the story, no one but blizzard knows the issues there.

For people who play during peak times because of jobs, family, kids and wife not being able to run a dungeon for 5-10 mins will often make or break the group and eventually the game.<br />
<br />
I bet many of the instance ids are simply solo people farming crap.. perhaps blizz should put a 2-3 person limit on instances during peak to keep farmers out and free up instances. (so if there isn't a party it won't let you in.. )</div></div><hr />

You totally missed my point...if the argument is Blizzard is trying to save money by not upgrading servers, then that argument is totally bogus as the software development costs just as much money, and probably more, than simply upgrading the system.<br />
<br />
They have already said, their servers are not that far off of front of the line. They upgraded shortly before the release of WotLK. The increase in hardware would not make a huge difference at this point. They can either address the problem from a software perspective and be done with it...or they can upgrade the servers and allow X more groups to run at a time...and then run into the same issue once that limit has been reached.<br />
<br />
I fully understand how relatively simple it is to upgrade hardware. I've built computers for myself and my family. Upgrading the servers won't fix the problem. It will bandaid it, but it still won't fix the problem. People say &quot;why are they such cheap bastards! Why don't they just buy the equipment!&quot; They are spending far more money devoting development time to ACTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEM than they would to simply buy new equipment and band aid it for another couple months or a year.<br />
<br />
Perhaps my vision is skewed because I play on a low pop server...but chances are high that if someone here, who has more than likely never stepped foot in a game design team or been a part of a project as large as WoW, can think of a &quot;simple solution&quot;...it has probably been considered. Perhaps Blizzard is just a bunch of cheap ass bastards and they're stealing my money and just hoarding it for themselves rather than making the product I pay for better...but devoting development time to a problem rather than throwing hardware at it is hardly the proof that I'm looking for.<br />

So they devote another 6 months to squeak out another X instances per server. So 6 months from now you have your hardware fix. 4-5 months later the instance servers are maxed out again. It takes time to update an infrastructure the size of WoW. Chances are, the week they moved on installing the new hardware, maintenance would be extended several hours and people would come to MMO and QQ about how shitty WoW's development team is...it's funny how that works isn't it? Updating your PC so it has more ram is a piece of cake. Now go to a database center and update the ram and CPU's for several hundred servers simultaneously and hit the power switch. I betcha it works first time!!!</div></div><hr />

I think the concern is that all instances (raid, heroic, all the way down to RFC and arena) use a single pool of IDs, and there's a cap on that pool because there are physical hardware limitations on how many instances the system can handle at once. My *guess* is that they'll address this by lowering the amount of overhead each instance requires and improving the sharing of resources between instances.</div></div><hr />

Now chaosbolt is just the same as incinerate only with a different color BUT with a cooldown. Nothing to spend 51 talents in. How will we even be able to kill a priest now? ( melee are already almost impossible to kill)<br />
<br />
warlocks are already the weakest pvp class in both 1vs1 and arena (2vs2 and 3vs3)<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you stupid?<br />
<br />
First of all; Chaos Bolt deals a significant larger amount of damage.<br />
<br />
Second; it will always hit for a larger amount of damage, since it ignores resistances and the likes.<br />
<br />
Third; it will still do all that after the patch. The only thing that has changed is that you can no longer bypass other classes' panic-buttons like Last Stand, Dispersion or Pain Suppression (which was quite heavy for an ability that does all of the above and only has a 12sec CD).<br />
<br />
Fourth; Chaos Bolt has not only been nerfed. I.e. it's damage was increased by a great amount a while back, which made it as powerful as it is now.<br />
<br />
Also, you're an idiot, warlocks are far from being the worst class in PvP, you can still pew-pew through shields and whatnot. Stop crying, wipe your tears and find yourself a rogue that is good enough to carry you.<br />
<br />
Please quit the senseless, brain-cell degenerating, and rage-provoking whining and bitching about things you apparently know nothing about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mostly I agree with what you've said, but you are drawing a strawman argument, here. The options aren't to fix it in software forever or address it temporarily in hardware (I'm guessing, he I expect I'm close to the mark, having worked on many such scaling issues in the real world).<br />
<br />
Rather I would expect that it's a matter of getting a large bump by improving the scalability of the software or a small bump out of increasing server count. Ideally, they will combine these two approaches, adding some physical capacity while improving how much overhead each instance ID requires. For example, how much of each instance do you need to keep &quot;alive&quot; (e.g. mobs moving around and doing their thing) at any given time? Some of that depends on line-of-sight issues and there's probably a good bit of improvement to be had there. They can probably also identify instance IDs that are not currently in use and archive them in a way that allows them to not be counted against the total (though that means that when a raid is re-activated it would have to acquire a new slot, which might not be available).</div></div><hr />

The limit on the number of instances has been around for awhile now. We feel this was needed to preserve the game play for those already in the instances as it would eventually deteriorate when too many instances were up.<br />
<br />
That said, we do not feel feel this is a permanent fix and have been working on a more long term solution for quite awhile now. <br />
<br />
Thats a joke right?<br />
Buy some servers that can carry a load? I bet Blizz could afford 3 extra Raid/Ini servers per Realm without going into red figures!<br />
Maybe offlay some work on servers abroad? I'm sure in Japan at 3 AM there isn't as much load on a server as in Europe at the same time (time zones). Who cares if neutral bugs, bunnies and mice have a 300 or so ping?<br />
&quot;a permanent fix&quot;... there is such a thing in scaling usage? laughing my ass off!<br />
<br />
To all those talking about updating servers... why bother? let the old ones run, and add another one to the pool! (whoever thinks each realm has one big server should be shot anyways) The settings can be done offline to 99% the 1% missing is adding it to the pool.<br />
<br />
A software fix will be far more expensive than just buying new servers. Just imagine the base code you have to optimize... those things give programers nightmares!<br />
<br />

A hint for Blizz: If you're running out of server storage, learn from google! Find the spot where lowest property prices meet the cheapes fibre-optic cable and you got the new server location.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CSJenova</div><div class="date">2009-06-03, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mostly I agree with what you've said, but you are drawing a strawman argument, here. The options aren't to fix it in software forever or address it temporarily in hardware (I'm guessing, he I expect I'm close to the mark, having worked on many such scaling issues in the real world).<br />
<br />
Rather I would expect that it's a matter of getting a large bump by improving the scalability of the software or a small bump out of increasing server count. Ideally, they will combine these two approaches, adding some physical capacity while improving how much overhead each instance ID requires. For example, how much of each instance do you need to keep &quot;alive&quot; (e.g. mobs moving around and doing their thing) at any given time? Some of that depends on line-of-sight issues and there's probably a good bit of improvement to be had there. They can probably also identify instance IDs that are not currently in use and archive them in a way that allows them to not be counted against the total (though that means that when a raid is re-activated it would have to acquire a new slot, which might not be available).<br />
<br />
<br />
I would completely agree with you that software will not be the end all be all of their solution. I was trying to point out that the &quot;throw money at the servers&quot; solution wouldn't be the simple end all solution many people like to say it is. Because they're not buying hardware they're clearly not using the money we pay them.<br />
<br />
At the WoW is dieing comment from another poster...a fairly small portion of end game raiders are getting fed up with the game and leaving...this is true. The game is also becoming more accessible than ever to new players and people with smaller groups of friends. Making raids harder to smite the &quot;fucking casuals&quot; would hardly fix the issue as 25 &quot;fucking casuals&quot; taking up 1 instance is taking up a HELL of a lot less server space than those 25 &quot;fucking casuals&quot; running 5 mans. But that wouldn't give you yet another opportunity to bitch about Blizzard's &quot;failed raiding experiment&quot;. Let's ignore that members of high end guilds have said that the content intended to be difficult is just as technically challenging as the content people bitch and moan about wanting all over again. The challenge is there if you want it...getting more people in raid instances is helping the &quot;problem&quot;...not hurting it. Having 500 people solo'ing UD strat for their baron mount is hurting the instance servers more than &quot;fucking casuals&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Buy some servers that can carry a load? I bet Blizz could afford 3 extra Raid/Ini servers per Realm without going into red figures!<br />
Maybe offlay some work on servers abroad? I'm sure in Japan at 3 AM there isn't as much load on a server as in Europe at the same time (time zones). Who cares if neutral bugs, bunnies and mice have a 300 or so ping?<br />
&quot;a permanent fix&quot;... there is such a thing in scaling usage? laughing my ass off!<br />
<br />
To all those talking about updating servers... why bother? let the old ones run, and add another one to the pool! (whoever thinks each realm has one big server should be shot anyways) The settings can be done offline to 99% the 1% missing is adding it to the pool.<br />
<br />
A software fix will be far more expensive than just buying new servers. Just imagine the base code you have to optimize... those things give programers nightmares!<br />
