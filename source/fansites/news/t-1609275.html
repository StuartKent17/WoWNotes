Smash ‘n Grab—Bonus Chance to Get Your Heirloom from Garrosh<br />
Garrosh got an iron-tight grip on your heirloom? It’s time to Smash 'n Grab (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/174983-smash-n-grab)! Beginning Tuesday, October 14 and lasting until the launch of Warlords of Draenor on November 13, we’ll be giving players a bonus 100% chance to get their first Garrosh heirloom weapon in each difficulty* of Siege of Orgrimmar. If you have yet to claim an heirloom for your collection, here’s your chance. Once Warlords of Draenor goes live, these heirlooms will no longer be available, so get involved in the siege before it’s too late.<br />
<br />
*Not available in Raid Finder. Note that the bonus only applies in raid difficulties in which you have not received an Heirloom already. If you have already received an Heirloom from a specific difficulty, the bonus will not have any effect. <br />
<br />
<br />
Pandaria Awaits – World of Warcraft Now Includes Mists of Pandaria<br />

In addition, all World of Warcraft subscribers will now automatically have access to all of the content and features of Mists of Pandaria, even if they never purchased the expansion, at no additional cost.<br />
<br />
It’s time to part the mists, adventurer — Pandaria awaits!<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Stat Squish*<br />
If any particular creatures aren't properly squished, be sure to report them by name in the Bug Report forum so we can hotfix these as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
As an aside, Patch 6.0.2 is the biggest change World of Warcraft has ever seen, particularly on the technical side with file structure and coding, as well as on the mechanical side with things like the stat squish, ability pruning, etc. There are bound to be some unforeseen bugs or other issues, which is why we have all hands on deck ready to pounce on these as we find them. With your help and patience we'll get things sorted even faster.<br />
<br />
And this wasn't done in the PTR why? Just get rid of the PTR since you all at Blizzard seem to think that it's better to piss off the players with buggy, nonfunctional patches instead of fine-tuning them first!<br />
You seem to presume that thousands of players were anxious to hop on the PTR and jump into Terrace of Endless Spring LFR, or run countless other pieces of older content in order to find that one mob that hits too hard. Like I said, this is a huge patch and a ton of very core mechanics of the game have been altered in ways that impact every player and NPC in the world. We're bound to have missed a few things and will address them as quickly as we can.<br />
<br />
The PTR process is still immensely useful for catching bugs, particularly client-crashing, game-breaking bugs which we prioritize over smaller things. It's not a black-or-white, all-or-nothing situation as you implied with your &quot;get rid of the PTR&quot; comment. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately?), it's more complicated. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344580-you-completely-messed-up-the-stat-squish/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14882118236?page=1#15))<br />
<br />
Worgen Skin Customization Fix*<br />
Welcome to 6.0.2! We’re in the process of tracking a couple dozen or so hotfixes we’ve implemented, or are in the process of implementing, and we’ll be updating the 6.0.2 Hotfixes blog as they come in.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, we wanted to bring up an issue we’re looking into with Worgen skin options. Worgen (or Gilnean, if you prefer) characters are pretty unique in that their customization options are linked between each form (Human and Worgen). As work progressed on updated character models for 6.0.2, there was an error in how we numbered the texture files used to set which skin tones are linked between them. Some Worgen players out there are seeing a pretty stark mismatch, which is due to the game simply pointing at the wrong texture file. While it’s a simple error, it does require a client-side change to correct. We’re in the process of working on a client side patch to address this and a few other issues, and we’re working to get that out tomorrow if possible.<br />
<br />
We’re excited to take this first giant step toward Warlords of Draenor with you, we’re continuing to read your feedback, and hope you’re enjoying fighting off this first wave of the Iron Horde invasion. As always, thanks for playing, and we’ll see you in-game! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344586-worgen-skin-customization-fix/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14881248215?page=1#1))<br />
<br />
Proving Grounds Titles<br />
We're aware of the issue with missing Proving Ground titles and are working on a hotfix to address this. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344493-proving-grounds-title-gone/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14882338135?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
Ordos and Legendary Cloak Requirement<br />
Edit: Spoke too soon. The change below has been reverted. Eligibility for loot from defeating Ordos has not changed. It still requires one of the characters on an account license to have obtained the Legendary Cloak.<br />
<br />
<br />
Access to Ordon Sanctuary or eligibility for loot from Ordos no longer requires players to have completed the Legendary Cloak questline.<br />
(Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344487-still-cant-do-ordos-w-no-cloak/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14881658078?page=1#13))<br />
<br />
Archeology Toys<br />
Name says it all. Farmed up a metric ton of them a long time ago. Achievements are in my book but I don't have the items anymore. Ran out of bag space. Any chance there's a way to recover these with 6.0.2 with the inclusion of the Toys UI?<br />
You may be pleasantly surprised on login. My characters automatically pre-learned toy items that my characters have obtained via Archeology without having to learn them. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344484-can-we-get-our-archeology-toys-back/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14872337160?page=2#22))<br />
<br />
New Character Models<br />
Sorry to hear you're not enjoying your updated character! As others have mentioned, we've added facial customization options to the in-game barbershop, which will allow you to change additional appearance options for an in-game gold cost.<br />
<br />
With the old models looking as... old, as they did, there's always been some amount of interpretation that's going to happen from person to person as they fill in the quality-gaps, and add their own story and character to any of the looks. Where a squiggly blurry line might look like a scar to you, it might look like freckles to someone else. A furled brow is grease smudge, a wince is a grimace, or a smile is a pout. We went into the archives, back to the source material and textures, and spent a lot of time trying to ensure we were interpreting all those squiggles and smudges in a way that is as true to the originals as possible, while also updating them to much higher resolutions and levels of fidelity. No easy task, I assure you. We expect that some will have had different interpretations of those old blurry textures than the ones we arrived at, and that's why we brought some of the recustomization features in-game for &quot;free&quot; (small gold cost like other barbershop features), and with that you can hopefully find new combinations and options that do appeal to you.

<br />
Professions and Gold in Warlords of Draenor<br />
Unless you have a huge stockpile, gold is going to be an important asset in Warlords. But, beyond that, professions are still poised as they always have been, as a way to create high end items and special rewards for you and your friends, as well as to sell or trade your masterful experience as goods and services. Beyond items that will help fill itemization gaps as you'll get into raiding, there's the standard cadre of bonus items, toys, mounts, etc. that specific professions can create. There's also a lot of interplay between which professions you have/don't have, and how your building selections in the Garrison will benefit or offset your skills. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/344445-so-what-is-the-point-of-professions-now/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14872737176?page=2#26))<br />

Gaze of the Black Prince Buff Ended Early<br />
It was our understanding that the Gaze of the Black Prince buff would be removed when the realms were brought down to apply Patch 6.0.2. In reality, the buff was set to expire at 12:00 a.m. this morning. At this point it's not likely that we'll be able to reactivate the buff so that it's available for these waning hours prior to patch launch. We apologize for the discrepancy between our messaging and the actual timing of the buff's removal. It wasn't our intent to mislead or confuse anyone.

Heirloom Vendor Change in Patch 6.0.2<br />
theres this situation where people probably have just started playing WoW again or are new to wow and they like to catch up on things during the game, i bet you dont take too many breaks from wow seing how far you went into that post of yours.<br />
If they're new to the game they wouldn't be able to purchase heirlooms until they're already leveled. If they're returning, again, they may be lvl 80 or 85 and they're probably not going to be buying any (especially because they won't provide them much if any benefit at that level) unless they do have 90's but are returning to just level alts--which seems super specific. I'm still unsure of in what scenario new players or people returning to the game are specifically and unfairly being affected by this.<br />
<br />
Which is of course not bringing up, again, heirlooms will still be available from other vendors for different currencies. Or that, if you want to right now, you could pretty easily grind out the JP needed to buy any heirlooms you want in the next couple days before 6.0.2.<br />
<br />
How long have you guys been working on WoD already? How long have you known all of this was going to change? How bad do you think it looks that a month prior to the release you STILL haven't figured this out.<br />
An account wide heirloom system wasn't as high a priority as other changes and content. Features and content are routinely delayed or cut from expansions as we work on them and priorities and design ideas and philosophies change. It's how we've always worked. Making a game is more of an art than a science, and we think it works better when there can be a personal touch and influence on the game design and direction, and not a rigid schedule to adhere to.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to answer your question, we were in the process of changing the heirlooms to cost gold and thought &quot;wait a minute, this is going to maybe suck if the new system changes the valuation considerably&quot;. So, specifically, maybe a day before the original post?<br />
<br />
But again, help me understand. Why did this not come across during meetings about it when you had them? Maybe we're not privy to the knowledge, but the, &quot;Well, we didn't realize it would be all screwy until just a short time ago!&quot; thing...honestly, it puts a REALLY bad taste in my mouth, personally speaking.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong.<br />
<br />
I understand more than most prioritizing things. However, if a change is coming down the pike, do you not first examine ALL options thoroughly before deciding on what will work best? This reeks of throwing stuff at a wall and seeing what sticks, man.<br />
Mmmm, not sure if I can answer satisfactorily as this seems to be a judgment of our working processes, which I'm not sure necessarily can or should be justified. If we do something you don't like, tell us why, I don't know that trying to ensure our producers are using &quot;Agile&quot; is super helpful. But anyway, things change, and they can change at any step. Obviously in meetings where designs are discussed, things change thousands or times in little or substantial ways. They can also change during testing, or as we approach a milestone, or at 2am when a designer wakes up in a cold sweat screaming &quot;OH NO!&quot;, or during implementation, or a billion other small ways. You're perceiving change as a weakness, when in reality our ability to change and adapt to new conditions or thoughts or ideas, is a major strength.<br />
<br />
It seems like you're wanting to shame us for not being able to see the future, or for prioritizing tasks properly (in the scheme of a new expansion, what old heirlooms will sell for is not super high up there), which seems odd and unfair.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to agree with all the claims about pushing the paid 90 boost. That's the only thing that makes sense.<br />
*grumble* Except everyone gets a boost included with Warlords and also heirlooms are still purchasable with other currencies. If the intent is to propose what-if scenarios as real problems, I'll discuss them all day, but please don't bring conspiracy theories in. There's no logic to what you're proposing.<br />
<br />
Why is this even a concern? You've placed a monetary value on Justice Points. You've placed a gold value on the guild heirlooms. This is just repeating a bad excuse for a last minute change. One that doesn't even influence the gameplay in the new expansion. It's a convenience item for &quot;veteran&quot; players. <br />
There's no monetary value on JP. We're offering a payout for time spent as the currency is being removed so people aren't sad for having JP they didn't spend. It's a nice thing to do. It is not a literal valuation of time spent. And there just isn't a parity with the guild heirlooms. Just because both items are heirlooms doesn't mean they should both suddenly be obtainable the same way through the same systems.<br />
<br />
I do indeed understand some people would love for heirlooms to be purchasable with gold.<br />
<br />
Again, maybe you did this. I don't know. But it surely seems to me that you (Blizzard) just took the path of least resistance and hoped for the best without really THINKING about it and have inconvenienced MANY players with nothing more than, &quot;Oopsie daisy!&quot;.<br />
I think it was more along the lines of, ok we're removing Valor and Justice Points, this is a change that affects dozens of systems, thousands of items, millions of players, let's discuss the key impacts, but it's going to take months for designers to work through how each should be resolved in each system, for each player, let alone implement, test, bug fix, reimplement, test, bug fix, etc. etc. and it would be nonsensical for us to sit and discuss each minutiae of the change for old currencies instead of doing work to make an awesome expansion.

Patch 6.0.2 - Alliance and Horde Choppers<br />
Today's patch added the Horde chopper mount, but it looks like Alliance players will have to wait (https://twitter.com/TheCrafticus/status/522130504686899202) a little longer to buy their mount.<br />

The answer is simple. Ghostservers ain't ghostservers anymore. A lot of players quit instead of transfering. Unfortunately those have not been enough to make Blizz react earlier cause they still got more than enough money from the fools that paid for transfers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They release the names of people who havent logged in since 13 of november 2008(launch of wrath of the lich king).Which means by 13th of nomember 2014,its for people who never logged in for six years and the full duration of 3 expasnions.You may also call it the 60% of wow's life.<br />
If people never came back during this time,chances are they dont want to play this game anymore so why &quot;lock&quot; their names and deny other people the right to use them?There is a reason they selected such an old date and not like,the one MOP got released<br />
<br />
Plus if someone buys sub after SIX years of absence just to keep his name on an mmo which he stopped playing so long ago and probably wont start again now,something is really wrong with him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all rep,garrison and achievements have nothing to do with heirlooms neither now or after the patch.<br />
Secondly,because people were using dungeons JUST to get the JP for looms ( and that did require some time of grinding)<br />
In order to gem them you had to work(play),in the end you would feel a small satisfaction for getting em. (and by the money side,blizz makes you play longer)<br />
<br />
But if you buy all of them with gold ( not just the guild ones),its just : click,click,click done.(Gold becomes easy to get in WOD so getting the amount needed for looms would barely take any time).<br />
<br />
Finally they said the gold gained from current jp is not fair ( think about it,its 50 gold per hc boss and we are nuking dungeons atm) and they only did it so that peole who had JP in storage would not get a big FU in their face</div></div><hr />

Perhaps it's just nostalgia at work, or perhaps it's a sign of things to come when WOD finally arrives. It's a promising start for Blizzard, though.</div></div><hr />

Its not finished. You have to count subs gained up to the launch of the expansion. I guarantee more will come back. 8m subs is not an unreasonable number to guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you? It has been on sale for months.<br />
<br />
I guess this answers about whether or not they counted all those free wows they gave out. Seems like the counting the free month they gave with the game trumped the not counting the free game part...<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft subscribers include individuals who have paid a subscription fee or have an active prepaid card to play World of Warcraft, as well as those who have purchased the game and are within their free month of access. Internet Game Room players who have accessed the game over the last thirty days are also counted as subscribers. The above definition excludes all players under free promotional subscriptions, expired or cancelled subscriptions, and expired prepaid cards. Subscribers in licensees’ territories are defined along the same rules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably the silliest logic I've heard on these forums. People in the normal world aren't like the forum-goers here. They don't quit WoW and then continue to haunt the forums to make fun of and poke at the game they used to play. They move on and don't pay attention to any of the developments. Need proof? Look at all the threads from people saying 'I resubbed, what should I do first,&quot; etc. It's highly unlikely that someone who hasn't played for 6 years would see the news announcement about releasing names and then buy a month's subscription just to keep it saved when he's not even playing anymore.<br />
<br />
It's also funny how people think that Blizzard promising incentives to people who return is being &quot;tricky&quot; or something. It's standard marketing. Banks will send out tons of post cards promising $100 if you set up an account there. Cable companies will often offer price discounts to customers who threaten to cancel. The examples go on and on. Classic marketing tactic and this shows that it works.</div></div><hr />

Trends usually continue, and not spike to unexpected numbers like 8M. You'll see, even if WOD would be super awesome expansion, people won't return. It's not that easy to get subs back to 10 year old game even with really really good exp. People they lost (like me) moved on and no matter how good WOD is, they will consider but in the end they won't resub to an old game and try and play new games. Simple really.</div></div><hr />

Since subs apparently decide quality, we'll have loads of fun talking about how classic and BC were worse than Cataclysm<br />

Then again no one with even a tiny lick of sense uses sub numbers to gauge quality, especially not considering the game has been active for a decade.</div></div><hr />

I really think WoTLKs success was because they advertised it well. WoW was a big hit coming outta TBC and the 'What's your game?' ads with Ozzy, Mister T, Van Damme,etc helped to get the game out in the eyes of a lot of people. Unfortunately that flood of people have partially left in masses to do other games,life,etc. <br />
<br />
If the Warcraft movie ends up becoming a huge success in the box office I would expect to see a ton of new people playing the next WoW expansion</div></div><hr />

The majority of people who came in as the game grew and neared it's peak are well above 20 now. What hype is there for a decade old game at this point? Nearly none outside of this very community the game has left. Which is still gigantic by all measurements.<br />
<br />
I just get frustrated at the shortsightedness. Yeah congratulations WoW grew in subs when it were only a few years (still amazing) and eventually peaked which was inevitable by all accounts. Damn by some people you'd think the game would grow 300k/month indefinitely (woo 36~ million subs now!) in order to be doing well in terms of quality.<br />
<br />

They're bitching because JP loom vendors are being removed until a loom overhual comes in a patch.<br />
<br />
Most of it is white knight-ing for &quot;The people what will becoming back to WoW and want to level and army of alts.&quot; Which I dont really get, but I'm not the brightest bulb. The others were complaining about needing to grind too much for JP, which really isnt hard to grind for.<br />

<br />
Not at all. WOW is hovering around that 7.5 million point for a few quarters already. It simply is the level off point.<br />
<br />
Many people forget WOW has had 25 million active players over all these years.<br />
<br />
If only a fraction return it simply is expressed in 100's of thousands new (returning) players.<br />
<br />
And since there really is no decent alternative for LONG term MMO play these days, WOW is the main attraction tool right now.<br />
<br />
WOD numbers will be over 8 million with ease.<br />
<br />
IF you wanna play a long term game, you play &quot;the&quot; game know for this. Simple really.<br />
<br />
And ... btw Hearthstone did have a role in attracting old players to the &quot;big&quot; game behind it, for that I am sure.</div></div><hr />

The rest is in intensive care or went free to play to attract the same dudes like you ... :)<br />

100% agree. When I was sure I would quit wow in 2009, I had enough of it and I actually didn't visit any wow site because I wasn't interested in it - I also didn't spend time badmouthing the game just because I wasn't interested anymore. In my 4 month break recently I knew I might come back and I was interested and kept visiting the site, also not mindlessly badmouthing. <br />
<br />
The people with the combination of hating the game but still visiting the games fansites taking sh*t is something I will never understand. It's quite sad actually.. if you don't like the game why the heck to you waste time on a site about what you hate!? Blows my mind.</div></div><hr />

For 1 and 2, there's news items for them like once every four months. No one in their right mind would come to MMO-Champion for anything other than Wow news. And the forum? I hate Minecraft. I didn't even know the forum had a Minecraft section. I would never visit that forum, because why would I? Normal people don't go searching for things they don't care about.<br />

You care. Of course you care. You're like a jealous ex who can't stand watching your old flame having fun with someone else. It's okay. But pretending like you don't care is just pathetic.</div></div><hr />

This exactly.. when I had my WoW haitus during all of Cata and part of MoP, I didn't even BOTHER going on MMO champion. At all.<br />

I didn't like Cata, but I didn't dedicate the rest of my free time to shitting on it on forums. Honestly I wish I had the kind of free time those people have to sit and whine about a game they don't even play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW would seem to have maybe three years left before it reaches a point where it becomes just as relevant as the original EverQuest and Ultima Online.<br />
<br />
Even if it replicates its drop from the beginning of Cataclysm, it'll be around 2.5-3 million subscribers in 4-5 years. Far from &quot;Everquest and Ultima Online&quot; territory. And if Blizzard slows the bleeding at all (reversal probably isn't possible for a game this old), it'll have even more years with multi-million subs.</div></div><hr />

2month old. So if you want to appear as anything other then a delusional forum-goer who makes things up, you'll have to find a more recent source that says they have &gt;300k<br />
<br />
mmo-champion rule Super Data Research:<br />
Super Data Research estimates can only be cited as objective facts and official data from experts in the field with connections to the industry, trumphing everyones facts or opinions, if the estimates appear in favour of WoW. <br />
Otherwise they are just speculation from no ones and even declining google search queries for a fanforum of the game after the launch make more objective data about any other games population than SuperData numbers. Not offical. Unacceptable.<br />
They wan't to have it both ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
A drop, since the next sub call is in February in all likelihood.<br />
<br />
Maybe about as much as Cataclysm gained?<br />
Altough I think WoD hype was relatively tame compared to Catacyclysm so it might have not yet reached it's full potential.<br />

Well there is the 6.0.2 patch they had released the same day they announced these numbers.<br />
And there is an expansion just around the corner. And Blizzard made sure to add more reasons making player feel pressured to remain subscribed or to resubscribe than ever before.<br />
<br />
But that could just be me imagining things.</div></div><hr />

This 600k jump includes neither. Get it?<br />
<br />
You seem to be thinking that the 600k people are a totally different group of people from the ones that would come back with the expansion. Blizzard put in quite a few tasters to get the people to come back early. I am not saying that Blizzard haven't done well to get the people back. They always do a few things before subs close for the quarter. I am just saying that you shouldn't expect another million to suddenly start playing after WoD is released. In all likelihood, a lot of those players are in the 600k.</div></div><hr />

As others have mentioned, we've added facial customization options to the in-game barbershop, which will allow you to change additional appearance options for an in-game gold cost.<br />
<br />
With the old models looking as... old, as they did, there's always been some amount of interpretation that's going to happen from person to person as they fill in the quality-gaps, and add their own story and character to any of the looks. Where a squiggly blurry line might look like a scar to you, it might look like freckles to someone else. A furled brow is grease smudge, a wince is a grimace, or a smile is a pout. We went into the archives, back to the source material and textures, and spent a lot of time trying to ensure we were interpreting all those squiggles and smudges in a way that is as true to the originals as possible, while also updating them to much higher resolutions and levels of fidelity. No easy task, I assure you. We expect that some will have had different interpretations of those old blurry textures than the ones we arrived at, and that's why we brought some of the recustomization features in-game for &quot;free&quot; (small gold cost like other barbershop features), and with that you can hopefully find new combinations and options that do appeal to you.<br />
<br />
Gee thanks for adding those customization options to the barber. what do you think would have happened had you NOT done that? How much more RAGE, and people are raging, would you have seen. Many threads are getting deleted about the models on the official forums.<br />
are they on !@#$ing crack? the new female human faces look NOTHING like the originals. How do you think changing eye colors from face to face is keeping the old feel? Freckles are CLEARLY visible on one of the old female human faces. CLEARLY, yet the remade version doesn't have them. ALL the eyebrows are WAY too high still. No one cares but I was going to resub for warlords, now, since the faces look the way they do and from what i have been reading about the class changes, I'm not so sure.</div></div><hr />

I figured it was pretty obvious. That despite the fact they announce they have 7.4 million subscribers worldwide, since the servers are region locked (NA, EU, China, etc) it doesn't actually matter that that is how many subscribers they have worldwide, because you can only play with the amount in your specific region, which is like maybe 25% of that total number.<br />

Because their shareholders are comprised of &quot;the public&quot;. Hence the term &quot;going public&quot; when a company starts being &quot;publicly&quot; traded on a major stock exchange.

As others have mentioned, we've added facial customization options to the in-game barbershop, which will allow you to change additional appearance options for an in-game gold cost.<br />
<br />
With the old models looking as... old, as they did, there's always been some amount of interpretation that's going to happen from person to person as they fill in the quality-gaps, and add their own story and character to any of the looks. Where a squiggly blurry line might look like a scar to you, it might look like freckles to someone else. A furled brow is grease smudge, a wince is a grimace, or a smile is a pout. We went into the archives, back to the source material and textures, and spent a lot of time trying to ensure we were interpreting all those squiggles and smudges in a way that is as true to the originals as possible, while also updating them to much higher resolutions and levels of fidelity. No easy task, I assure you. We expect that some will have had different interpretations of those old blurry textures than the ones we arrived at, and that's why we brought some of the recustomization features in-game for &quot;free&quot; (small gold cost like other barbershop features), and with that you can hopefully find new combinations and options that do appeal to you.<br />
<br />
Gee thanks for adding those customization options to the barber. what do you think would have happened had you NOT done that? How much more RAGE, and people are raging, would you have seen. Many threads are getting deleted about the models on the official forums.<br />
are they on !@#$ing crack? the new female human faces look NOTHING like the originals. How do you think changing eye colors from face to face is keeping the old feel? Freckles are CLEARLY visible on one of the old female human faces. CLEARLY, yet the remade version doesn't have them. ALL the eyebrows are WAY too high still. No one cares but I was going to resub for warlords, now, since the faces look the way they do and from what i have been reading about the class changes, I'm not so sure.<br />
<br />
Erm, just deactivate the new models in the settings then? I mean if you actually hate it so much ;) There is a special setting for that. No need to turn the overall quality down like they said initially.</div></div><hr />

Christ sake 600,000 subs for nothing is a freaking amazement.<br />
<br />
That's what I said. Blizzard announced MoP getting merged with the rest of WoW the same day the patch got released. I know this already.<br />
<br />
Also, what the heck are you talking about? I just said it was good to see people coming back to the game. You know, being positive and all that. You should try it sometime.<br />
<br />

<br />
Why release them to the public at all then? If they are just to please their shareholders.<br />
<br />
Do you even know what a shareholder is? If you invest in the company, you are a shareholder. Blizzard is obligated to produce these numbers to the public, since there are people in the public sector who are shareholders in the company. Heck, it's not out of the question that there are people on MMO-Champion who are shareholders in Activision Blizzard, so it is relevant to post the numbers here as well.</div></div><hr />

Actually what you experience might be that your taste is different to the taste of the masses...thats fine - it just isnt a Topic of good/bad Quality.<br />

<br />
Im sorry to blow your mind but WoW is a decade old game... its &quot;old generation&quot; game.<br />
<br />
Look at ESO, SWTOR and all those known mmos made out of very famous games or universes.... all of them failed to beat WoW while being very popular.<br />
So much for your theory about &quot;this generation&quot; thinking that popular means good quality. <br />
<br />
If you were right, swtor would be the highest subscribed mmo right now.</div></div><hr />

They both of them have terrible in game transition. Alliance Bike looks like spider butt sticking out. and the horde bike looks like a snowmobile because it too narrow. But, what you gonna do can't really complain it's free for the horde. Though if was alliance you can tell them to add more bloom to it make the metal stick out more since you guys have to pay for your's!</div></div><hr />

I have played it for long enough to know what WoW is, thus have an informed opinion.</div></div><hr />
