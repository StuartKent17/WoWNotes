<br />
<br />
It increases your damage done and taken by 5%, stacks up to 10 times. The thing is that in an arena, if the dpss are targetting you, you will receive an insane amount of damage, so it could be more harmful than beneficial if it &quot;lasts forever&quot;, but actually if you make a macro for canceling Death Wish's aura, it shouldn't supose a problem, and it would be a buff rather than a nerf, but actually it doesn't change anything. It is not a very common talent and is very little used as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

The second you get two stacks, the dps will just focus you so you will literally spend the rest of the match with two talents instead of three. It's wasn't used much over 2k at all, for a good reason. It simply wasn't as good as people think it was. And in most cases you would need to have disarm/spell reflect.</div></div><hr />

This has to be a joke, right? If not, why is this a thing? Nerf warriors weekly, but don't do anything about DH or Boomy being god-tier.</div></div><hr />
