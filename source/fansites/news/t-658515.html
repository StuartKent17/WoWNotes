PTR Patch 3.2 - Build 10147<br />
Another minor build, the live release is definitely getting closer. <br />
<br />
TCG Mounts Changes<br />
As I posted earlier this week, it seems that the Trading Card Mounts Bind on Pickup Removal (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=81285.0) is intended, all the spells used by the server to &quot;create&quot; the mounts in the player inventory have been changed and now point to new items.<br />
<br />
This is probably to end all the scams going on with these mounts. I guess you will just get one mount for each code now, and will be able to use it or sell it at the auction house if you want to. <br />

Holy<br />
Exorcism (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48801/) now deals damage to any enemy target instead of non-player enemy targets only. <br />
<br />
PTR Raid and Dungeon Testing (July 25)<br />
Here's the current schedule for Trial of the Crusader PTR testing:<br />
<br />
On the European test realms:<br />
<br />
Faction Champions – Monday Night, July 25, starting at 19:00 CEST. Normal and Heroic.<br />
<br />
Some of the tests will have multiple bosses and difficulties available for testing, as noted above.<br />
<br />
We’re going to try and have Test Patchwerks (Tank and DPS versions) available in the Argent Coliseum for testing. Instead of the previous tank test patchwerk that increased melee damage over time, the 3.2 tank test patchwerk will just hit VERY hard (as hard as Algalon) all the time to allow for more lengthy sustained tank parses. We're always interested in seeing combat logs and parses for all raid testing on the PTR, but especially test patchwerk logs. These are extremely helpful to our class team.<br />
<br />
This schedule could change at a moment's notice due to server, bug, or patch status. I'll try to keep everyone informed as much as possible. The Trial of the Crusader and the bosses to be tested will remain also open a variable length of time. How long they stay open depends upon a host of factors including designer availability, bug status, etc. These bosses are very much a work in progress, and this is a test server.<br />
<br />
Second part of Patch 3.2 available on Background Downloader<br />
Another part of the patch is available on the background downloader, make sure you launch it to download as much as possible before the live release of the patch!<br />

I'm going to spend a few hundred gold and take a chance. I have both the Spectral Tiger and Magic Rooster on live, so why not. But I'm guessing the answer is going to be no.</div></div><hr />

I have all of them but the turtle (which is still going to be bop for some reason?). What's really interesting is that the spectral isn't even unique... meaning if you knew for sure they would become boe, you could make a killing by buying as many as you could carry. <br />
<br />
I've already bought a few of the mounts on a just-in-case basis, and I'm going to DL the PTR and do a character copy to see what that does.</div></div><hr />

I'll answer it for you. If you buy a few and do a character copy, they become BoE. I'm guessing this will get changed before live, but I'm with you. I'm going to sink a few hundred gold and buy a few and see what happens. If I knew for sure, I've got a ton of money sitting in my guild bank that I could use to literally fill up a tab or two of my guild bank with mounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the previous build they were BoE when I copied my character, just updated to the latest build, and the couple Spectrals I had in my bank are all now soulbound and unique again on the ptr. So not sure whats gonna happen at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same what i was thinkin lol<br />
<br />
Plus: first every1 thinks unholys gonna be nerfed, but the dmg bonus we lose on SS, we win dps on BS(+50%/desease) or the 15% bonus dmg for deseases and the fact that UB will fusion into DC(=cost no runic power at all?!) Thats a buff imo and unholy dks gonna do more dps.<br />
When i first saw the 50% bonus after each deseases on BS i was sure they not gonna leave it like that, i just cant understand blizzard, why coming up with the idea, every1 can calculate and see thats too much! Then i was already laughing when reduced to 25%, and fell off my chair laughing now that its the same as before.<br />
Grats Blizzard again, u might want us to run after the bait u show but we already know whats behind...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is probably to end all the scams going on with these mounts. I guess you will just get one mount for each code now, and will be able to use it or sell it at the auction house if you want to.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good indeed. Makes trading them a lot less painful.<br />
Though, you'd still be able to sell them for game gold, but no longer able to scam people for game gold.<br />
<br />
You can still get scammed if you try to pay actual money for these though.</div></div><hr />

There is actually a huge difference. Buying gold directly from Blizzard for real money would mean adding gold to the server's economy that isn't already there. Buying mounts paid for with real money for in game gold just transfers gold already in the server's economy to a different player. The line between those gold sellers and this mount selling is a little less clear, however, to my knowledge those farmers/sellers don't spend their gold, so until it is sold to a player, it is not actually affecting the server's economy.<br />
<br />
Also, isn't this patch coming really soon after 3.1 or have I just lost perspective since I haven't really played too much since the first week of 3.1?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's how economy and markets works. After this change, their real-world (eBay or whatever) price will be adjusted to their in-game price. And vice versa. If they are indeed worth hundreds of dollars, then they will be worth a lot on the AH - most likely the exact equivalent of gold you get from hundreds of dollar from a gold seller.<br />
<br />
Whether this means their eBay price will go down, or remain stable while they start costing huge amounts on the AH remains to see.<br />
<br />
I do agree however, that gold buying is retarded, but apparently there are a lot of people (&quot;retarded&quot; or not) willing to pay real dollars for in-game gold. Otherwise there wouldn't be gold sellers making profits.<br />
<br />
<br />

gold is easy to come by but trying to find someone to buy a mount would take awhile :/<br />

5$ = 1000g<br />
<br />
the turtle mount would be ~40k gold<br />

rocket mount would be ~100k gold<br />

spectral tiger would be ~200k gold<br />

<br />
Never is a strong word. Blizzard can do whatever they want. People will continue on buying gold, there are 11-13 million World of Warcraft players out there, so it's bound to happen. Why not turn this business into their favor? I can't see anything wrong with Blizzard opening their own service. (well, I do - but let's think in a large scale) Gold sellers will loose their customers = Blizzard will gain customers. Of course this will cause quite a problem for the game economics - but it could probably be fixed by some sort of a system (X amount of gold per month). But then again, they'll probably buy numerous of accounts and buy some more - anyway - It's just a game.</div></div><hr />

Though people seem to think that it will mean that the mounts are actually getting sold.<br />

I mean, how many of the people that scams with the code, are gonna sell the actual code or ingame item when it comes to it.<br />
<br />
Even if the seller have a real code or card.<br />
<br />

But hell, if it works to purchase a couple extras before the patch goes live, thus turning them BoE, I'm gonna look for a seller so I can get one myself :P</div></div><hr />

i myself have sold a few codes ingame because i know alot of people who cant get the codes,or whos mummys and daddys wont buy them cards lol so i get them,but i only sell them really cheap,just basically so i get something out of it myself, if i need gold i will just go grind it myself,i would never buy gold either,i see no point risking my account just to save abit of time grinding,<br />
<br />
but yeh, i get them to help people,but i suppose people could just buy the codes for the mounts and sell them for gold ingame but i think to be honest you would probally get more gold buying from goldsellers for the hundreds of pounds /dollars youll pay for a mount,<br />

as soon as i get a mount in pack (which i buy a few lol) im putting on my dr00d xD</div></div><hr />

My hunter has the rocket and my priest has the Battle Bear. I've also sold countless tabards in Trade chat as well for usually 800-1000 gold. I did my research before I did this and found a blue post that says that while Blizz doesn't support these transactions, they're perfectly legal in game. Mainly because you are trading an in-game object for in-game gold. Thats okay with Blizz. If you sell in-game items for real-world cash, thats not. If you sell real-world items for in game gold, thats not okay either. For instance, you can't sell the CARD for 1000 gold. But you can sell the code, which is in-game.<br />
<br />
The only thing I hope comes out of this is that somehow Blizzard allows us who have the rare mounts to transfer them to our other characters. Something that special shouldn't just be soulbound to one toon.</div></div><hr />

Then they would have to deal with taxes and stuff... If they (Blizzard) would want to get rid of goldsellers they would have by now. Also they would not put rings in the game for 8000G , mounts for 20k+ G unless they had some interest. Theres simply no reason to do that , other than making sure people buy Gold.<br />

Note: Im sure there are lots of people that have bought insanely expensive stuff with money they made legit, but a lot of people have bought gold to buy them.</div></div><hr />

I agree. While for me to want to make a purchase that big for this game my salary would have to be very high (in the millions probably), different people have different priorities. Many people buy huge flat screen TVs. Who is to say that that would bring more enjoyment than a spectral tiger to someone? I doubt that some guy who just bought a 65&quot; HDTV with a surround sound system for thousands of dollars gets told &quot;you should shoot yourself with a large caliber gun for spending that much money on entertainment.&quot; It's just more socially acceptable to spend a lot of money on physical things like TVs, stereos, and computers than it is to spend it on virtual items.</div></div><hr />

According the NCP group as of march WoLK was still the best selling game in the US. In it's quarterly filing with the SEC MMORPG revenue inceased 30% over last year driven mainly by a increase in, wait for it,subscriptions. All this is if you don't believe their own press saying that the had currenctly had 11.5million subscribers as of dec '08. It's one of the best selling games there is, and THE best selling MMORPG. It's one numerous awards and tons of people love the game. I encourage you to stay, but if you don't, somehow we'll survive</div></div><hr />

Also, while I'd love for all of my characters to have full access to the codes and have bind on account mounts for all.... with the way you can switch characters from account to account, you'd have to put in some sort of safety feature that disables all codes during the switch, or you'd just have people trading a &quot;mount mule&quot; all around to different accounts.

And yes, 12 million people still do play. WotLK was the best selling mmo there is. Just because your quitting and there is other nostalgics who cant beat half the hardmodes and always come up with a bullshit excuse such as &quot;im posting on my alt&quot; make 3 threads each about how they think blizzard are ruining the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fact is, blizzard is not going to spend months designing amazing content that only 1%, LESS than 1%, of the population of wow will ever actually see. in bc everyone except the top 1% were quitting because you basically had to quit your job and spend most of your time playing wow to win at the game. In pre bc, more in early pre bc same thing. Pre bc was much worse and dont try to hide the fact that blizzard loved some classes and were ready to delete others. Remember when at the same time rogues were owning everyine in pvp while naked, paladins were getting nerfed more and more every patch, even with their class review untill they could do nothing but pve heal, and they werent very good at that either. <br />
<br />
Blizzard is definately improving the game and yes, they are catering for casuals. They'd rather have 20000 people quit than 10 million people quit. Blizzard started catering for casuals in 3.0, they are catering for casuals in 3.2, and in 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, as long as wow exists, they are going to cater for the majority of wow players. <br />
<br />
Either get the heard modes or GTFO. No one wants to hear your constant whining.</div></div><hr />

Spectral tiger TCG loot card - 1300-2500 dollars<br />

Do people actually buy those on Ebay?<br />

I think the Ebay value is artificially inflated from continuous buying and reselling by people looking to make a buck on its obvious rarity. But nobody with $1300 to blow is going to spend it on a few purple pixels and a 2-inch e-peen extension.</div></div><hr />
