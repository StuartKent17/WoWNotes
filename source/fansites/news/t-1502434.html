That's not the only way they can go:<br />
<br />
Outcast Dreamcatcher - Outcast Arakkoa have repurposed the dreamcatcher not to ward off the Curse of Sethe, but to capture and harvest tiny amounts of essences from their lost gods. Rumors persist of an ever-growing mass of swirling energy buried deep beneath Skettis, whispering promises of power to any who will listen...<br />
<br />
Basically they can go one of two ways with the Arakkoa raid-- the Apexis or the Old God under Skettis.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">furydeath</div><div class="date">2014-04-22, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Troll raid right next to the dance studio :cool:</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellrod</div><div class="date">2014-04-22, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Set looks great!! Idc what anyone says and complains about WoD having too much gritty gear, the Iron Stars in the shoulderplates effect looks badass. The whole set is pretty cool and the Iron Horde approach to it looks very warrior-appropriate so you can't really complain there. So far each piece of gear looks class-appropriate, but i'll wonder what they'll do for druids. I bet the shaman tier would be inspired by Ner'zhul since he and his shadowmoon clan are some of the biggest shamans around. Basically, i imagine an orcish shaman approach apart from a draenei one.<br />
<br />
also, that mail set looks VERY NICE! Very sleek and simplistic, but charming in that streamlined sort of way. i love the color choice, and although it says mail, it'd be really cool if that was cloth for mages and warlocks. But i can see the &quot;ranger&quot; or &quot;scout&quot; look they were going for that would look good on hunters.<br />
<br />
Also, I like how people are assuming that &quot;Troll Raid&quot; refers to a Zandalari raid when it's listed under Battlegrounds in the datafiles. It's probably a troll-themed BG, perhaps involving some sort of raid-like event, or just a joke blizz is playing on dataminers like they did with &quot;Medhiv's Big Birthday Bash&quot; at Karazhan.</div></div><hr />

Oh please no, the Arakkoa should not worship the old gods at this point, they only started the worship of the lorebreaking draenor old god after Auchindoun blew up, and that's a small subsection of Arakkoa . And the old god was a last ditch effort. I mean there are threeish major factions of Arakkoa not including the mysterious Apexis, the Sethekk who worship the old god, Talon King Ikiss, and the &quot;dark-fire&quot;, the Skettis which worship their traditional gods, Terokk and Rukhmar and lastly the light worshiping Skettis Exiles, who converted when the Naaru showed their face. The issue with Arakkoa lore is that it's really, really poorly fleshed out. Terokk might be Rukhmar, Anzu is apparently a god that doesn't fit in with Terokk/Rukhmar, Darkfire is literally never explained, Naaru were involved before the Skettis Exiles converted, what happened to Apexis and random old god that doesn't relate to any other lore on Draenor.</div></div><hr />

Terokk might be Rukhmar, Anzu is apparently a god that doesn't fit in with Terokk/Rukhmar, Darkfire is literally never explained, Naaru were involved before the Skettis Exiles converted, what happened to Apexis and random old god that doesn't relate to any other lore on Draenor.<br />
<br />
Screenshots from the Spires 5-man give us reason to believe that Rukhmar is an Old God, and the Curse of Sethe(kk)'s namesake could easily be another. It seems like the WoD arakkoa are basically caught in the middle of a war between Old Gods.<br />

Agreed, but I wouldn't be surprised to see another warrior set look a lot more like t4 and have it be labeled as pvp gear, then have the armor sets switch once live hits. <br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, that's just me hoping that they redo the set to look more like t4 and save this set for t18 which looks more akin to t5 than anything. And hey, this is still alpha, for all anyone knows, this could end up being the death knight armor once the screws have been tightened a little more (...or perhaps this is CM gold gear).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's cool, sounds amazing. My point is why the hell did they do the same thing every time and buff casters and keep the mele where they are or even nerf some mele specs. Do you honestly think mele are doing so much more damage than casters so these changes were needed? They're pretty much setting the baseline where casters do more and mele do less and will probably make some changes after that if they ever feel like it. In WOTLK, Cata and MOP they never felt like balancing down caster dps so what makes you think they will do it in WOD? <br />
<br />
Edit: Guess it should be &quot;you&quot; instead of &quot;they&quot; i guess.</div></div><hr />

Mail set... I kinda like that one aswell. Doesn't look that good on human male, but the set looks unique and isn't &quot;groteque&quot; as many of the hunter sets are(which I honestly hate). I don't know if this is intended for hunters, or if it doesn't matter, but it does look more hunter than anything else. Might just be green quality mail though.

And had they gone the lazy route and rehashed then people whould have cried rivers of tears and the bitching and moaning would have been impossible to bear.<br />
Aside from that it looks much much better than tier 4,5 and 6 combined.<br />

<br />
You should probably never read, nor post in topics about an ALPHA.. You have no idea how gameplay is in the alpha. The live game is balanced within 3% of each other in specs throughout a tier. It is very probable that specs are off by as much as 50% in the alpha. They did a very course correction just so they can do stuff like test 5 man encounters without the rogue being able to solo him. It is hard to test mechanisms if dps if so imbalanced. Right now, go take your level 90 and try to solo a Cata normal dungeon and tell me if think a dev could test mechanisms or balance encounters based on your combat logs.<br />
<br />
The adjustments you are seeing are from ONE ALPHA build to another ALPHA build.. they are not from live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am aware that those adjustments are on alpha build and not live and lol at specs being 3% of each other. <br />
My point is that casters have been the top dps since wotlk and now what we see in WOD alpha is nerfs to mele and buffs to casters again.<br />
<br />
Guess we will just wait and see but it doesn't seem like they want any change on the dps situation, what was overpowered for the last several years will stay overpowered, just watch. Like I said history repeats itself every expansion. Do you remember any period of time in the past where Mage/Warlocks have not been the top dps? Well they are buffing them in the very first alpha corrections in the upcoming WOD so yeah, nothing new so far.</div></div><hr />

Very nice looking Warrior set. It seems like the art team are going ham up in this bitch for this expansion.</div></div><hr />

About time. It's so not fun to play against a rogue as a shadow. I guess you can have 50ilvl more and you still got no chance at all.</div></div><hr />

I've never been overly fond of any warrior tier. This is one I'd not want to transmog out of. As for Troll Raid, I was REALLY hoping we'd be done with trolls for a while... seeing as we've pretty much wiped out the last of the hostile tribes in ToT. I grow weary of seeing troll based encounters appearing in every expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mykro9</div><div class="date">2014-04-22, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am aware that those adjustments are on alpha build and not live and lol at specs being 3% of each other. <br />
My point is that casters have been the top dps since wotlk and now what we see in WOD alpha is nerfs to mele and buffs to casters again.<br />
<br />
Guess we will just wait and see but it doesn't seem like they want any change on the dps situation, what was overpowered for the last several years will stay overpowered, just watch. Like I said history repeats itself every expansion. Do you remember any period of time in the past where Mage/Warlocks have not been the top dps? Well they are buffing them in the very first alpha corrections in the upcoming WOD so yeah, nothing new so far.<br />
<br />
As has been mentioned, you have NO idea what you are talking or complaining about. They did not take the numbers from MoP and copy/paste them into the WoD alpha, and then buff the casters. What you have no idea about is that mages and warlocks were probably doing WAY less damage than they should during their WoD ALPHA testing, and had to adjust the numbers to accommodate it. So, when mages and warlocks are doing 20% more damage than your rogue during WoD live, you can complain. Until then please STFU, and QFT.</div></div><hr />

About time? Have you only just started playing? Rogues have always been the underdogs and never get more than one line in patch notes ever since vanilla,and as for the shadow argument its bull,a rogue vs any other class is useless,healers dont die,mail wearers just run and get healed,cloth wearers just absorb everything,and dont get me started on druids,heal heal CC CC bear bear....all the while rogues are still trying to ramp up dps and combo points to do any sort of dmg.</div></div><hr />
