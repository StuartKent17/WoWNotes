::)<br />
It would be WAY better if the &quot;LET'S MAKE SPIRIT USEFUL!&quot;-train of thought would... extend to Shamans. Like... I dunno. &quot;Your Water Shield Charges give extra mana equal to 33/66/100% of your spirit&quot; or something. That would me make stack spirit, I guess... at least with Improved Water Shield and those crit talents. <br />
<br />
I mean, seriously... what makes me stack spirit now? Nothing, except the 5-second-rule... but with something like &quot;Critting a heal gives 500 mana instead of 230&quot;... count me in.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Seriously. They should add this to Improved Water Shield. It would make those Crit-Focused Resto-Builds all the more viable.</div></div><hr />

Pre-WOTLK? Sure. <br />
<br />
However, considering they are trying to make Spirit a useful stat for all classes (see Lifetap for Warlocks now scaling with Spirit), it seems that Paladins and Shamans are left in the cold - and Paladins can go for Crit, while Shamans only can with a very specific build. So it seems logical that both classes will - during the beta - gain some benefit from spirit - and neither class has a &quot;X% of your mana reg works during combat&quot; talent like Druids and Priests do. <br />
<br />
So, going for Illumination and Water Shield would be the logical way to do it, since those ARE the mana-reg talents of those classes.<br />
<br />
Though - who knows. Maybe Blizzard decides that spirit will stay a &quot;bad&quot; stat for those classes and not make any of those changes - then all mail and plate &quot;healing&quot; gear will have lots of MP5 instead of spirit. But considering that a multi-stat-item will pretty much always be more powerful (from an item budget point of view), I'm not sure it would be fair. We'll see. <br />
<br />
A lot depends on itemization - and considering they want to make as little loot &quot;rot&quot; as possible, making spirit - which is abundant on cloth and leather - a useful stat for Palas and Shamans which can equip those armor classes as a last resort, it would fall in line with Blizzard's current philosphy. Just like Leggings of Eternity, Guise of the Tidal Lurker and Kilt of Immortal Nature are options for Paladins and Shamans in BC as well - even though they're aimed at Druids and Priests.</div></div><hr />

There are quite a few &quot;Bracers / Belt / whatever of BOSSNAME&quot; in there, true. <br />
<br />
I don't think they will ever run out of names, though. I mean, if you prefer the naming-style of &quot;Handwraps of Flowing Thoughts&quot;, I'm sure there are a billion combinations of ITEM OF ADJECTIVE NOUN left. Maybe they're just going for a different naming style in Northrend - or maybe they're keeping this naming style for epics. See War Mace of Unrequited Love, for example. But who knows? I guess we'll have to see more items before we can start speculating.<br />
<br />
What bothers me more is the fact that there isn't a single set item to be found among the dungeon drops. I hope they didn't get rid of a &quot;blue dungeon set&quot; for WOTLK.</div></div><hr />

Which is why i'm considering making a Death Knight my new main. Blue has already said that since we're going to be sharing our(rogue) gear with other classes(feral druids/enhancement shamans) they'll be removing/lowering the amount of hit rating on gear since druids and shamans do not need as much as rogues.</div></div><hr />

DKP Bidding is great! Really good fun :D<br />

The only thing we really lose is identity in the loot.

<br />
Maybe not 30dps, but since raid gear focuses on damage output at the cost of survivability and arena gear has the opposite focus, the raid gear should have more raw dps than the arena gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quite possibly.<br />
I doubt much is set in stone yet, these are obviously place holder names. However, they will need a gear reset for resilience at lvl80, such that lvl80 blue gear from arena/battlegrounds/worldpvp will give the same amount of resilience as season 4. <br />
It's likely that this blue gear is intended for this reset, it could just be really cheap arena gear, so that people will be able to do arenas with their new deathknights at level80, and not be overwhelmed by people in season 4 gear.</div></div><hr />

I would assume that this dungeon loot would be integral in developing an entry level raiding set at 80, but there is no spell hit. Does this indicate a significant change in the importance of hit for caster classes in WOTLK? Or have the devs just not finalized item stats?<br />
<br />
Most casters now have a least 3% hit from talents in the new WOTLK talent trees plus 1% from Draenei with the expansion of buffs to the entire raid. So every caster in a raid will have 4% hit already. Is this the max needed?<br />

<br />
I think you're on to something here. Although, shadow priests have their +hit talent kinda reduced, from 10% for 5 talent points to 3% for 3 points. Thats ok though as shadow priests reached the hit cap so early at lvl70 you could take points out anyway.<br />
<br />
But still, most of the gear we've seen so far are blues, and are designed to be used by holy priests as much as mages. Remember - all spellpower now benefits healing! Please note the lack of MP5 on the cloth gear, theres plenty of spirit, though. Most probably, they'll only bring back +hit and MP5 in raids, as it's hit is useless for healers, and MP5 is less than brilliant for DPSers. Also, +hit can be socketed, and enchanted too.</div></div><hr />

There is no Spell Hit listed on any of the items. Interestingly melee gear listed does have a hit budget.<br />
<br />
I would assume that this dungeon loot would be integral in developing an entry level raiding set at 80, but there is no spell hit. Does this indicate a significant change in the importance of hit for caster classes in WOTLK? Or have the devs just not finalized item stats?<br />
<br />
Most casters now have a least 3% hit from talents in the new WOTLK talent trees plus 1% from Draenei with the expansion of buffs to the entire raid. So every caster in a raid will have 4% hit already. Is this the max needed?<br />
<br />
Very interesting stuff...<br />

I think this is partly to make raid stacking viable. Ie. you cant run without oomkin and ele shaman now as a caster group given that you would be losing 6% spell hit right there.</div></div><hr />

Actually in the new WOTLK talent trees, Totem of Wrath no longer grants a spell hit buff, only a 5% spell crit buff.<br />
<br />
Yet more evident of spell hit becoming less important.</div></div><hr />

There have been some tests on beta that showed that 0 hit = 16% miss. 9% hit was either an error or something they changed, currently it's the same mechanic as we have today.<br />
<br />
At the moment, the only +spell hit modifier is moonkin's Improved Faerie Fire for 3% (and Dranei presence). Casters will have to stack a certain amount of +hit, and this is largely reflected on a lot of the gear that you can see. Gear without hit or crit is mostly targetted at healers, even if it does look very alluring to casters too.</div></div><hr />
