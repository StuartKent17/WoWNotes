Talents 2.0<br />
<br />
Major change to class talent trees, and this is a new phase of development for the talent system.<br />
The goal is to have you sit to another next to another combat rogue, and this combat rogue will actually have different talents than you do!<br />
Character customization was the original point of talents in the first place but overtime cookie cutter builds dominated the scene. <br />
<br />
<br />
New Model<br />
<br />
Class Abilities are available to all specs in the class. All warriors learn heroic strike for example.<br />
Spec Abilities are available to certain specs. Only Arms warriors learn Slam. Retribution and Protection paladin get Hammer of the Righteous, etc ...<br />
Talents are optional skills/bonuses available to all specs. Any warrior can choose Throwdown, and you will have to pick between 3 different crowd control abilities on this level of talent.<br />
Level 15 - You pick your first talent. For example, warriors have to pick between Juggernaut / Double Time / Warbringer and players will have to pick which mobility ability they want to pick depending on their playstyle.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talent Philosophy<br />
<br />
Access to stuff you never could before. If you were a subtlety rogue you knew you weren't going to get something like Killing Spree. And because talents are going to be all in the same tree, you're going to be able to combine them in a way that you never could before. For example, any rogue can have Shadowstep!<br />
Several new, overpowered (feeling) talents will be added to the game. <br />
If you don't see a beloved talent in your new talents list, don't worry, it's probably something we gave your spec as a baseline. For example all Holy priests now have Circle of Healing.<br />
No mandatory talents anymore.<br />
Every choice should be hard but fun!<br />
<br />
<br />
Talent Preview<br />
<br />
Design will iterate a lot on individual talents<br />
Don't obsess about the numbers<br />

<br />
Ignorant. Utility decisions are not based on math, they are very scenario-based. Also makes it so you have to think about bringing more than one of a particular class, since 2 characters of the same class might have builds that give the raid unique buffs from each. You don't know what they are implementing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not what they mean by cookie cutter builds. True customization means you can pick what you want without consequences. There will be a varying degree of difference between two of the same class\spec. When they refer to cookie cutter, they mean the majority of one class\spec chooses the SAME talents because that's what optimal.<br />
<br />
All that is fine, except it's not true customization. It's choices for the sake of it, even though it doesn't really matter. As talents are now, you could just scrap the entire thing and GIVE people their talents as actual passive traits\abilities, and you get the same thing as what we're choosing at the moment.<br />
<br />
In an ideal game, a Rogue would have 50 options, but can only choose 25. So one chooses the first 25, one chooses the second 25 and both rogues, though different, are just as competitive. Thats what they're aiming for. Thats not cookie cutter. But when every rogue is choosing the first 25 b\c the second 25 aren't as good. That leads to cookie cutter.<br />
<br />
And you're right, it's not a big deal if thats what you want. Theres nothing wrong with that design by itself -- but obviously, thats the not design WoW wants. =)</div></div><hr />

Hmm so Juggernaut can charge in combat, but this makes it so you can charge twice as often but only out of combat? I guess that would be pretty cool for leveling or tanking if warbringer still exists.</div></div><hr />

I think the idea is that option A, B, and C will be more of a style choice than a numbers choice. I'd imagine that there won't be any pure dps talents. Or if there are, they will be easy to balance out. i.e. killing spree hits as hard as shadow dance which is the same as vendetta</div></div><hr />

Specs are not gone and a lot of the things that were previously available only to one spec will still be happening that way. You still chose a spec at level 10 and you gain spec-specific abilities in increments, but there aren't talent points or trees anymore so it's possible that people will be able to hybridize more.</div></div><hr />

As a WoW community, we have Trion to thank for showing up Blizzard on their talent strategy in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Prior to Cata, Morhaime was waxing philosophically about how cool Modern Warfare 3 skill unlocks were, and how talents were essentially too complicated. We thus got 3 talent trees, where the ability choices were minimal to the extent that every player was the same once they picked their role. <br />
<br />
Trion went the route of virtually unlimited choice... Blizz even chided Rift for being unbalanceable. Guess what? There's hardcore min/maxers in any game EVER -- wow, rift, world of tanks, pokemon...super mario brothers...pong. Trion left the community to police itself (tweaking abilities between patches, as a matter of course) and its worked out fine. Choice = risk, and I'd prefer playing a game where I can make choices and play the way I want.<br />
<br />
I'm glad Blizzard hasn't lost the ability to correct their mistakes. This new talent system looks much more promising!</div></div><hr />

There are no talent specs though if I'm reading it correctly. All classes just get 1 talent tree to choose from and from each tier I believe you choose just one of the talents. <br />
<br />
Not entirely sure of it myself. Will have to just wait and see what happens. Hopefully they'll pre-release the talents just before the new expansion comes out so get a proper look.</div></div><hr />

It's more like:Old talents -&gt; Base class abilities + Spec abilities + new talents. The old talents have been separated, if you want to compare it to the old trees it gives something like that: I can pick my frost mage dps and core talents which every frost mage picks anyway when I choose to be frost spec at lvl 10. (Those talents will be learned passively while leveling) + Even though I am a frost mage, I can pick between all the old gimmick talents from every mage spec + some new ones.

No, you still pick a spec, and you still gain abilities as you level in that SPEC (specs will have their own abilities, like the old talent system) you now ALSO get extra bonus epic abilities every 15 levels. <br />

They are survival talents. Just like Blessed Life is in Holy tree now. You just don't have the option of skilling survival talents now! They arent completely useless. Some will obviously be better for a healer than a tank. Blessed Life - good if you catch an add. Ardent Defender - &quot;oh no, I'm in fire&quot;. Sacred Shield - &quot;crap, I'm almost dead.... Shield!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of the entire tiers are totally and utterly worthless for certain specs. With only 6 awailable talents.... thats just horrendously bad design. <br />
<br />
IN PVE <br />
If you play a tank - every talent should improve you as a tank <br />
If you play healer - every talent shold improve you as a healer <br />
If you play DPS - every talent should improve you as dps <br />
<br />
<br />
These are the 3 basic roles that BLizzard THEMSELFS have created and they are creating a talent system that forces a healer to take tank talent ? Thats 1 of 6 talents point gone for noting. THAT IS POINTLESS talent. <br />
<br />
Some of the tiers are designed around PVP only and thats even more horrible. <br />

Yeah cuz a 15% dmg reduction with Aspect of the Hawk and increased focus generation from Arcane Arrows is awful. -_- Should actually look at the talents before you speak. You're also looking at something to make the same class more unique. This isn't a balance change so shush.</div></div><hr />

Sorry I should have said I was mainly talking about PvE, I read every single talent from multiple classes. Arcane Arrows is nice and all, we'll just see how it plays out in the end, since we won't have T13 2pc to work with either. Myself and others have given multiple options to improve Hunter specs on the WoW forums, yet we're ignored, now we hardly get much of anything in the next expac? sounds like they listen to feedback amazingly well.</div></div><hr />

You're also looking at something to make the same class more unique. This isn't a balance change so shush. 15% dmg reduction for hawk is good only for pve. Pvp sure it might have some uses, but if you get stunned in fox its gg no re, no benefit at all. In pve its 15% less damge taken which is nice but if you remember, hunter has no damage reduction cooldown meaning other classes will probably still take less damage than hunters do. Arcane arrows IS awful...its nothing else than bullshit rng talent... 5 focus with 50% CHANCE avarages on 2.5 focus per shot... thats INCREDIBLY interesting and powerfull talent...my ass. With current design for ranged weapons with 3.0 speed and nearly no haste on pvp gear it comes down to 2.5 focus/3 sec. POWERFULL SHIT RIGHT THERE In pve i belive poison thingy will be more powerfull and for pvp everything is equally worthless. Frozen ones are shit if concussive shot still exists Poison ones are shit cause they will break trap unless blizz finally make it ignore dots arcane ones is just shit... If it would be 5 focus on each shot then we can talk about somewhat decent talent</div></div><hr />

Another one that doesn't understand the complaint at all. Even if you still get all the stuff you used to have.

This system is perfect.<br />

And now... Don't get deceived people, cookie cutter builds will still exist (as long as talents have a relation of any sort to dealing damage, tanking or healing), they're only making the system less punitive to those who choose their talents without putting much thinking into it. sooo full of fail</div></div><hr />

These talent systems are a joke. You would have 0 uniqueness or differentiation between players of a certain spec. At least right now there is some difference. They need to re-complicate the talent trees and make them more diverse and interesting so we actually see multiple builds of a spec ... instead of this mockery. If they implement these talent ideas they may as well just start selling the game to 3 year olds. Such a joke. I'm waiting for the troll face to appear. This is going to be the expansion that breaks blizzard if they simplify the game any further.</div></div><hr />

Maybe people should understand that MOST of the raiding community just copies off the top1% anyway. These new talents spice things up quite a bit and it is making me more excited then any other aspect currently proposed?Pandas? lawl.. Notice some abilities have half duration and such for pve and pvp. This is a positive change for both pve and especially pvp where we will likely see more varied builds despite no game being truely immune to cookie cutter type postulation from websites and such.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This system is nothing like Rift's and you should feel bad for even suggesting that. Rift's system is pretty much infinitely customizable: choose 3 of 8 trees, spend points however you want in these trees, get free spec abilities simply for having put X points into each tree. In WoW's system, you basically make a total of 7 choices: 1 of 3 talents every 15 levels, and 1 of 3 specializations at the beginning. This system is FAR less customizable than the 4.0 system, and both of them are much less customizable than the original system. Each class literally has 49 configurations now, compared to literally billions in the beginning. WoW's system might be on par with Rift's if they built onto it instead of revamping it every expansion, but now it just sucks.<br />
<br />
Not to mention: dual spec. Rift has 5 specs.</div></div><hr />

They think that dumbing down talents even more is going to prevent cookie cutter builds. Trust me there will be a set of raiding optimized talents moments after the final list is released and everyone will be checking Elitist Jerks to find out what they need to compete dps/hps wise. <br />

Could you elaborate on the choice you have in the current system? How many abilities, on average, would you say you have different compared to another person of the same spec as you?<br />

Not saying the current system gives great choices, but at least the talents I pick actually affect my play-style. Yes, being &quot;forced&quot; into easy choices is bad, but having the choice being completely inconsequential is in no way any more interesting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leviatharan</div><div class="date">2011-10-21, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMG DK STUFF, GIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMME... <br />
First, most general thing I notice: Tier 1 is disease spreading, T2 is survival, T3 is PvP, T4 is healing, T5 is rune regen and T6 bears all of the *actually interesting* AoE abilities... So for a PvE DPS like me, only three of these tiers are actually worth something (1, 5, 6). But hey, I see the applications of the others for the two other major DK builds, and you have to remember that you come out of the starting zone with the first three tiers filled up and the fourth right around the corner... But this is all before you get to the CONTENTS of the tier, which actually make things interesting: <br />
T1. It's a tie between this and T4 for what I would call my hardest choice. If forced to a vote I'd grab Outbreak just because I'm so USED to it, though I certainly think Corpse Explosion has made an interesting comeback. Roiling Blood is superior for AoE though- if only because its not dependent on having already filled the room with corpses, though it DOES let me get to my AoE a lot faster...<br />
T2. If they don't fix AMZ's scaling- I don't care if they've removed the costs and removed Bone Shield's 2% damage increase- I'm not taking it. I'd rather have an ability I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO USE rather than an ability I WILL NEVER END UP USING. <br />
T3. Thing I have to wonder is why any DK would pick any talent other than Asphyxiate, if it's an infinite stun. (Yes, I know, it'll absolutely change from &quot;until cancelled&quot; to something lame like 5 sec, I'm just being facetious.) But if they made Asphyxiate something like an Incapacitate and turned it into the go-to DK Crowd Control, I'd be all over that in PvE. Otherwise, it's all PvP stuff, which only has an effect on your T6 choice. <br />
T4. Like I said before, hard choice here, especially considering I'm running Unholy. Death Siphon combines so well with Dreadblade and Ebon Plaguebringer, while Death Pact is extremely convenient since it no longer eats the ghoul! I have to wonder though if there will be a glyph or talent to make Death Siphon inflict Shadowfrost damage, just so Frost might take a swing at it. <br />
T5. Not sure about T5 honestly. I'm almost positive nobody will take Runic Empowerment just due to the sheer number of complaints about Rune Tetris and the Whack-a-mole system. Blood Tap looks interesting and fun, but I think I'll keep Runic Corruption as my top pick just due to the advantage of HASTE at high levels. <br />
T6. Remorseless Winter: Frost version of the original Unholy Blight. Instead of a fourth disease, it's a stun- QQ more, melee PvPers! Depending on what you chose in T3, this might be the favorite for PvP (if you got Chillblains this'll be redundant, but anything else...); Gorefiend's Grasp: AoE Death Grip with Shadow damage. Somehow I'm seeing a repeat of Strangulate and Pestilence on the horizon just from that &quot;with Shadow damage&quot;, but it should definitely kill any complaints about Blood's lack of AoE threat, considering they'll hold EVERYTHING IN 20 YARDS if they execute it right; Desecrated Ground: Death and Decay on CRACK. I swear, if they give us Defile after adding THIS thing, my head will explode just due to the sheer redundancy of it all... but I'll still take this in my Unholy spec over anything else. <br />
<br />
All in all, it's good to see that they're using a more Diablo-esque talent system and emphasizing player choices rather than cookie-cutter builds. I'd just like to see what they mean by &quot;specialization&quot; though- It does have those passive and spec-specific talents we know and love, right? Where are my Dark Transformation and Summon Gargoyle? Better not have lost DT for Corpse Explosion, or I'ma be PISSED...</div></div><hr />

mheh I dunno, the warlock T6 ones for instance depend a lot on the type of fight, what you need to do and possibly howw you like to play. It's still not ideal but a lot more flexible than what we have now.<br />

Also makes it so you have to think about bringing more than one of a particular class, since 2 characters of the same class might have builds that give the raid unique buffs from each. You don't know what they are implementing.<br />
That means the &quot;cookie cutter&quot; builds will be scenario-based rather than generic to an entire tier. It doesn't mean there won't be cookie cutter builds.<br />

I'm a fan of the new system, but Blizzard cannot stop cookie cutter builds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lets look at warlocks for a sec right now. Lets say on boss X affliction tops dps, in that spec there are 3 optional talents but depending the fight it's probably even less.<br />
<br />
So in reality the warlock class has 1 or 2 possible configs right now for that situation. And in wotlk, tbc or vanilla it was one. Yes you had billions of way to be a moron, that's true. If this system brings the amount of options from 1-2 to 6 than yay. And it will do that if they remove eg dmg increasing talents.<br />
<br />
( same goes for rift btw, there is a specific best config. you just have a lot of ways to fail which no decent player will do anyway cause you look up whatever the best thing is.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct, but thats the point. Each tier is supposed to make you choose between talents with a similar theme - cc, damage reduction, interrupts - but they do it in different ways so you pick the one you think suits how you play best. Even in your example, they all provide healing, but one is just a temp health boost, one is a relatively low healing attack with no cd, and the other a larger healing boost with a cd. While vampiric blood is obviously a tank cooldown (which makes me think they may change that) you could take it as frost for pvp now. Or you could take death siphon as a tank for an on demand small heal (depending on if they tweaked the numbers).<br />
<br />
Dont forget these are all subject to change at the moment too, they're more for an idea of what to expect.</div></div><hr />

lvl 15: <br />
- feline swiftness: run 10% faster ? no tnx <br />
- tireless pursiut: we can achieve the same effect now with /cast cat form /cast dash<br />
- displacer beast: a blink on a 3 min cd and that put us in cat form ? no tnx<br />
<br />
lvl 30:<br />
- cenarion ward: short cooldown, hope the healing effect scales with spell power and the number is not final<br />
- renewal: 30% heal every 2 min means 0.25% health every sec - we lose much more health than that every sec right now<br />
- nature swiftness: allow for an instant cyclone every......3 minutes :| or an instant healing touch with +50% effect, the cooldown is too long<br />
none of those can be compared to soul leech and harvest for life (25% of direct damage converted into health and 6% health over 3 sec drained from every target around you, no cooldown - on a different row they also have spell drain on a 20sec cd...)<br />
<br />
lvl 45:<br />
- faerie swarm: finally a slow that can be spammed, too bad that every other class can do this while dealing damage...<br />
- mass entaglement: frost nova on a 60 second cooldown mages have it on a 25sec cooldown<br />
- typhoon: our old bugged typhoon<br />
too bad that we can have only one of them while mages and shamans have all of them<br />
<br />
lvl 60:<br />
- wild charge, usefull to escape it coupled with typhoon i assume bound backward means jump backward<br />
- incarnation: there's no superior form for moonkin form if there was this would be our &quot;burst cooldown&quot; we have asked for a while<br />
- force of nature: they deal damage / heal / tank depending on the spec<br />
too bad that one more time we have to choose only one of them, lose our force of nature (and considering the damage it does right now is not a big loss) to have a pvp &quot;escape&quot; cooldown (we still don't know if there's a cooldown, in which case it would be like any our ability with a huge cd)<br />
or a urst cooldown (every other spec has both an escape ability and a burst one)<br />
<br />
lvl 75:<br />
- demoralizing roar: nice it has 30 sec cooldown, but we can't go anywhere nor heal any decent amount in 4 sec? (2.5 because there's the GCD)<br />
- ursol's vortex: what's the point in pulling someone that is 15y near you on TOWARD your location? we need create distance from melees, not pull them on us...<br />
- bear hug: a 3 sec stun....on a 60 sec cooldown that decrease in potency as we lose health<br />
<br />
lvl 90:<br />
- hearth of wild: finally a way to precharge an eclipse......on a SIX minutes cooldown ???? and this &quot;powerful cooldown&quot; (it has to be powerful to be on a 6 min CD, right? ) ask us to attack with cat form if we are caster and attack with spells if we are cat.<br />
I can understand a feral attacking with spells, but if i go in melee range then i'm f**d up because i need once again to create a gap from the melee attacking me.....<br />
- master shapeshifter: same !@#$ as before if we are caster we need to spend a gcd to enter car form and benefit from the &quot;buff&quot; then find a way to escape from melee range<br />
- disentaglement: an usefull heal every 20sec if paired with renewal or maybe cenarion ward too bad we can no longer pre charge eclipse...<br />
<br />
<br />
worst thing of all ? not only those talents sucks for balance druids and make use choose only one of 3 buff every row when every other caster has them baseline, make us change from moonkin form (and loose the -15% dmg) because we are being forced into cat form, but they also gives nothing to resto druids except a very poor heal every 10 sec (cenarion ward)</div></div><hr />

You get a few special abilities for picking your baseline path (Sub/Combat/Assass for example), then every multiple of 15 you get a choice to make?<br />
<br />
So every character will basically be a carbon copy of each other, besides 8-9 things? IDK if I like the sound of that.<br />
<br />
Or is it &quot;You can pick your talents as you go but every multiple of 15 you get a choice&quot;??<br />
<br />
#2 would be okay, but sounds more like #1 to me.</div></div><hr />

How do you see priests being amazing every tier has the same talents we have now except that you can choose power infusion, some corny light ball, and the final tier is just a share damage thingie. <br />
<br />
i'm concerned about pvp here, none of that seems to match the rogue op'd changes, or the warlocks. and can that work against frost mages? gotta wait and see for the core specs to be sure.<br />

<br />
From what i've seen, druids are going to be a strong support class in pvp, and players will have to learn shift-swapping to the extreme to maximum usefulness. <br />
<br />
Although from the talents provided, these changes are very dangerous.<br />
<br />
Also note, that i imagine druids will be sharing gear with monks on a agi/int platform allowing forms to be viable given the situation.<br />
<br />
Just a guess assuming the agi/int platform is true from heresay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
worst thing of all ? not only those talents sucks for balance druids and make use choose only one of 3 buff every row when every other caster has them baseline, make us change from moonkin form (and loose the -15% dmg) because we are being forced into cat form, but they also gives nothing to resto druids except a very poor heal every 10 sec (cenarion ward)<br />
<br />
<br />
Talents aren't set in stone yet.<br />
<br />
Bolded, underlined, increased text size and put in italics so you don't miss it this time...<br />
<br />
If you look at talents like Incarnation it says Example: in the tooltip, these are certainly not the final talents.<br />
<br />
And from what I've seen the druid talents are looking to be pretty awesome, highly based on utility (tank dies, need to pick up adds running rampant, hit Heart of the Wild pick em up, deal with it, gg you have saved your raid), you seem to be a VERY pessimistic person...</div></div><hr />

Im pretty sure being alive helps you heal. These talents look to do that, first one helps give holy power, 2nd one helps you stay alive passively, and 3rd is a cd to keep you alive.</div></div><hr />

At the moment I'm playing Elem, and I have to choose where I'm putting 5 points, every other talent points are mandatory.<br />

The hunter tree, for example: All of the choices are important choices, but only two of them directly affect DPS - tier 1 and tier 5. And even then, I imagine the choices would be substantial. If I wanted higher on-demand burst, I would take Arcane Arrows in tier one and Readiness in tier 5, then unload all my cooldowns twice in burn-phase, with Arcane Arrows returning enough focus to keep flinging arrows. If I wanted higher sustained DPS, I would take Venom Tipped Arrows in T1 and Thrill of the Hunt in T5. Fervor, on the other hand, doesn't look that useful. In the current state of hunter abilities, if 1/7 abilities procced a 100% cost return with Thrill of the Hunt would probably give back quite a bit more focus in those 2 minutes.. but that's why these talents aren't set in stone.</div></div><hr />

Looking at my main class/spec (PvE resto druid), I find that two of the six choices are obvious and two of the six choices are absolutely irrelevant, as none of the talents would meaningfully impact PvE. The two tiers of choices that are interesting would be great if the three options were truly balanced numerically. Can Blizzard find six sets of three balanced choices for 11 classes? We will see.<br />
<br />
The other problem I see is that talents for hybrid classes, particularly for the four-tree druids, are going to get insanely complicated at times, as they have to throw a bone to each spec. Some druid talents already fill up the entire text box and don't even say what they will do for all four specs!</div></div><hr />

Ret - Wait, I have to choose between PoJ and LA now? Fine, I'll take Long Arm and guess you can consider PoJ as a nerf. Didn't want that speed increase anyways. Level 30 tier: Holy - Awesome, I get to choose between a stun, a cc, or snare. Well my teammate has a snare, so its between a CC and stun, which do you think I can use to get the better results? Ret - Wait, I have to choose between my stun, CC, and snare? Didn't I have 2/3 of these things before? And was asking for the 3rd to be viable, now you want me to go to just one?! Okay, i want a stun, guess I'll again rely on that teammate for a snare, fun fun!, and i'll lose out on my CC, that's fine I didn't want that anyways. Level 45 tier: Holy - Awesome, do i want blessed light or sacred shield? I roll with Blessed light now and I like it, guess I'll keep that. SS, although good, isn't active all the time and I can get more healing out of blessed light. Ret - Okay, obvious choice, I'll take Sacred Shield please... but wait, I lost PoJ's holy power generation, so that Blessed Light talent just became more important to me. Design play? Not really, because again, Ret is 'losing' something here. Holy had a choice, do you want to stay the same with blessed light or mix it up, ret just lost extra holy power generation. It's fine holy power isn't slow to generate i didn't want that extra boost anyways. level 60 tier: Holy - Do i want selfless Healer, eternal glory or holy shield. A shield would be nice, but I got LoD and WoG to use my holy power on i dont need a 3rd heal. Selfless healer, 1 FoL every 16 seconds? kek. Guess that just leaves Eternal Glory, sweet deal. Ret - Eternal Glory, no question, with keeping inquistion up, using holy power on TV, losing Divine purpose and Zealotry (maybe) it's a no brainer! But wait that means I lost selfless healer, my heals no longer crit like a lay on hands. crap, that's fine I like RNG and didn't need to heal my teammates anyways. level 75 tier: Holy - AoE freedom, Acts of sacirfice, or clemency. Those are three spells I didn't have before, can I go wrong with which ever i choose? Ret - Prep or an AoE HoF?! awesome, oh well wait, I can no longer remove roots on me, I have to get a stun to get a kill so I have no snare, and Long Arm of the Law is still questionable at best, guess I'll just keep the same old acts of sacrifice, yay! level 90 tier: Holy - Holy Avenger (Zealotry), Sanctified Wrath, or Divine Purpose. Holy cow! these are 3 spells I've never had before, how can I go wrong? No matter what new shinnies! Ret - Okay, do I go with Zealotry, Avenging Wrath / hammer of wrath combo, or Divine Purpose. Okay lets think about this, Divine Purpose is good, but RNG so meh. Sanctified Wrath is good, but is dispelable, holy avenger is a better zealotry so lets go with Holy Avenger. Oh crap, I just lost out on 2 talents I originally had, not only is that going to make my combat system more boring, but i lose out on 2 talents in a way. Again this is a very rough look into, and you have no clue what beta will bring, but from a first glace, Ret got the short end of the stick here. It was just bad examples on Blizzard's part. This looks incredibly boring for Ret because it was basically &quot;half&quot; of what Ret is now, if you'd ask a prot or holy paladin, they would probably give you a much better response.</div></div><hr />

Thats now what majority of WOW players are after. And it will hurt the game. Once more. Blizzard need to cut the core between PVP and PVE. They are not and when more than half of the talent tree is focused for PVP - and some talent tiers have zero intresting or effective role for certain specs of the class. The 6 talents you pick must all be EXTRA important and usefull for every spec and role - both for PVP and PVE. Its far from that atm. Huge amount of work is needed in these. But ye... they are dumbing the game down even more than ever.</div></div><hr />

Making them more complex is dumbing down ? before you picked a spec and you picked certain talents, there was no choice, no difficulty, all those things in your talent tree might as well have been passive, and now when choose your spec you WILL GET ALL THE STUFF that used to be in the old talent tree passively PLUS now you have to actually make some decisions about which 6 of the 18 EXTRA abilities you want on top of everything you used to have.<br />
<br />
The only REAL talents you could put some thought into in the old trees was the 2 or 3 leftover points at the end of your spec that youd use to choose between 3 useless talents. now you get 6 points to choose between 18 awesome talents, it wounds amazing.<br />

<br />
When was the last time you didn't play a mandatory spec? First time we are truly close of getting rid of the &quot;i-must-take-this&quot; -talents and actually be able to choose talents depending on the encounter (Do I need more utility? Do I need more certain kind of defensive approach? Does my pet have higher up-time on boss then me so I should decide to boost it instead of myself?). <br />
<br />
In PvP this is more of a revolution than ever. Consider the present situation where choice is very limited and you can only go few different ways in PvP when it comes to talents (you are forced to choose 99% of your talents). Now you actually have 3*3*3*3*3*3 (=729) different combinations / person that you can run against an opponent without them having any information (former mandatory talents) what you are going to run on any given game.</div></div><hr />

Obviously, one of the new battlegrounds is a direct duplicate of The Black Garden in Rift (every mechanic is identical... there's not even an attempt to modify it except in terms of flavor). But the talent system goes the other way. Obviously, the talent system in Rift can't be duplicated in WoW because WoW has too many base classes. If you gave each class in WoW 9 talent trees and let everyone go all the way to the 51-point talent in two trees, there would be no way to even begin class balance. So WoW took the idea of allowing specs to hybridize and simplified the talent trees while allowing for that. I like it, and I think this is the way games are supposed to learn from each other. The only down side is that WoW continues to be a completely different game every expansion, and I'm no longer 100% certain I want to learn yet another WoW variant this time around... we shall see.<br />

<br />
It's not changing cookie cutter builds so much as baking them in. The &quot;build&quot; you get no choice in. Your min/max decisions have all been made (or that's the idea; I saw one or two talents that might be problematic, but only one or two). Instead of choosing the min/max, core rotation items, you only choose the utility and playstyle items. Down side: there's no choice in the core talents anymore, other than to choose a spec. Up side: you don't need Wowpopular and Wowhead to tell you how to build a spec anymore because you can't. I'm in wait-and-see mode. MoP is not baked yet, and a LOT will change.<br />

Is anyone else less than thrilled at the idea of having only 6 talents?<br />
<br />
You have a lot more than 6 talents. You have 6 choices. You never really had more than 6 choices (zero for some specs), so it could be argued that you actually have more choice, now. What they've taken away is a lot of button-pressing to select those 0-6 talents. The success of this hinges on Blizzard being able to deliver on the promise that the new talents will be so utility-oriented that choosing one over the other at each rank won't realistically be min-maxable for the general case (though it obviously will be on a per-fight basis in PvE).</div></div><hr />

It allows you to charge twice before incurring the cooldown. So the cooldown is still 20 sec.<br />

So i can pick 6 talents total (at lvl 90) and all of them will be in the same tree (there won't be any trees actually). <br />
<br />
What do you think, how will they solve hybrid class talents? Judging from this pic: http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/pp76.jpg if you want to be tank, you really dont have much of a choice.<br />
<br />
Well, you still choose your specialization and get in the field training at the appropriate levels for class and role-specific abilities, but now you could, if you want, have Bladestorm as a tank.:D</div></div><hr />

Well, now you get to learn it all over AGAIN. This is how they make their expansion's NEW........ feeling like. :confused:<br />
<br />
While I would say this true, I also think Blizzard is doing something better and legit this time. When they first announced how they were dealing with the talent systems in Cataclysm I was disappointed when I first saw their examples, I pretty much was disappointed with Cataclysm via mainly but not limited to class/role/spec changes before it even came out.<br />
<br />
I look at MoP's model for class design and so on, now this looks spot on, I would give some thought into coming back into WoW now that there are some designs that in my mind I can finally say &quot;hell yeah&quot; about.<br />
<br />
Thing is though, SWTOR will be coming out, shortly followed suit by some other AAA RPGs and MMO(RPG)s, and its hard for me to keep my eye sights on WoW beyond that Which I doubt MoP will be out in just a few months (2-3).<br />

It's OK to feel a bit weird about Druid talents at this very moment. Those talents are the most unfinished ones and will see heavy tuning / changes before the beta and the actual expansion.</div></div><hr />

Totally agree. Changing the entire game each year, players could as well actually play a new game instead.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, ppl actually enjoy that game style and that's why they don't leave it for another. It's the good and old &quot;If I wanted to play that, I would play that&quot;. For example, If I wanted to play Rift, I would play Rift, not expecting to WoW to change to Rift. It's like if Assassin's Creed changed it's style at each game. &quot;ppl enjoy Battlefield, so we tought that we could put some FPS action on the new Assassin's Creed&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of the entire tiers are totally and utterly worthless for certain specs. With only 6 awailable talents.... thats just horrendously bad design. <br />
<br />
IN PVE <br />
If you play a tank - every talent should improve you as a tank <br />
If you play healer - every talent shold improve you as a healer <br />
If you play DPS - every talent should improve you as dps <br />
<br />
<br />
These are the 3 basic roles that BLizzard THEMSELFS have created and they are creating a talent system that forces a healer to take tank talent ? Thats 1 of 6 talents point gone for noting. THAT IS POINTLESS talent. <br />
<br />
Some of the tiers are designed around PVP only and thats even more horrible. <br />
<br />
Really really bad. PPL will realise this the more they look at it.<br />
<br />
Ok I am sure other people have already commented on this post and I didn't get a chance to read through everything but I'll just make my own comment. Blizz clearly stated that these aren't the &quot;only&quot; talents. Each char will have abilities that are learned as we lvl up like hammer of the righteous for prot paladin or holy shock for holy paladin etc. The talent tree now doesn't act as a spec like it used to more of a utility tree so we can pick a talent out of our current spec like having ardent defender on a ret pala or shadow step for a assassination rogue. I think these new changes bring more of a choice to the game instead of just going a certain build up to the last talent point. I might prefer killing spree for pure dps but another rogue might prefer shadow step for pvp and we could both be combat rogues. (I don't play a rogue btw just giving it as an example)<br />
<br />
From the looks of the new talents it might seem like there are 3 choices for each tier and they each represent a spec but that's not the case. It really helps to read the whole post instead of just parts of it and it helps even more to do some research before massive qq. This goes to everybody bashing on the new changes. You don't have to like it but don't hate it because you don't understand it.<br />

I see EVERY class and every specc have BIG BIG improvements for PvP, besides Resto druids..... Well, now its clear to me, what i've thought since Cata came. BLIZZARD HATES RESTO DRUIDS for PvP.... This is just pathetic, we need some BIG improvement....<br />
<br />
Hmm I must be the worst pvp'er in the history of wow but I can still survive against 3-4 people beating on me like mad while wearing pve gear. I'd say resto druids are pretty powerful in pvp.<br />

I have read through almost all of the 12 pages of comments at the time I finished reading. I can see a lot of people both complaining and liking the new changes. I would like to share my opinion a bit as well: 1: This is the most important fact : &quot;Talents are not set in stone&quot;. At the moment MoP is basically a pre alpha stage. These talents are going to change many many times over. They will be way different than how they are now, with a very low chance of staying same if they work well. 2: I am personally liking the changes not only talent wise but we just learn our abilities while leveling up instead of visiting a trainer. 3: It's quite cool to be able to change our talents mid encounter instead of visiting a trainer 4: Dual spec still exists so we can be both healer/dps. But I personally would have loved to see a third spec availability, maybe at a huge cost like 10k gold or more. As a paladin I'd love to have all 3 specs, retribution, protection and holy. The new class monks can also perform all 3 roles very efficiently blizz says but then again we don't know how they will work so can't say anything about those. 5: So far new exp as well as new talent system looks good, needs some tweaks for sure but overall I like the idea.</div></div><hr />

Agreed with both of you. In an effort to get new subs Blizzard is completely changing things, and doing it to often. Instead of sticking with what made WoW WOW, they are changing up everything. For some people that's been fine, but for a lot of people, myself included, it's a massive turnoff. At this point it doesn't even feel like WoW to me anymore.</div></div><hr />
