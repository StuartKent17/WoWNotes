I love it. Pretty much what I was expecting from a zone that's been underwater for 10000 years. The zone is great with enough variation to keep it interesting for a while by itself - far more so than the Broken Shore we got in 7.2, never mind that we also have Mechagon. Looking forward to playing in the zone for 6 months.</div></div><hr />

See, it's like sex. Blizzard is going for these 30 second sessions with these unsatisfying popshots on the audience- opting for more numerous popshots instead of more satisfying popshots. I'm of the opinion that it's better to abstain from the popshot for a longer period of time, making the eventual popshot even more satisfying for both parties.<br />

See what I mean dawg? They just aren't holding out long enough essentially.</div></div><hr />

I’m not talking about Warcraft 3, I’m talking about WoW. It’s safe to say Blizz has diverged greatly from its RTS roots with World of Warcraft, and nothing in this game shows that.<br />
Also, in your video most of those buildings were, like I said, open buildings and not actual residence style buildings or huts/tents in an attack.<br />
Either way, in WoW, no style of domiciles have been shown other than ruins of a destroyed nation, even when in Vash’jir and their territory.</div></div><hr />

This is true, but I think they are trying to stay away from using the same base skeleton too much and Vulpera has way nicer updates and animations than the Gilblin and that is not to say Gilblin can't but it seems like they are keeping them followers for now.<br />

As stated before, that is a heroic whimsical style for the good guys. Most villainous style cities don’t utilize vibrant colors. As I also stated though, even though Blizz took this approach (which I don’t have anything wrong with) I wish they had also gone with more of a corrupted look. More old god flair or even just more Naga touches, like broken statues on the ground with newly erected Naga statues.</div></div><hr />

I was hoping you responded as I scrolled down lol. I agree with your analogy completely. The game is a bunch of tiny moments of instant gratification, so much so that it is completely boring (to me). RIP wow. Overall it’s been a really amazing 15 years. Moved on to FF14 and ESO a while back and I personally am glad for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, my concern is that it’s dark and bland. There’s 1 area with bioluminescence and that’s it. They should add more of that to the whole zone. Bioluminescent rocks, kelp, fish, etc. Along with that add some more vibrant/bright colors. Add some water-glow to the water that surrounds the zone. Make the zone bright at night. <br />
<br />
There’s been pictures and videos linked in this thread of some good ideas. It just looks too bland and dark right now. All they’d need to do is add more bioluminescence (said this word way too much the past few hours) to rocks, overhangs, kelp and aquatic life. Add more vibrant colors and make the water glow a bit by adding some bioluminescent fish inside the water wall as well as some kelp as well. That’d make the zone really nice to look at.<br />
<br />
Zangarmarsh is a good example someone mentioned before. That zone is pretty damn bright due to the giant mushrooms and in turn it’s really fun to run around in and look at.</div></div><hr />

I really hope a bunch more polish is added before launch because the idea of spending extended time in this zone is worrying. Since the buildings have been underwater for 10K years surely some coral etc would have grown on them? Bam, colour!<br />

I know this isn't typically how they've worked, I just hope that after Legion they wouldn't make these followers a pain in the neck again. Some of the worst quests while leveling a rogue are the ones where you get a &quot;helper&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Those screenshots look so generic I really can't say it's a new place or something randomly chosen from a 10-years-ago WoW location.</div></div><hr />

I get it... but I think some more lively colours would do this place a lot more justice than a 'washed up' look. Give it a bit of the cata water dungeon (name escapes me right now) glow in at least some parts would be nice, that dungeon is just glorious in its colour and architecture. I'm not on PTR but how is the size of the area? Is it similar to Argus playable regions?</div></div><hr />
