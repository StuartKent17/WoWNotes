Upcoming Azerite Armor Improvements<br />
Why does it even need to be based on your item history to begin with? Why can't it just be based on your general item level like every other world quest and emissary gear reward?<br />
That's what we mean by item history. It calculates your general item level (as you put it) based on all items you've looted, including items you may no longer have. This way if you loot an item that's a few item levels higher than what you have equipped, then decide you don't want it and vendor or disenchant it, you're still seeing higher item level rewards from world quests, emissaries, etc.</div></div><hr />

Oh my, that's quite the nerf. Then again, if you're doing mythic G'huun, I doubt this was a major issue and just makes it so you don't demand 4 warlocks.</div></div><hr />

I will say this. My monk is ilvl 353 and all the Azeroth gear on my map is ilvl 325. So again I dont see this system working and the gear is not scaling. Unless its reading my OS since its like 329</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizz keeps trying to make fetch happen.<br />
<br />
They can't get it through their heads that they need to stop making turret casters even less mobile in both the PvE and PvP aspects of the game. Some incompetent melee probably got trashed by a Frost Mage and got all wound up. Current Blizz developers have very little clue as to what they are doing, so they are responding to the incompetent melees rather than stepping back and looking at how their own game actually plays.</div></div><hr />

That nerf is targeted at fire/assa/x.. you're not dodging a meteor without trinket up against that.<br />

<br />
Exactly. I don't understand the reasoning. I feel like these nerfs are made by someone who doesn't even know the class. Enhance literally has a single shitty defensive that lasts 8 seconds with a 2min CD. You can heal 5 times before going OOM. So now its like.. heal 2-3 times max for 18-20k and hope you'll survive? I've had ret spam crit TV for 40k a pop and they have ridiculous defensives and resets on top of that. Enhance is a shitty spec at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems blizzard has confirmed also making the point that that the issue appeared influenced by loot specialization changes player may have used and that the initial ilvl threshold was too high ( i.e. players already exceeding ilvl 370 were rewarded 370 gear in most cases not needed whereas many folks in the 360's, even the high 360's were only getting rewarded 355 gear. )..</div></div><hr />

<br />
everytime i read these comments i think to myself, does this guy really have a clue whats going on on the leaderboards in terms of esports in world of warcraft?<br />
<br />
the double nerf to cometstorm for example, we can all agree that maybe a 10-15% nerf would be enough but ontop of the 20% they remove the ice form traits(only reason we used this talent btw) from existence leaving us with no desirable class traits to begin with, effectivly double nerfing them to the ground to the point where one might compare pve shaman threads about mythic raids. <br />
<br />
meteor nerf, it has really never been a problem in higher pvp due to the fact it Splits evenly among targets hit and you can move out/get gripped or as many higher teams do is when they read that the &quot;go&quot; or &quot;setup&quot; from teh enemy mage team is coming they semi stack up so that all the traits/aoe/ignite breaks the cc and worst case, the meteor is split on 3 targets meaning it does like 10k as an ability that already has a 45second cooldown and paired with a class that has no stun by itself. <br />
<br />
meanwhile these nerfs are put out before blizzcon it leaves the wonder to how demon hunters or boomkins(80k starsurges x2) can be gone unnoticed amongs their utlity and undispelable cc(mass dispelable tho) cyclone &amp; ofc bash &amp; offheals.<br />
<br />
and dont get me started on things like warlock drain life being a thing in the game?<br />
<br />
<br />
in my mind the meteor nerf was a &quot;hit them with the goodnight&quot; but rather they shouldve perhaps buffed the other traits and reworked meteor itself.<br />
<br />
the enha shaman nerfs today were also a typical &quot;we rather nuke the design/abilities instead of overtime nerf/rework to fir the overall pvp meta/gameplay we intended&quot; <br />
<br />
why would you ever invite an enha shamans now? any other class offers more in terms of cc, damage, survivability and teamsynergy now.<br />
<br />
the only nerf i actually agree with is somewhat the assasination nerf as its somewhat slight but does not remove the gameplay/meta of how the class performs/acts/brings to the table.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogue mage druid has been an annoyance for years but again this game is somewhat of a rock paper sicors where jungle/phdk / enha/ele + sp &amp; a healer does really well against among comps like jungle that is seen as the rmp killers. <br />
<br />
blizzards design goals where they rather kill off the entire body over cutting of the finger/arm is somewhat concerning and can probably be tracked back to the recent high names leaving blizzard in my eyes, something points towards just being clueless in design. Talk to the top pvpers, talk to the blizzcon attendies blizzard please, we want to help..</div></div><hr />

Again: Blizzard removed talents from the talent tree to simplify selection and to reduce waste. Yet, the Azerite armor system is the most complex and overwhelmingly complicated system I've ever seen, and the RnG is just exacerbated by the randomness of what you now get as part of the bandaid for getting useless traits.</div></div><hr />

Sub-120, you actually get mana-drained.<br />

It's the same bug they put in for healers in PvP a month ago.<br />
<br />
How the fuck do you screw up scaling mana regen based on level? If there's code to scale it, you don't need to put in a flat static value to subtract it. Just do an if(PvP) regen *= .70<br />
<br />
It's not that fucking hard.</div></div><hr />

Enh Shamans was too strong in every way in PvP, they needed to be nerfed.<br />
<br />
We weren't broken at all, after 4 heals we were OOM. <br />
<br />
Just faced paladins in arena, they have better burst and can heal better then we did before the nerf. <br />
<br />
Again Blizzard just doesn't like shamans being anywhere near the top, BFA is seriously the worse expansion for shamans for years.</div></div><hr />

Not healing wise, maybe a few too much burst damage from stormstrike but nothing other specs can still do and haven't been touched. Now not only are we glass cannons with the least amount of def cooldowns in the game, we're also paying for the hybrid tax being our healing which now sucks.<br />
<br />
Shaman DPS is in such a poor state, attempting to do any challenging PvE content and you either get benched or never invited. Why? Because we're just not very tough and bring nothing other classes can't do better. The one shining light enhancement had was we were very good in PvP because of our self-healing and good burst which has now been sliced by 1/3.<br />
<br />
Blizzard sure know how to make shaman players feel good, BFA is a low point for class design and balancing.</div></div><hr />

Hahahahahahaahaahahahahahahaahhaha Are you kidding? If ret palas Are doing more burst than you as an enh shaman you have forgotten to equip your weapons mate. Shamans do more outside of burst than a pala with wings on</div></div><hr />

Enhance burst is unpredictable, ret burst is pretty reliable. I think you should try some 2’s or are you trolling?</div></div><hr />

1 enhancement shaman in the top 50 3 vs 3 arena. <br />
nerfing the mana regen also nerfed purge.<br />
Without swelling waves talent in pvp our healing is abysmal now. <br />
<br />
The burst damage nerf was annoying, the mana regen/healing nerf has destroyed us. I get the impression you've got nubstomped by too many enhancement going toe to toe with them, rather then focusing on their weaknesses to easily beat them.<br />
<br />
Let me just throw some numbers, <br />
<br />
healing surge costs 5,000 mana.<br />
purge costs 4,000 mana.<br />
MP5 was 3,200 and now is 2,240.<br />
Our total mana is 20,000.<br />
<br />
Healing surge heals my character for 11,336, lets just say 11.5k. We can do 4 heals before going OOM, before we can cast our fifth heal we'll have to wait 15 seconds. <br />
<br />
2,240x2=4,480<br />
<br />
So for a 11.5k heal every 15 seconds, on characters with roughly 120k+ on average hp. <br />
<br />
Our healing has been gutted and we're still paying for the hybrid tax, the healing and mana nerf was too much. We're already glass cannons with the least amount of defensive cooldowns in the game. <br />
<br />
Blizzard, wake the fuck up.</div></div><hr />
