<br />
Raid Testing Schedule - June 7th<br />
On Friday June 7th, we will be conducting Mythic raid testing in The Eternal Palace.<br />
<br />
June, 7th<br />
<br />
Za’qul, Harbinger of Ny’alotha - Mythic Eternal Palace<br />
13:00 PDT (16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST)<br />
Blackwater Behemoth - Mythic Eternal Palace<br />
14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST)<br />
Orgozoa - Mythic Eternal Palace<br />
15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a test environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br />
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br />
<br />
Q: What character should I use to test the raid?<br />
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players’ effective level to 120 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounter(s) being tested.<br />
<br />
Q: How long does testing last?<br />
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we’re satisfied that we’ve received that information for a given boss, we’ll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, we don't know how to get it. I'm starting to think they're making it into a &quot;Secret&quot; for the initial steps, followed by a grind once those steps are done. Don't think the Secret starter is activated.</div></div><hr />

Wowwowwow! Secret mounts are tight!<br />
<br />
*ahem* But seriously, yeah, I see what you mean with the grind - if it's true, this might turn out to be quite interesting (especially if it's not fricking time-gated..)</div></div><hr />

The stupid amounts of gold sinks started in Legion. Before that, the most expensive mount was like 20k, other than the yak mount. The prices of mounts now are literally just a way for Blizzard to push those tokens.</div></div><hr />

Ever heard of inflation?<br />
there is videos calculating the average gold of a player now, and back in the days of vanilla, tbc, wotlk, etc, and they are about the same, there hasnt been some massive kick in &quot;THIS MOUNT IS WAAAY TOO EXPENSIVE!&quot; other then 2 specific mounts, the only ones to ever cost millions.<br />
<br />
i would agree, spider and long neck way too expensive<br />
but 500k mount? nah mate, its literally nothing compared to some old mounts.<br />
<br />
but no, the biggest mount cost was 20k in wotlk, i dont think there was one for cata, then mop 120k, then wod 200k, then legion and BFA 500k<br />
<br />
legion did have 2 mil and BFA 5 mil, but i agree those 2 are too much, but these 500k nah they are on the norm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That way you don't actually have to pay gold, isn't that a win? :)<br />
While others that are just not lucky or don't like farming a dungeon will have an option to buy it (even if the rusted version imho looks bad).<br />
<br />
People like different variations of mounts to match to their character, and there is a bunch of actual new mount models here, even if used for a variety of recolors.</div></div><hr />

Basically they'd be stuck in the transition animation if you killed them while they were starting the transition (but still hitable), thus invincible, because the last one standing would keep regenerating.</div></div><hr />

really? cause inflation has massivly kicked up the gold in the economy, in wod the token was 30k, its now 120k, how does that work if not for gold inflation? tokens dont put gold into the economy, they take it out.<br />

I remember tokens being 30k for all of like two days before they rocketed up to 75k+. They haven't gone past 115k since the beginning of Legion so your inflation theory doesn't work.</div></div><hr />

oh look a slow and constant groth that got slightly raised with legion and sped up with legion as... happens every expansion, it makes more gold then the last. also the burst from when they made it balance you got instead of JUST sub time.<br />
EXCEPT BFA which dropped the massive gold making you could get from garrisons with gold followers and gold follower missions and etc etc. and legions instant complete world quests on tons of toons, and just... tons of gold missions.<br />
<br />
maybe do some research next time &quot;buddy&quot;<br />
<br />
https://puu.sh/DBw36/9f341b466a.mp4<br />
sure looks like ALOT more then 2 days mate.<br />
<br />
funny you say &quot;was 30k for 2 days then rocketed up to 75k&quot; dont know what universe you are in but april 7th 2015 to feb 5th 2017 is not &quot;2 days&quot; more like 2 years mate...<br />

<br />
oh also i guess you dont know how to math<br />
https://i.imgur.com/04MA9QL.png<br />

cause seems the token was WELL OVER 115k for a long while during legion...</div></div><hr />

nah not really, an example of a mount that was more pricey then others but was not &quot;THE&quot; pricey mount would be the snowy gryphon which cost more then normal gryphons... and well it was just white, thats it.</div></div><hr />
