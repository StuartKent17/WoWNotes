Most Blizzard employees agree but they need money + alliance = easier for new people to watch<br />
if it sell well = I won't get surprise too see Horde movie</div></div><hr />

well if it said outland, that would imply the movie is set after the destruction, but since it says draenor, the movie must be set before draenor explodes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dalaran would make sense for the start of it, since Khadgar comes from Dalaran. Stormwind is self-explanatory. Draenor would be used for the hallucination scenes where Khadgar sees into the future and him fighting on Draenor. I'm don't think they ever go to Ironforge though... so I'm not sure about that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless the movie is bridging the gap between MOP and WOD. If it was before the destruction, Dalaran would not be on floating rocks.<br />

Was only a rumor, the fact even a screenshot of the video didn't get leaked, tells me that it was just a long going gag. Movies don't often have a trailer 2 years before its to be released, even this early, a teaser is a lot of ask. That and they said themselves that they hadn't even started filming.</div></div><hr />

Well, for your extras, all they have to do is find the biggest, ugliest guys at the bodybuilding place, give 'em a hair and paint job, and stick some prosthetic tusks in their jaw.<br />
<br />
But who could play Durotan? I don't know, unless they can get Conan-era Arnold in there with a time-machine.</div></div><hr />

They show it at comic-con, but not blizzcon? They where hesitant to even reveal 2 characters. Makes sense...Considering there isn't even a single frame of this CGI teaser, I call BS. At least until I see, hard, physical proof. Not just some people believing that there was.</div></div><hr />

Wait are you actually for real? You do realise that Peter Jackson had done just a few Gorefest B-Movies before LOTR right? How he even fucking convinced those studio execs (Thank fuck he did though) to let him do LOTR is insane. <br />
<br />
Who knows what the movie is going to bring, perhaps it'll be another typical shitty Video Game movie, but honestly Duncan Jones is ok, he could quite possibly pull out a master piece like LOTR (Although I really do doubt it, LOTR was perfect &amp; that's kinda hard to match). <br />
<br />
Also to anyone talking about the whole &quot;Comic-Con got a Teaser &amp; Blizzcon didn't&quot; ... Well that's because there's lots of Trailers that are specific to Comic-Con ... Why would they show it at Blizzcon if it was a specific agreement made in regards to the whole Comic-Con stuff to ONLY show the Teaser at Comic-Con? Who knows, maybe there was a Teaser, maybe there wasn't ... But why the fuck would they lie about? <br />
<br />
Finally the whole &quot;But this breaks lore&quot; ... This is literally just people going, &quot;M-Muh Lore!&quot; It's a random, one-off movie... They are not ret-conning anything, this movie is not going to be any official cannon, this movie is not trying to change anything... They are merely taking interesting (at least to the writers) characters &amp; throwing them into a story that works best for a Movie. That is all.</div></div><hr />

It was a &quot;mood piece,&quot; in other words a test shoot to establish the look and feel of the movie, likely for the benefit of executives and producers. They explained that back when they showed it at Comic Con.<br />
<br />
Filming doesn't start until January, so obviously they haven't shot any actual scenes from the script yet.<br />
<br />
Comic Con does this exclusive shit all the time. They're most likely locked up in contract and can't legally release the teaer to the public.</div></div><hr />

Excuse me, Heavenly Creatures? He was the producer for that film, and for those other films too. Don't think Mr.Jones has so much as attempted tackling that sort of subject matter.

No, but the people we know who are working on this have a pretty good track record.<br />
<br />
Director: Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code)<br />
Screenplay: Duncan Jones, Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond)<br />
Cinematographer: Simon Duggan (The Great Gatsby)<br />
Editor: Paul Hirsch (Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, 'nuff said)<br />

Producing is nothing like directing. Producers deserve almost no credit for the artistic vision of a film; their job is to make sure the creative folk get the money that they need and to ensure that work is getting done.<br />
<br />
That's why you constantly see flop movies that are advertised like, &quot;From the producers who brought you a blockbuster!&quot;<br />

I... err... what? What are you even talking about?<br />
<br />
I cannot make sense of anything you are saying. The point is that Duncan Jones has Moon &amp; Source Code under his belt, Peter Jackson had a few Gorefest B-Movies &amp; Heavenly Creatures was hardly a Box Office or Cinematic success. Yet Peter Jackson (And the talented people with him) pulled off one of the greatest Trilogies of all time, Duncan Jones could easily do something great with Warcraft. <br />
<br />
If you actually think Duncan Jones isn't at least a decent director, you clearly have not watched either of his films.</div></div><hr />

so that is the reason when a movie gets an Oscar, a main Producer goes and picks it up first......:)<br />
<br />
sure, some producers on movies are just titles and they dont do anything, but main Producer is the head of production. Sure he doesnt have a lot to do with artistic approach, but he/she is the person who picks right ppl for those jobs.</div></div><hr />

As someone who attended said panel at Comic Con, there was a teaser shown. It was shown by Legendary, the production team behind Duncan Jones and the movie. As with anything shown in Hall H ahead of its time, it was more a mood piece to gauge reactions and interest in the project.

When I heard they planned on making the movie alliance central, I felt like puking up over my warcraft novels. I don't want a movie that only has good guy humans against evil generic orcs, if I wanted that I'd watch lord of the rings or the hobbit.<br />
<br />
I want to see the good guys in the horde as well as the bad, and durotan as the main horde protagonist makes it nicely balanced in that. Well the outcome will be obvious to anyone knowing warcraft past, that doesn't make they can't develop the orcs in a better way then just warhammer football thugs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, neither did Jackson when he took on LotR. And somehow that turned out well. I'll give Jones the benefit of the doubt for now.<br />
<br />
Regarding &quot;Durotan vs Lothar,&quot; they could just mean the characters' individual ideologies and personal narratives contrasting with each others in the face of the First War and the threat of the Horde. I.E. Lothar struggles to defend and protect his people against the new threat while Durotan struggles to defend his culture and people (Frostwolves) from the changing and frightening new Orcish behavior.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong though, but to me that sounds WAY cooler for a film than an actual &quot;Durotan vs Lothar physically on the battlefield&quot; scenario.</div></div><hr />

It's true they don't have anything to do with each other directly, but they indirectly affect each other. They are from the same timeline. The good guys of their factions. I hope they show Durotan's assassination and where Aedelas Blackmoore finds baby Thrall leading to Warcraft 2 movie where will be based on Lord of the Clans book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Durotan wasn't even part of the war right? He and his Frostwolf clan was exiled and then they settled in Alterac Valley. They will probably bend the lore a bit to make it interesting enough.</div></div><hr />

if it sell well = I won't get surprise too see Horde movie<br />
<br />
Nope... have you seen lotr? there was quite alot of evil side scenes aswell and people liked it alot.<br />
<br />
Warcraft has always been about orcs vs humans, if you dont do that it wont be a warcraft movie.<br />
<br />
Leaving horde out would be a huge loss in good characters just like lotr had orcs speak and such, without those scenes the trilogy would have sucked. Even tho orcs werent a major part in Lotr story in any other way than being the evil.<br />
<br />
In warcraft orcs arent evil, they are a nation aswell... only reason they became evil at one point was due to demon influence, just like many humans have become evil but not an entire human nation because humans have been protected by night elves and dragons... orcs didnt have that protection, they only had themselves, ogres and draenei around in which ogres were enemy and draenei werent talking with the orcs much... other than trading sometimes.<br />
<br />
In every other movie or story, the orcs are evil and they dont have deep background... in warcraft orcs are equal to any other race in story depth except they have been the race with the most bad moments in their history... if you dont count how long the elves have been alive.</div></div><hr />

Not just that but if they try to make the orcs some center for the story along with humans I don't see this being a good thing. It doesent matter how much you love orcs inwarcraft, I just don't see it selling to the mass crowd after watching something like lotr. Demon infested blood thirsty orcs vs humans. I wonder which way the viewing audience will lean. I wonder which way the gamers that know the lore will lean.<br />
<br />
There going to lose the audience if they try to make the orcs out to be misunderstood.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing you didn't watch the panel. That's not their intention, the orcs aren't just going to be the &quot;monsters&quot; and that's it.</div></div><hr />

Its a Rigging system, and rigging system includes joints..I think you dont have your Animation knowledge up to date. Its called a Rig or a joint because in Maya thats what you have to do and you have to build a rig for the face, a rig and a joint system for the body and everything else. So its going to take quite a while for the other characters to be done.</div></div><hr />

Love the garrison idea, new character models were a long time coming. Just feels weird to me to remove stats that have been in the game so long. I'm sure they have a plan for replacing how you will get hit/exp, &amp; how tanks will avoid without dodge/parry...but right now it definitely feels weird. Also, I liked reforging...but I understand why they are removing it. It became mandatory vs. the bonus it was supposed to feel like. Kind of feels like all the min/maxing potential is being removed.</div></div><hr />
