This will make gearing alt even easier, I've always have my alts not very geared for this reason. I hate having to run Heroics mindlessly over and over. <br />

<br />
Will this decrease the amount of caster newbies that autoattack their way up to lvl 10 or even higher?. Anyways I like it; however, I see no reason to remove the water and food from new created toons, it makes no sense at all.<br />

Also, pleased to see the Burning Determination immunity time doubled. As it is it's a rather awful pvp talent. There has been a surprising amount of effort in making frost viable for pve and fire viable for pvp recently. I hope Blizzard keeps up the mage love.</div></div><hr />

The following reputations have been sped up by roughly 30%:<br />
Argent Crusade<br />
Alliance Vanguard<br />
Horde Expedition<br />
Kirin Tor<br />
Knights of the Ebon Blade<br />
Sons of Hodir<br />
Wyrmrest Accord<br />
Sons of Hodir quests now give more reputation overall.<br />
Top-level helm and shoulder faction-related enchants are now available as Bind-on-Account items that do not require any faction to use once purchased (they still require the appropriate faction level to purchase).<br />
Reputation commendations can now be purchased for 1 Emblem of Triumph each.<br />

<br />
<br />
Do you HONESTLY think that will change ANYTHING? You could make it so that players have to be level 20 to spam trade chat and the gold farmers would STILL spam trade chat. You could make it level 80 to spam trade chat and you would just see more hacked accounts so that gold farmers could spam on the hacked accounts. <br />
<br />
You will NEVER stop gold farmers. It will never happen. Blizzard is wrong to think it will. If they would make it so that decent honest players could safely sell their gold then WoW gold farming wouldn't be a shady black market business. Take a lesson from the US government the only time you create prohibition all you manage to do is raise the organized crime rate (prohibition created the mob, the war on drugs created gangland).</div></div><hr />

I don't agree. It is possible to do all heroics and have your emblem gear and still not have all your reputations at full currently. Its not like you actually do heroics for drops.</div></div><hr />

That 10% has always been there it was just on another glyph (I believe anyways). The real buffs are the glyph of shadow and the haste scaling. When shadow priests start scaling with haste instead of just crit they should be doing MUCH better over all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would you grind ogres for Shattari rep when you can easily solo the Shattari mini bosses at level 80. The time lost scrolls and the bosses they summon are by far the easiest way to get Shattari rep now.</div></div><hr />

I was exalted with every daily faction at 70. So many days of dailies spent doing Shattari Skyguard, Ogri'la, Netherwing, and the Shattered Sun Offensive. <br />
<br />
Wrath doesn't really have a good faction to grind rep with for a mount like BC did. Sure, you can get the Oracles Revered for a small chance of a Proto Drake, and grind away at the Tournament to unlock ground mounts... but it's only recycled models with re-skins. I'd prefer something unique like the Nether Ray or the Nether Drake (Frostwyrm grind please)</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, the shoulders look a bit.. too big. And I know, the aim of the game is 'the person with the biggest shoulder armour wins' and all, but this is is madness! If they have some kinda really cool effects added to them, then they're awesome. Tier 10 isn't... awful... it's just... I don't like it myself XD, and the fact it's Harry Potter-esque makes me dislike it more XD<br />

<br />
in order for this new set2 bonus to be somewhat attractive it should say something like &quot;Your flash heal and prayer of mending spells...&quot;<br />
Flash Heal is not a spell i use very much on holy, mostly its a SoL proc. im guessing making it be Flash heal and PoM would make it good for both specs, however i dont have any idea of how that would turn out in terms of balance/fairness.<br />
<br />
its still quite dissapointing to see other classes bonuses to rock very hard, and ours is just getting worse and worse.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draelan</div><div class="date">2009-10-16, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just my thoughts on things so far:<br />
<br />
Mage Tier 10: AWESOME. The top of the helm is a little odd, but otherwise, I love it. Makes me want to level my Mage. How fast do you think I could get up those 72 levels? ;P<br />
Warlock Tier 10: I agree. It DOES look like Death Eater gear from Harry Potter. lol. But you know what? Thematically it fits, and it doesn't look terrible. <br />
Death Knight Tier 10: By far the BEST looking set I've seen so far. <br />
Druid Tier 10: The horns are kind of weird... but overall it doesn't look bad. <br />
Rogue Tier 10: It's a.... weird... looking set. It looks better on some races than others, but overall, not my favorite. At least it's not Tier 8!<br />
Warrior Tier 10: I like the overall look. Again, it looks odd on some races (male troll, male tauren) and some of the colors don't really look spectacular, but not bad overall.<br />
Hunter Tier 10: Why, oh why can't we get any good looking helms?! The helm is the only bad part about this set, really. Well... that, the purple coloration, and the boots are strange... At least I can keep my &quot;hide helm&quot; box checked. The rest isn't bad enough to make me dislike the set. <br />
<br />
Am I the only one who thinks the winged horse looks kind of weird? The rib cage seems to come down awful far... Well, maybe it looks better in motion. I also think the new Goblins don't look so good in still screen shots, but look fine in the Cataclysm video. *shrug* Regardless, it has potential.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Earth’s Grasp: This talent now also reduces the cooldown of the Stoneclaw and Earthbind totems by 15/30%.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is gonna make that talent a must have for me in pvp mode; a 30% reduction in the cd of my totem that when glyphed shields me? Yes please.<br />
<br />
30% reduction of 30sec will drop it to a 21second cd which gives a 15second shield; this will provide a good boost to Resto and Elemental shaman in pvp, but I can't speak for Enhance as I don't pvp that way.</div></div><hr />

How anticlimatic! I want at least a kiloton scale nuclear explosion of unholy power and ice cubes that blows some horde and alliance bystanders to bits. Seriously, this is one encounter where I'd like the loot from either a) a chest (in the Frozen Throne maybe?) b) from some sort of spectral remains with perhaps a couple of metal shards thrown about. Not that it's 100% sure we'll loot his physical &quot;human&quot; body, but if we do it's kind of lame. Oh well.<br />
<br />
(Best case scenario: Being severely wounded and dropping one's helmet is merely a se... slight inconvenience. He then rises as a revenant kind of thing, similar to how Ner'zhul appeared in WC3 when he was imprisoned, beginning the final phase of the encounter.)</div></div><hr />

It has also been used in atleast ZG, Naxx and ZA along with BT. The model can also be found from more than one 5-man/world mob, like at Gun'drak and Scholomance.</div></div><hr />

I want winged horse, but not skeletal winged horse... Particularly not this very very very deformed winged horse.<br />

Seriously, has anyone at Blizzard studied horse anatomy?<br />

Its legs should not be inside its ribs!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

Lock gear is awesome! I think it suits the warlock mentality perfectly, and gnome warlocks are creepy little buggers!<br />

If i'd want to use a pet while raiding I would dust off my hunter or my warlock :&lt; other than that nice changes and I guess the water elemental glyph would be nice for levelling :D<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't imagine the ice lance change will change that. A 15% chance (fingers of frost-&gt;ice lance) crit to reduce frostbolt by 1 second isn't going to be anywhere near enough to close that gap.<br />
<br />
Gonna be a total pita in pvp, though. Following up a shatter combo with a 1.3s (before haste) FB? Ow.</div></div><hr />

I thought it would be but I don't think it is. I don't see any similarities. I really got no clue where the inspiration for the Warlock set came from. When I saw it I actually sat there for close to a minute going &quot;uhm...... uhm..... what? oO&quot; Weirdest set in a long time imo.<br />
<br />
And while I did not fall in love with the mage set at first sight as I'd hoped, I still like it. As I hoped it's insipred by the gown of the San'layn, and maybe a bit by the PvP set, bothof which I like. It may not be as spectaculary awesome as I hoped it'd be but I like it.<br />
Now just gotta wait for the Paladin and I know what my last Lvl 80 char can look forward too. With the Arthas being a paladin in the past and Tirion Fordring being there etc. it should be really awesome. I try to connect my paladin as much as possible with the Argent Crusade, I hope the armor will fit that theme. We haven't really had a set that actually looks like it belongs to paladin since Tier 6 imo.<br />
<br />
Also... GIEF FLYING HORSIE!!!! Damn, that's awesome, I really hope that's not just a boss/boss-mount (Invincible?) but a drop as well.<br />
<br />
I also LOVE the first of the new mobs, it looks really freakin ugly, a real... &quot;abomination&quot; that actually deserves the name. Looking forward to beating the sh*t out of it's ugly head. ;)</div></div><hr />

P.S. Shouldn't the Lich King killing in 25 man's title be &quot;the Kingslayer&quot; just like the achivement? Because its the same as the 10 man one. :o</div></div><hr />

<br />
WHY! frost mage buffs!?... srsly... Frost mages are so OP in PvP atm that u would just like to kill urself... Haven't won a match agains frost mage in arena for ages... This stuff is getting so ridiculous that ppl are quitting wow and starting aion.... dont tell me u non-mages that u haven't thought about it...<br />
<br />
lol ur not going to like mages in Aion, polymorph so many seconds cant remember, sleep 30 seconds, freezes (alot of them) plus nukes that can kill you very quickly. And sure if you like grinding mobs for hours on end play aion, i'm on a break from wow atm playing aion and seriously i cant wait until the game time runs out soo boring only playin it coz i payed for it =) <br />
dont flame on my logic either lol</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naoto</div><div class="date">2009-10-17, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why are they going for the massive belts now? I liked them small but ever since totc they are all huge and ugly as hell, makes the tier look alot worse than it is with such a big ass belt covering up half your chest. So I guess alliance and horde have the same tier now instead of different ones like T9?</div></div><hr />
