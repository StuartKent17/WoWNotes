<br />
There can never be too many mounts...<br />
<br />
Besides, class mounts aren't THAT big of a deal. Ok, I can appreciate that they wanted to do them, but they come with some severe downsides, since:<br />
<br />
a. They're gonna be pretty common, to the point you're not gonna want to use them (I expect if your Class Hall allows mounts, they're gonna be the new Core Hounds for a while).<br />
b. They offer very little gameplay relative to how much work went in the models. If you don't have alts, the other mounts might as well not exist, and even if you do most of the chain is repeated content and over with fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
Why would they feel the need to cancel a Glory mount for this? It feels very counter intuitive, if not borderline idiotic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope it mean all legendaries but if not, one of my alt still got a 910 (I didn't play it much since last upgrade) so it mean I don't have to do the old quest or the new quest twice to get it to the new cap.</div></div><hr />

You might have miss the part I said &quot;I hope&quot; and I was explaining why the Dev would had said you only need 1 to upgrade your legendary sadly without &quot;s&quot;. But yeah, if you want to upgrade that #15 legendary that you never use, you will upgrade them until Argus if they go one at a time.</div></div><hr />

Only difference is that it will work on both 910 and 940, so you don't have to go 910-940-970 but can just do 910-970 in one go. Per item.</div></div><hr />

The team didn't want to do a mount this time, as class mounts were just unlocked. That sounds like the &quot;team&quot; is either lazy or just losing steam and they don't give two shits anymore...<br />
<br />
On top of that the Druid mount is flat out half assed with missing animations, it not counting as a mount for achievement purposes, or just being a separate &quot;form&quot; button.</div></div><hr />

Do you have evidence of this? They said you'll get 20 fragments of an essence from the weekly chest, which is the exact same as it was when 7.1.5 came out. Unless they start giving Essence fragments from every difficulty of raid (in which more casuals will bitch) or more from caches, or a non-timegated method like M+ drops, or from each world quest, then the impression is it will take a very long time to upgrade them, for no real reason. Honestly, outside of upgrading them all at one time after 1-2 weeks of collecting for the Essence, there is really no justification for any other way for this this to be done.</div></div><hr />

Except we have no proof that either Legionfall Army supplies turn-in chests or reputation chests will contain those essences.

-It was exclusive, as in gated behind some serious pet battling that not many people did. <br />
-Rewards were very cool, being able to pick a very cool and unique pet after winning it the first time, and then being able to pick the other 2/3 every couple of weeks. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, I have no interest in the new dungeons. Why? <br />
<br />
-Not very exclusive, it simply takes a large number of level 25 pets that anyone can buy from the AH. It is tedious vs. challenging (celestial tourney).<br />
-Rewards suck ass. Not only are there no exciting pet rewards (just bland reskins/old models with bland movesets), the rewards are RNG bullshit from boxes (opposed to working towards the 3 pets in the celestial tourney OVER TIME).<br />
<br />
Hopefully this can reach someone at Blizzard; don't give up on creating pet battle content due to lack of interest in the dungeons, simply make better and more fun dungeons.</div></div><hr />

It doesnt make any sense. I feel that my work to get all the class sets is just wasted. Sure you can call me special snowflake, but I loved that i could be recognized for my PvE effort, not my transmog skills. I sure wouldnt mind them re-adding the sets, just keep them obtainable from the same type of content...<br />
<br />
Uhhm why don't you instead of denying other people a cool armor sets, simply get yourself the challenging look from the current patch? The Artifact challenge weapon for example is currently pretty much locked to very skilled players or overgeared mythic raiders (which are skilled anyway).<br />
<br />

Class Mounts<br />
You will be able to go back and get your class mounts after Legion. ???? :O So IN legion we don`t get them??? :mad:<br />
<br />
Dude.. They are already in game.. I got mine yesterday.</div></div><hr />

You clearly haven't looked into Deadmines much, then. You get a bottle cap each week, and the three pets are bought with bottle caps. There's no more RNG in this Pet Dungeon.</div></div><hr />

Clearly you are assuming my comment is about the deadmines whenever it was clearly about the wailing caverns. Clearly you are just looking for an argument as clearly Blizzard changed exactly what I was complaining about. Nice to see they realized how bad it was.</div></div><hr />

If you have never done this run I suggest you plan ahead for about Mid October and put aside a Saturday evening and come join us for &quot;Running of the Gnomes&quot; on the Scarlet Crusade realm. Its best couple hours you'll ever have in the game.</div></div><hr />

There still is the unsub option , if enough of you do it you might get their attention .<br />
Because paying someone who does absolutely nothing for you is just nuts . Right ?</div></div><hr />

I will probably run one for transmog achieve (Glaives).</div></div><hr />

I've checked it on latest PTR build and upgrade system isn't even enabled there - I found exactly 0 essences from any source, so we can only speculate about legendaries upgrade rate at this time.<br />
<br />
So why spectate negatively? It makes more sense for the legionfall caches and bonus rep caches to work like emissarys do. <br />

That sounds like the &quot;team&quot; is either lazy or just losing steam and they don't give two shits anymore...<br />
<br />
On top of that the Druid mount is flat out half assed with missing animations, it not counting as a mount for achievement purposes, or just being a separate &quot;form&quot; button.<br />
<br />
Imho they fucked up pretty hard here, at least from the achievement perspective. Of the ones I am aware of...you have Druids who get nothing (and correct me if I'm wrong, lose their regular flight form), warriors and shaman who get 1, but it changes, bfd for warr..., you have warlocks who get 3 who already had a leg up on everyone but paladins and you even have rogues who have 4. <br />
<br />
I get that this isn't something that matters to many people, but to feel like my class choice alone is costing me 3+ of the X mounts i need for the achieve is shit, not to mention that those classes can CHOOSE which variation they want to use. I think the warrior one looks boring as fuck, but as a prot warrior, if i was to use it I would rather use the fury version over the purple pos prot one. Sigh, they need to &quot;balance&quot; this. sure it's a low prio item, but it's just about as mind boggling to have a seemingly random set of parameters for all classes as it is to have AP tokens that are instant, cast time, uninterruptible cast time, etc. Is the variation there just for the sake of it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not assuming anything. You're whining about how unfair the system is, when they've already corrected it for future Pet Dungeons.<br />
<br />
I'm looking to assuade your fears, not start an argument. There was no clarify in anything you talked about. You're posting on a Q+A about 7.2.5 information...<br />
<br />
You even talk about the new dungeons. Plural. That includes Deadmines.<br />
<br />
If anything, your clarity was in opposition to the point you poorly attempted to make, and then lashed out at me for.</div></div><hr />

Who said I dont have the challenge artifact appearance? I got it for my spec on the day it was available. Regardless, it got nothing to do with my comment.</div></div><hr />
