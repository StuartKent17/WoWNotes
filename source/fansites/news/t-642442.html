Patch 3.1 Mounts<br />
We did a recap of the companion pets yesterday, it's now time to list the mounts added in patch 3.1! Please note that the model of the Sea Turtle was changed since the last time I posted about it, it no longer looks like the TCG Turtle mount. Make sure to check the dedicated videos for the most impressive mounts. <br />

Confirmation window for talent respecs in 3.1<br />
It hasn't been widely publicized, but in 3.1 there is a UI option to not spend all of your talent points until you hit a &quot;Confirm&quot; button. Because you aren't actually spending the points, it is also really fast to add ranks or remove them. We default the tool off since having to confirm every single point you spend while leveling is kind of a drag. It's quite useful at level 80 though.

Tanking Ulduar Encounters<br />
Every fight in Ulduar has so far been tanked by all 4 tanking classes and we haven't seen any situations where one class is at such a disadvantage that they are in danger of losing their raid or guild spot. We'll continue to keep a close eye on it though and make sure that through some clever new mechanic or combination of gear that nobody manages to trivialize the encounter when tanking with a particular class. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/16137215472-we-love-gc.html))<br />
<br />
Multiple difficulty levels in instances - Elite Mode? <br />
That is kind of what we are trying to do with the hard modes in Ulduar. If they work out well, I could totally see selecting 3 or 4 difficulty levels when you zone in rather than just 10 vs. 25. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137184090-4-years-of-wow.html))<br />

The evolution of WoW players<br />
While we obviously disagree on WoW being dead, you make one point I wanted to echo which is that the average raider (or at least players interested in end-game content) are more sophisticated now. The game's community has matured as the game has matured. There are so many information sites out there with a great deal of depth. In the MC days, nobody had Deadly Boss Mobs or Omen (though we did have Decursive). You didn't link videos before your boss attempt. Half your group probably didn't know about the EJ website and there was no AJ. Players figured out what worked for them and focused less on optimization because there was no gigantic community out there advising them on how to optimize. I'm not saying that kind of community progression was a bad thing at all. But it definitely changes the experience. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137184090-4-years-of-wow.html))<br />
<br />
Balancing all specs to make them viable<br />
At a high level, you can design an RPG in two ways. You can have relatively few roles or you can have a lot of roles. However, even when you have a lot of roles, they tend to overlap a ton and have some very flimsy differences between some of the roles. So more realistically, you can have a few choices to fill your roles or a lot of choices to fill your roles.<br />
<br />
You could make a game like WoW with a tank, healer, and maybe a melee and ranged dps class. Four roles. Four classes. It would work.<br />
<br />
WoW however needs to last for a long time. It has already lasted a lot longer than many games, but because we have so many players, we need to keep designing a game to keep them interested. Adding new classes is one great way to do that. This time our class filled the tanking and dps role. Next time it might be a healer.<br />
<br />
When you say &quot;stop making every spec viable&quot; usually what you are really saying is &quot;let's have a game with less breadth and maybe more depth.&quot; That is definitely a way to design a game. But the breadth is also one of those things that provides options. To give just one example, if you get bored of your priest in WoW maybe you decide to roll up a warlock. Yeah you both use mana and wear cloth, but beyond that the classes start to diverge in what we hope are pretty interesting ways. If you have fewer specs or classes, then the reroll situation is a lot less compelling. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137364872-stop-making-every-spec-viable.html))<br />

Retribution before WotLK<br />
The problem with Ret was say a typical BC melee group had 2 rogues, a druid, a shaman and a warrior. (It could easily have 3 rogues too.) Yet the Ret needed all of those buffs to be decent. Stick the Ret with the casters, and the Ret buffs are wasted and the casters aren't helping her dps much. You could boot a rogue or maybe one of the others from the melee group, but your dps would likely still suffer. The old model was to bring the people to do the job (rogues in this case) and the people to buff them. Part of the move to having more raid buffs and fewer unique buffs was to solve this kind of jigsaw puzzle problem. The challenge should be fighting the bosses, not building the group in some kind of weird Tetris minigame. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137184090-4-years-of-wow.html))<br />

Totem Stomping Macros<br />
We don't like totem stomping macros and we are taking steps to prevent them. Because of technical limitations, these changes probably won't be in place for 3.1. But we will get them in place soon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16137225978-totem-stomping--why.html))</div></div><hr />

While Ghostcrawler is right that the playerbase is that educated, he is wrong if he thinks this applies to the majority. He really needs to step outside the hardcore PvE guilds.<br />
<br />
Each realm is made up of thousands of players. Each realm only has one or two guilds that are really PvE hardcore. The maths is quite easy.<br />
However people in the hardcore guild are more likely to post then thoses that are not.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying he shouldn't use expert opinions to try balance the game, but Ghostcrawler is spending all his time catering to these people he risks forgetting about the more average gamer.<br />
<br />
Example, there are a lot of roleplayers in this game and roleplaying is something that really brings life to the World of Warcraft. Yet there has never ever been a patch dedicated to improving the roleplaying experience of the game. Imagine what they could achieve if they really put some money into it? The roleplaying community itself has posted a lot of suggestions, its about time they started listening to that group of players.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying he shouldn't use expert opinions to try balance the game, but Ghostcrawler is spending all his time catering to these people he risks forgetting about the more average gamer.<br />

Example, there are a lot of roleplayers in this game and roleplaying is something that really brings life to the World of Warcraft. Yet there has never ever been a patch dedicated to improving the roleplaying experience of the game. Imagine what they could achieve if they really put some money into it? The roleplaying community itself has posted a lot of suggestions, its about time they started listening to that group of players.<br />

I would disagree. I'm in maybe the 15th or 20th best guild, horde side, on our server. We have 25+ regular raiders, and easily 30+ people that read EJ on a regular basis. Alliance side on our server is even more PVE-advanced. I would argue our server alone has 40+ guilds with many regular EJ readers, and 60+ that are doing Naxx regularly. <br />

I have never seen anyone role-play in WoW. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but... I would say that there are many more people stepping into raids than role-playing on a regular basis. Blizzard is made up of humans, and thus, they aren't perfect. However, if RP'ers made up that large a proportion of their player base we would have RP changes coming out our ears. They will address the audience that is spending the most money, that's how you stay in business and continue to grow the game- and at last announcement, WoW is still growing.

Here's the thing. The number one thing RPers need Blizz to do is - hold your breath - ENFORCING THE DAMN RP REALM RULES. No damnit, just throwing one GM out there that doesn't give a crap about RP on the realm won't work! How about a damn popup window on the realm select window that reminds you just where are you going? It has been suggested million times. How about ensuring that OOCers prance happily off on the regular realms? I rolled one for a reason, yet from the first glance at Dalaran it differs little from a regular realm (names, of course). Yes, I could sit all damn day and report them. And then be called an elitist.<br />
<br />
Another thing RPers need are tools to work with. RP is all about your imagination, but you need something to work with. For example, empty buildings. Simple, yet that is what we need. We don't need all kinds of stupid RL festival lookalike trinkets, that are implemented just for shits and giggles.<br />
<br />
So... what kind of blinking RP changes are you talking about? This isn't like PvP or PvE, where you can just patch the issues. You cannot patch creativity. You can only help to stimulate it, but with something simpler. Like enforcing the damn rules.</div></div><hr />

Getting 100 mounts is incredibly hard to get, especially if you don't hardcore PVE/PVP. My alt doesn't raid w/ my guild so I'm never gonna get the proto-drakes on him, so this is the next best thing.</div></div><hr />

From someone who doesn't RP at all, or even play on a RP server, I believe that if Blizz spent a bunch of time on this then people would understand. I've never seen anything in a patch notes for people on an RP realm. I don't see much of a difference between RP implementations and fishing achievements or extra mounts. It's all based on how you want to play the game, and for the people that enjoy RP it's a very important part of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizz has stated that each RP realm is left to enforce its own rules differently. In some RP realms, this means nothing beyond simply enforcing a rule against idiotic names.<br />
<br />
In others, this means that in certain cities, there is to be no screaming about in general or /say, as it's an in-character area.<br />
<br />
If Blizz began to universally enforce the same rules over different realms, they'd have a riot on their hands.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's not wrong at all. The information from those hardcore guilds has a trickle-down effect vastly larger than it did in Molten Core days, and those hardcore players are producing more solid and informative data about succeeding at the game than they did before.<br />
Even players who don't read EJ directly digest their data in the form of Wowhead/Thottbot comments on skills and items. They may not know X Skill is precisely a 3% dps increase, but they're far more educated about what makes a good talent build than people used to be.<br />
<br />
I would wager that players that do not use any form of external website for WoW information are in the vast minority - and those who do are exposed to much more theorycrafting and boss strats than the majority of MC players could ever hope to find.</div></div><hr />

Okay... this is something I am really passionate about and what has pissed me off greatly, so I apologise before hand, if I offend someone.<br />
<br />
Right... Riot? What riot? By who? OOCers? Guess what, THEY DON'T NEED TO BE THERE! I think I rolled on an RP server for a purpose - to get away from people like that. If Blizzard doesn't give a fuck about it, then OOCers won't either. Why? It's their 15$ a month, yadda yadda, you are no GM, yadda yadda, this is not your server and other copout excuses like that. Why? BECAUSE BLIZZARD DOES NOTHING TO ENFORCE THEIR RULES. So what am I left with? A report button? Cool, I can wait fucking hours for a goddamn GM to respond my ticket, and I give you a damn 90% probability that they will do fucking nothing about it.<br />
<br />
On an RP server, ALL OF IT is supposed to be IC in /say area. It says so in the damn rules. No exceptions. At all. Is that enforced? Hell no, and doubt it ever will, because it just has been let out of hand far too much. Without drastic measures, it won't change. Same should apply to general chat, though that is widely accepted as OOC and I am fine with that. But damnit, /s and /y should be IC.<br />
<br />
So excuse me, but how do I enforce the realm's rules? I mean, really. OOC is often regarded as something normal by many on my realm, and that truly pisses me off. How do I change this alone? And, let me be honest, it only goes worse. Many retards don't even know what RP STANDS FOR, for Christ's sake! They have zero clue where they are! Please don't tell me that is something normal and that I alone should deal with it somehow.<br />
<br />
And that's not all, not all GM's assigned to an RP realm even know what that really means. Which only makes the situation worse.<br />
<br />
So tell me now, what am I to do? Just suck it up? Reroll to a realm that has it better? Transfer my characters? Do you honestly believe that my, and many other roleplayer requests for Blizzard to ENFORCE THEIR OWN RULES is illegitimate? Do you honestly think that we should just shut up and stick with reporting stupid ass names? Really?</div></div><hr />

Woah, holy crap, slow down cowboy, nobody shot your horse.<br />
<br />
First off, Blizzard says the rules are DIFFERENT for every RP realm. Learn them for your given realm.<br />
Second, riot is a frickin' expression, I do not mean a thousand million fat roleplaying WoWtards are going to storm the Blizz headquarters with pitchforks, I simply mean the QQ would be considerable, jebus.<br />
Even bringing it up caused a QQstorm of Katrina-sized proportions from just you.<br />
<br />
There's more to add, I suppose: RP on WoW is, when compared to roleplay elsewhere, admittedly, about as casual as 'endgame' is in WoW, when compared to other MMOs. There are websites and chat client, games and forums where such things are rigorously enforced with draconian rules, and that framework is simply not conceivable to set up in WoW. Playing in an RP realm would become almost like playing a different game, under what you describe, and while Blizz can do some things to try to appease roleplayers, they can't really devote those kinds of resources to only a small portion of the total realms.</div></div><hr />

First off, Blizzard says the rules are DIFFERENT for every RP realm. Learn them for your given realm.<br />
<br />
Every time I log on my realm, I get a nice little system message on my chat window that is a link to the rules, like this - http://www.wow-europe.com/en/policy/roleplaying.html<br />
So where exactly are you getting that one from?<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh noes, I QQ about something that has pissed me off. How exactly I would cause a riot if the rules would be enforced? Also, cool generalization there, brah. Sadly, roleplaying takes a bit more grey matter and creative thinking than your average PvP or PvE experience, at least in Wrath, so the &quot;tard&quot; part is quite unappropriate.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's more to add, I suppose: RP on WoW is, when compared to roleplay elsewhere, admittedly, about as casual as 'endgame' is in WoW, when compared to other MMOs.<br />
<br />
How does this make RP lesser? Because it has smaller community? If both PvP and PvE is way more casual than in other MMOs, does this give Blizz some kind of cop-out excuse to let their hands slip in the RP part? If so, why did they even bring it in? Why half-ass something?<br />
<br />
<br />
There are websites and chat client, games and forums where such things are rigorously enforced with draconian rules, and that framework is simply not conceivable to set up in WoW.<br />
<br />
Why? I thought RP realms were made just for this purpose.<br />

<br />
Playing in an RP realm would become almost like playing a different game, under what you describe, and while Blizz can do some things to try to appease roleplayers, they can't really devote those kinds of resources to only a small portion of the total realms.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, why would you devote some more GMs that actually know what the fuck RP is about and assign them to RP servers? Maybe because that would make sense?<br />
<br />
See, I am not alone like this. There are more people just as pissed as me. I guess what divides us from the average PvP whiner is that we are used to this, and we have almost given up with words, because it doesn't seem to work. Blizz are listening, but they do not quite understand. In dev minds, it is small vanity pets and other useless silly stuff that makes RP, but damn it, that is far from truth.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daedalon</div><div class="date">2009-04-07, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading posts like these last ones from GC is becomes more and more aparent how washed down the game actually has become. <br />
<br />
The evolution of WOW players. I was there from day one. OFC things move on - ppl get skilled and those with skill pass their knowledge on. Hell - we would still be in stone age if not. But... If Blizzard really thinks that WOW in the current state will be keeping the &quot;mature comunity&quot; intrested - then they are totally wrong. 90% of the mature comunity is right now probably looking for their next MMO to play cause like hell they are gonna wait for BLizzard 6-8 months to release now content in 3-4 difficutly lvl ??? lol... how much testing will that call for ? Just stupid...<br />
<br />
Now as for balancing is conserned. I dont know if GC thinks he call fool the &quot;mature&quot; ppl into beliving one word he says. But one thing is for sure. Balancing in WOW is based on two diffrent games in one. PVE and PVP. Thing is... they are totally seperated if not for the &quot;small fact&quot; that character abilites changes effect both.... yes... nerfing one part of the game and you nerf the other to ... change one ability to &quot;balance&quot; and you change the same ability that will UNBALANCE the other aspect of the game... This is the main reason why Im not playing WOW anymore. This is not &quot;RPG&quot; balance. Cause RPG is not about destroying PVE abilites because of PVP - or vise versa. <br />
<br />
And finally - Just to support my earlier comments.. Lets go onto the retribution discussion... Ret paladins in TBC were not viable in PVE raiding. It had NOTHING to do with their dmg tho. It had to do with the fact that there were OTHER melee classes that had better and ESSENTIAL abilites in some fights - while ret paladins had NO essential abilites at all. Why did raids have 3 warriors and 2 rouges and melee shaman before even considering ret paladin ? Simple... because those classes had interupt. And even if ret palas were usefull in some fights they were totally useless as a close range melee class compared to those interuption classes.<br />
<br />
And about class roles... what does it tell you about class roles when Blizzard puts only 3 diffrent forum classes ? Im sorry but &quot;mature&quot; ppl kinda know what is going on.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigfooty</div><div class="date">2009-04-08, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About RP'ing i totally agree with Eversor.. If you make a character on a RP realm you are implicitly agreeing not to behave like a jerk like naming your character &quot;OMGRPSUXLOLLOL&quot;, trying at least to speak RP-ish, you know create a character and trying to live it.<br />
I have an alt on some RP realm i enjoy playing with once in a while, simply because i enjoy the intensity, the feeling you get when strolling down a street in silvermoon and people are sitting on benches talking, chasing each other, you know, making the game come alive. All that is destroyed when some jerk comes around and and screams &quot;OMG U FUCKING NOOBS GET A FUCKING LIFE LOL LOL LOL&quot; or just generally behaves non RP-ing, i mean why don't you just stay on your respective PvE/PvP realm and stick with that?? Its just like hackers who only hacks other peoples computers to be annoying.<br />
<br />
Of course GM's are also an issue and imo they rly should enhance RP laws and maybe make WoW itself a little more RP.<br />
They have done it a little with some factions when you increase your rep with them they go like &quot;Bigfooty is an officer and a gentleman&quot; and i find that funny! why can't a salesman from stormwind yell at a passing DK/lock simply because those clases kindda doesn't &quot;fit in&quot; in SW, shiver when they trade him. You know, those small details who are so easy to implement, yet so hard to come across.<br />
On the other hand, the salesman in question could bow at a paladin, and in UC you could reverse that, like making the UD salesman pat the locks back and being rude at a holy priest - it rly aint that hard!<br />
<br />
What i'm saying is: Improving RP environments rly shouldnt be that challenging, its rly only some small changes that wouldnt break anything for the PvE/PvP realms, but would make a huge difference for RP-guys<br />
Secondly GM's should be more responsible t'wards the RP realms and Herecius there rly ARE universal RP rules. That each RP realm prolly has tremendous differences in their specific lore is something entirely else.<br />

Balancing in WOW is based on two diffrent games in one. PVE and PVP. Thing is... they are totally seperated if not for the &quot;small fact&quot; that character abilites changes effect both.... yes... nerfing one part of the game and you nerf the other to ... change one ability to &quot;balance&quot; and you change the same ability that will UNBALANCE the other aspect of the game... This is the main reason why Im not playing WOW anymore. This is not &quot;RPG&quot; balance. Cause RPG is not about destroying PVE abilites because of PVP - or vise versa. <br />
<br />
And finally - Just to support my earlier comments.. Lets go onto the retribution discussion... Ret paladins in TBC were not viable in PVE raiding. It had NOTHING to do with their dmg tho. It had to do with the fact that there were OTHER melee classes that had better and ESSENTIAL abilites in some fights - while ret paladins had NO essential abilites at all. Why did raids have 3 warriors and 2 rouges and melee shaman before even considering ret paladin ? Simple... because those classes had interupt. And even if ret palas were usefull in some fights they were totally useless as a close range melee class compared to those interuption classes.<br />
<br />
And about class roles... what does it tell you about class roles when Blizzard puts only 3 diffrent forum classes ? Im sorry but &quot;mature&quot; ppl kinda know what is going on.<br />

I totally agree with Daedalon... this game is being rapidly 'destroyed' by invalid ideas of balancing PVE/PVP/classes - as Daedalon has pointed out - it is two totally separate aspect of the game (PVE and PVP). The thrill and fun of playing 'unique' classes with 'unique&quot; abilities is gone. Most if not all of my WoW &quot;mature&quot; buddies feel the same and many have started to move to other MMO options. I hope Blizzard management will run a survey with the 'mature' players and find out the reality instead of relying on a bunch of programmers to decide the fate of the game. Give us back the good-old 'WoW' please.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I also agree that WoW was fun back then, because of these uniqueness. But it is &quot;game-breaking&quot; to stack one class just to do a certain boss. Some guilds don't have this luxury of having enough of each class.</div></div><hr />

If you make a character on a RP realm you are implicitly agreeing not to behave like a jerk like naming your character &quot;OMGRPSUXLOLLOL&quot;, trying at least to speak RP-ish, you know create a character and trying to live it.<br />
I have an alt on some RP realm i enjoy playing with once in a while, simply because i enjoy the intensity, the feeling you get when strolling down a street in silvermoon and people are sitting on benches talking, chasing each other, you know, making the game come alive. All that is destroyed when some jerk comes around and and screams &quot;OMG U FUCKING NOOBS GET A FUCKING LIFE LOL LOL LOL&quot; or just generally behaves non RP-ing, i mean why don't you just stay on your respective PvE/PvP realm and stick with that?? Its just like hackers who only hacks other peoples computers to be annoying.<br />
<br />
Of course GM's are also an issue and imo they rly should enhance RP laws and maybe make WoW itself a little more RP.<br />
They have done it a little with some factions when you increase your rep with them they go like &quot;Bigfooty is an officer and a gentleman&quot; and i find that funny! why can't a salesman from stormwind yell at a passing DK/lock simply because those clases kindda doesn't &quot;fit in&quot; in SW, shiver when they trade him. You know, those small details who are so easy to implement, yet so hard to come across.<br />
On the other hand, the salesman in question could bow at a paladin, and in UC you could reverse that, like making the UD salesman pat the locks back and being rude at a holy priest - it rly aint that hard!<br />
<br />
What i'm saying is: Improving RP environments rly shouldnt be that challenging, its rly only some small changes that wouldnt break anything for the PvE/PvP realms, but would make a huge difference for RP-guys<br />
Secondly GM's should be more responsible t'wards the RP realms and Herecius there rly ARE universal RP rules. That each RP realm prolly has tremendous differences in their specific lore is something entirely else.<br />

I was on an rp server for over a year and I saw people rp'ing like.... 3 times? Not sure what one you are on, but I never see rp on an rp server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's essentially a collection of daily quests built around a 'duel' type mounted combat they've slapped together using vehicle mechanics. It's a jousting tournament and ren faire - nothing to do with WoW Arena at all.</div></div><hr />

Don't tell me is so, or I go shot myself... Really, I didn't even think that they won't make such that after you play around with all unconfirmed talent points you can select &quot;Confirm&quot; or &quot;Rollback&quot; to the last confirmed state of your talent tree. Let's say that if you confirmed 20 points, and you want to spend the rest of the points, you start adding the talent points being able to remove all added talent points just like websites talent builders do, and when you are done, you can't exit the talent builder window, unless you confirm or roll back the points that you just put. Maybe I understood it wrong, please someone say how is now on the PTR?</div></div><hr />

So where exactly are you getting that one from?<br />
<br />
Oh noes, I QQ about something that has pissed me off. How exactly I would cause a riot if the rules would be enforced? Also, cool generalization there, brah. Sadly, roleplaying takes a bit more grey matter and creative thinking than your average PvP or PvE experience, at least in Wrath, so the &quot;tard&quot; part is quite unappropriate.<br />
<br />
How does this make RP lesser? Because it has smaller community? If both PvP and PvE is way more casual than in other MMOs, does this give Blizz some kind of cop-out excuse to let their hands slip in the RP part? If so, why did they even bring it in? Why half-ass something?<br />
<br />
Why? I thought RP realms were made just for this purpose.<br />
<br />
Yes, why would you devote some more GMs that actually know what the fuck RP is about and assign them to RP servers? Maybe because that would make sense?<br />
<br />
See, I am not alone like this. There are more people just as pissed as me. I guess what divides us from the average PvP whiner is that we are used to this, and we have almost given up with words, because it doesn't seem to work. Blizz are listening, but they do not quite understand. In dev minds, it is small vanity pets and other useless silly stuff that makes RP, but damn it, that is far from truth.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Detailed below is the language policy enforced on the Role Play realms. Use of the /ignore command is also highly encouraged. &quot;<br />
<br />
In addition, I'm just wondering, why does it bother you so much that people aren't RP'ing?</div></div><hr />

Last few days nothing excited has been posted here. Gues 3.1 is about to get released next week, since there is nothing left to test. And they didnt even give Survival Hunters something nice in pvp to counter all the nerfs. Wouldnt be bad if Survival would actually get something like.. Survivabilty? Whats 4k crits gonna help if u drop in less then 5 seconds.<br />

Gz on totem stomping macros removal though. Now i can finally start playing with a Shaman in S6 as MM. Next faceroll combo inc.</div></div><hr />

Ignore list has a limited amount of names I can put in there. Ignoring also solves nothing. At all. It only delays the consequences.<br />
<br />
What bothers me are people who deliberately roll on an RP server and don't RP (I can stand those who don't RP, but follow the policy, however even then that is walking on a thin ice). I mean... you have hundred servers! Why choose the few damn RP ones, if you don't intend to RP? Why not just roll a regular one? THAT is what pisses me off. Often enough, some tard jumping around, spamming /lol or other crap like that is sufficient to ruin my mood. Why should I be harassed for what am I doing on a server that is dedicated to that? And no, reporting it is not enough. Rules are there to prevent such behavior. But if they are not enforced by Blizzard, then they can be ignored.</div></div><hr />

Well maybe i have just been lucky, but you just enhanced my point: why roll an RP server if you aren't intending to<br />

An immediate (however not a permanent) solution: Download the addon ignoremore:)</div></div><hr />
