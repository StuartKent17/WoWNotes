<br />
Agreed, this is a fantastic change.<br />
<br />
Glad the belt rep is dropping--ran out of valor items to buy too quickly (thanks to item upgrades being unavailable).<br />
<br />
Glad about the lesser marks--90 is just stupid.<br />

<br />
Healing tide is already way better than divine hymn and tranq since it scales with haste and gets extra ticks while tranq and hymn don't. This change merely brings those 2 cds on par with healing tide since the change doesn't apply to healing tide by looking at the patch notes.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The following trinkets have on-use effects reduced by 33%, but have a 100% increase to duration when used in a Battleground or Arena.&quot;<br />
The way I understand it&gt;<br />
The &quot;on use&quot; is probably meant as the proc.<br />
The reduction of effectivity and increase in duration is meant for BG and Arena as a whole, or is it blanket proc effectivity reduction by 33%, BUT increased duration in BG/Arena?</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 days /played or two days your time? because not everyone can play the game all day and night and level in two real life days. <br />
<br />
this is nice, along with the rep changes, but I'd still like to see valor turned to honor, or make honor useful for something other than BoAs. change ethereal shards into being bought with justice points and make sha shards bought with spirits or something.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The following trinkets have on-use effects reduced by 33%, but have a 100% increase to duration when used in a Battleground or Arena.&quot;<br />
The way I understand it&gt;<br />
The &quot;on use&quot; is probably meant as the proc.<br />
The reduction of effectivity and increase in duration is meant for BG and Arena as a whole, or is it blanket proc effectivity reduction by 33%, BUT increased duration in BG/Arena?<br />
<br />
Not much to explain, they were to spiky for pvp. This change doesn't change much for pve but evens things out for pvp. You'll get the same benefit overall but not all at once.</div></div><hr />

Even though some of them (Besides tranq and WM) are small 60 second CD on Ironbark while fun isn't that big a deal and 2 more yards for efflorescence is nothing considering you either put it on the tank or melee 90% of the time its still gonna hit the same people for the same amount.<br />
Tranq is obviously great and WM needed its healing increased even after the Rejuv change it still wasnt worth the hassle. &lt;3 atonement nerfs</div></div><hr />

<br />
Charms: I have exalted rep with all mop factions, doing dailies feel not so rewarding then, and now I will just have to do the IoT dailies twice a week and I get enough charms (30 per day for pve dailies) for the Mogu runes! Also a friend of mine stopped playing recently because he did not want to play nearly every day to get the charms.<br />
<br />
Experience: I have nothing against this, I have 3 90's was enjoyable the first time, the two other times it feels pretty painful:p<br />
<br />
Also the AoE healing buffs for 25-man looks really good.</div></div><hr />

20 max level characters; one of each class on both factions. The first 10 were a breeze, but the by time I was in the 50s on the second set I hated the world.</div></div><hr />

'Revival now has a healing cap of 15 raid members (up from 6) when used in a 25-player instance.'<br />
Can someone clarify what this means, does it mean it will diminish less (because of the 6---&gt;15) making it heal overall more in 25's? :S<br />
<br />
I would say, yes. Though im not sure till i test it out of course. It wouldn't make sense if it had the same rate of diminishing returns.</div></div><hr />

Well to be fair most ppl have jobs/family and other commitments that limit their playing time. What takes you 2 FULL days of playing takes the rest of us weeks.</div></div><hr />

We resto shammys are the owners of some of the BEST AoE heals in the game. They don't get much more proper than what they are already.</div></div><hr />
