Weekly Bonus Event - Battlegrounds<br />
A new weekly quest and rewards are here—steel yourself for Battleground combat!<br />
<br />
Seven Days on the Battlegrounds<br />
All this week, heading to the Battlegrounds will net you some extra Honor along with bonus loot for completing this week’s quest. To enter the fray, open Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select the Player vs. Player tab. Next choose Casual, select Random Battlegrounds, and hit the Join Battle button—you’ll be matched up with other players and sent to one of the 11 battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
Weekly Quest<br />
Before you get started, Archmage Timear (http://wwws.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest for you (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/44173-a-call-to-battle). Win four random Battlegrounds, and you’ll be rewarded with 5 Marks of Honor, a Badge of Honor (1000 Honor), and a Glory of the Melee Artifact Power token (base 500 AP).<br />
<br />
Battleground Buff<br />
This week you gain 50% more Honor in Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
A New Event Every Week<br />
The Bonus Events system consists of a rotating schedule of different activities, currently scheduled to run each week beginning on Tuesdays. Each Bonus Event grants a passive bonus to a particular game activity and offers a once-per-event quest with a noteworthy reward for accomplishing a related goal. The in-game calendar can serve as your one-stop reference for the event schedule. The Adventure Guide also offers a direct link to active Bonus Events, allowing you to easily accept any associated quests.</div></div><hr />

Hehe...I always wondered why people still cry about that. Ever since I raided MC and pretty much every mob was a mob we had already encountered as a trivial mob while levelling. And then 5 (?) snake bosses, some of them with snake buddies. In a bland cave. With lava</div></div><hr />

The in-game Human female faces already do, since WoD.</div></div><hr />

Would need too much time from developers to fix. Valuable time that they could spend on cashgrab-mounts/pets instead :)<br />

WIsh they would offer 2 weekly bonuses each reset and we can choose - so that those of us who aren't good at PvP (or plain suck at it like me) can still do something that gives me a bonus that week instead of piddlefarting around with other toons.<br />
<br />
Sort of like the shitty weekly bonuses that are 5000 order resources from 20 world quests and the pet battle one. Literally the most boring weeklys ever...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracullus</div><div class="date">2018-04-10, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Too bad we don't have more info about BfA Prestige. We know that it will be account wide, we know that we will be able to grab Legion rewards, but we don't know if our Legion Prestige progress will be erased or not (and I'm not sure if even devs knows about it at this point). So doing any PVP right now may get me closer to my goal (obtaining all artifact skins for all classes) or huge waste of time.<br />

<br />
Of course, same people design new mounts and tweak numbers in the game.<br />
<br />
...actually, that would explain first 1-2 days of 7.2 ;P.</div></div><hr />
