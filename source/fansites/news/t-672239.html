Patch 3.3 Instance Screenshots (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/patch-3-3-instance-screenshots/)<br />
<br />
All across the lands of Northrend, many battles have been fought against the vile Scourge. Countless lives have been lost since the Alliance and Horde first reached the frozen wastes, but the champions of Azeroth continue to march forward. Now Icecrown Citadel, the cornerstone of the Scourge's power and the home base of the Lich King, is their final target. Tirion Fordring and the Argent Crusade have forged an alliance with Darion Mograine and the Knights of the Ebon Blade to form the Ashen Verdict. The strongest combatants of this coalition, along with the champions of the Alliance and Horde, will lead the charge against the citadel. <br />
<br />
This dungeon reveals the culminating story events and battles of the Wrath of the Lich King expansion pack. Join the legendary heroes Highlord Tirion Fordring, High Overlord Saurfang, Muradin Bronzebeard, Highlord Darion Mograine, and King Varian Wrynn in an epic battle against the Scourge and their master. Icecrown Citadel features 10- and 25-player versions of the raid dungeon, and each version has 12 encounters. Each encounter can be fought in either normal or Heroic mode, and players can use a new user interface feature to toggle easily between difficulties. The rewards in the raid dungeon start at item level 251 in the normal mode with 10-player encounters, increase to item level 264 in the Heroic mode mode with 10 players and the normal mode with 25-player encounters, and then finally reach item level 277 in the Heroic mode with 25 players. <br />
<br />
Grand Entrance of the Citadel<br />
After breaching the fortress, players will face a legion of undead guards directed to repel any invaders. Commanding the defenders is Lord Marrowgar, a monstrosity fused together from the bones of the undead. Supreme Overseer of the Cult of the Damned, Lady Deathwhisper is the next opponent. She bolsters the faith of her followers by promising them the opportunity to give eternal service in undeath.<br />
<br />
As they continue their ascent, the Alliance and Horde heroes ultimately end up outside of the citadel where their hatred for one another erupts into a battle for dominance over the Rampart of Skulls. Players will join in battle alongside High Overlord Saurfang on the Orgrim's Hammer gunship or Muradin Bronzebeard on The Skybreaker in a unique encounter. Each faction will protect its gunship and try to destroy the other one in a back-and-forth battle to see who is truly worthy of facing the Lich King.<br />
<br />
The Lich King's most powerful death knight then stands as the final obstacle for the heroes to enter the upper reaches of the citadel.<br />
<br />
The Wings of Icecrown Citadel<br />
After the heroes of the Alliance or Horde defeat the other faction on the gunships and wipe out the creatures near the entrance, players will venture into an area with three separate wings. Here they will face a multitude of terrors that must be vanquished in order to confront the Lich King.<br />
<br />
In the Frostwing Halls players will battle alongside the Ashen Verdict and push into the lair of the deadly frost wyrm Sindragosa, who continues to strengthen her brood with the help of Ymirheim's vrykul. Along the way, the heroes will stumble upon Valithria Dreamwalker, a captured green dragon whom the Scourge is using as a test subject for their own ends....<br />
<br />
The Plagueworks contains the most twisted experiments ever produced by the Scourge. In this wing players will face two new forms of abomination in Festergut and Rotface, who currently protect their devious creator, Professor Putricide.<br />
<br />
The Crimson Hall contains the leaders of the San'layn, undead blood elves who oversee the Scourge's operations throughout Azeroth. The blood-princes Valanar, Keleseth, and Taldaram were raised into undeath by the Lich King to avenge themselves while protecting their blood-queen, Lana'thel.<br />
<br />
The Frozen Throne<br />
After clearing all three wings, players will ascend to the Frozen Throne, where the Lich King and his runeblade, Frostmourne, await to deliver them to their deaths....<br />
<br />

Just because they don't mention Mal'ganis it doesn't mean he won't be there. Back in BT we met Maiev imprisoned, and then they didn't mention her after, then she suddenly appeared at the big showdown. You know blizzard, they have perfectly set up the Mal'ganis line in Icecrown already, he will be there in one way or another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I don't like the Ulduar Hard Mode System they are reintroducing. So you have to choose if you want to kill the boss in heroic or normal mode and can't beat both versions, which for me as a raidleader means I have to plan if we directly try the heroic versions or just farm the normal mode bosses. Hopefully the PTR will give a good impression about the difficulty level.</div></div><hr />

And now Blizz introduce dogfight (still don't get how the skybreaker floats in the air, gnome powar maybe) where we have to fight with each other in lich king's own realm. Heck, I don't want to fight Muradin or Saurfang, none of them is my enemy, Arthas is. why shouldn't alliance and horde unite, fly to the frozen throne peak and bomb the shit out of the lich kings instead of killing each other?<br />

She and Jaina are going to be in the 5 man dungeons. I get the impression that, story-wise, the 5 man dungeons take place before the raid. Considering that Blizz has promised that the 5 man dungeons will be &quot;epic&quot; and considering the lack of sylvanas and jaina in the raid to finally stop Arthas, I'd be very surprised if Sylvanas and Jaina come out of the 5 man dungeons alive...</div></div><hr />

No its not:<br />
<br />
Each encounter can be fought in either normal or Heroic mode, and players can use a new user interface feature to toggle easily between difficulties.<br />
Bolded for emphasis. It would appear they are using the heroic mode selector added with ToC to change difficulty however it is still the ulduar system of choosing between hard and normal mode.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, i would actually like this. cause ever since WotLK, you could only get rep with factions by wearing a tabard in certain heroics. IF they put in a new faction that could only be earned by doign a FEW outside quests and killing mobs in the 3 new 5-mans and more rep per kill in the Raid, i think it would be very cool....kinda like the vanilla WoW raids :P</div></div><hr />

Not what the rest of the paragraph says:<br />
<br />
<br />
The rewards in the raid dungeon start at item level 251 in the normal mode with 10-player encounters, increase to item level 264 in the Heroic mode mode with 10 players and the normal mode with 25-player encounters, and then finally reach item level 277 in the Heroic mode with 25 players.<br />

But see I don't see them going in with the same purpose. Sylvanas and Muradin both want revenge and imo should both have a chance at it, whereas jaina just wants a last chance at redeeming arthas.

I honestly can't see how that would work, since the mobs are seeded when someone enters the instance, reason why the created the normal and heroic mode instances.<br />

Like I said on other thread, the 5 man is the &quot;soul&quot; part of the Lich King, Arthas. The 10/25 is about the Scourge and the entity Lich King, not about revenges but about destroying this army that threathens everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was confirmed at Blizzcon 2009 that he will be a raid boss in Icecrown. As reported on worldofraids.com liveblog of Blizzcon 2009,<br />
<br />
Saurfang will be an encounter in Icecrown, as will Bolvar. We asked what happened to Bolvar at the fansite summit and one of the gameplay programmers grinned and said &quot;well, his body isn't there, right?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Jaina and Sylvannas both are in the 5man and help you fight Arthas there, and then midway through the LK10/25 version of the fight in ICC they will join in for their own different reasons. Jaina's old flame and Sylvannas's revenge, however both die during the encounter OR both die in the 5man version hence why they not in the 10/25.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, the &quot;was merely a setback&quot; joke doesn't really work when the enemy is an army of the undead, with powerful necromancers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People who only started the game with WoTLK yea.<br />

I personally don't know a single person who raided in Vanilla or TBC that thought Ulduar is the best raid ever made.<br />
<br />
I don't think you do either ;)<br />
<br />
BWL, Naxx 60, AQ40, BT and SWP i think were all more epic in feeling and playstyle than Ulduar. Heck even Karazhan at 70 had more of an epic feeling than Ulduar if you had raided it when it first came out.<br />
<br />
I'm quite certain most people would have at least one of these they think were better than Ulduar had they raided at 60 and/or 70.</div></div><hr />

A few people have said this makes no sense and is stupid, but blizz is going to start getting wow ready for cat in 3.3 and we obviously know horde and alliance will not be getting along too in the next xpac.

i dont want same encounters with just bigger numbers, e.g. bosses just hits harder. Make heroic modes exciting like Ulduar/Sarth3D with new aspects of the fight and not like HC modes as fail ToC.<br />
<br />

You clearly have not done ToC Hard Modes because they are not just the same fights with boss's that have more HP. Similar yes but the same not even close.</div></div><hr />

Each encounter can be fought in either normal or Heroic mode, and players can use a new user interface feature to toggle easily between difficulties.<br />
<br />
They need to combine the Normal vs. Heroic system. We need to be able to toggle between two options while inside the instance. If we kill a mob on Normal mode inside the Raid, and we want to do that mob again on Heroic Mode, we should be able to toggle it and do it. If we want to go back to it after killing Normal Mode, we should be able to. Granted that would allow people to kill all the Normal bosses, then go back for their pick at the Heroic Mode bosses, but ANYTHING is better than the crap we have now. Ulduar's system was soooooo bad. Making a decision to skip a Heroic mode sucks, because you have to wait a week to try it. <br />

Morgraine &quot;was the finest warrior that the Death Knights had ever seen.&quot; <br />
Morgraine disappeared from Naxxramas. (he probably got called to defend the Icecrown after Tirion claimed the Ashbringer, so we get the &quot;old&quot; Ashbringer vs the Wielder of the Ashbringer)<br />

As for the greatest deathknight, my bet would be on Bolvar/Saurfang JR. (Depending on your faction), and Saurfang senior will most die showing mercy to his son. <br />
<br />
Mal'Ganis will probably come in on the Arthas fight, along with all the heroes. Hopefully we'll also see some people Arthas has killed (King Terenas, Saurfang, the dead Mograines, and others, just a general rise of the people he's butchered) and of course the heroes who are alive still (Namely Tirion).

Well, if the blood-princes and thier queen are a single encounter, and if Festergut and Rotface are also a single encounter (Twin Emperors, anyone?), then that would make room for 2 more bosses.

The unnamed DK could also very well be Saurfang or Bolvar.

<br />
No, this will probably be the ToC system again, maybe with shared locks (to avoid farming).<br />
I don't necessarily think it will be that hard. Just consider some of the Ulduar bosses that get buffs. Then the encounter could be scrpited with &quot;if boss has buff then&quot; type stuff and would work fine. I think the message from ToC was clear. 4 lock outs for 1 instance is too many.<br />
<br />
<br />
People who only started the game with WoTLK yea.<br />
<br />
I personally don't know a single person who raided in Vanilla or TBC that thought Ulduar is the best raid ever made.<br />
<br />
I don't think you do either ;)<br />
<br />
BWL, Naxx 60, AQ40, BT and SWP i think were all more epic in feeling and playstyle than Ulduar. Heck even Karazhan at 70 had more of an epic feeling than Ulduar if you had raided it when it first came out.<br />
<br />
I'm quite certain most people would have at least one of these they think were better than Ulduar had they raided at 60 and/or 70.<br />
I raided Vanilla and BC and found Ulduar to be the most enjoyable overall of the raids. Just because you think you speak for the majority, doesn't mean you actually do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Lich King took Suarfang Jr's Soul at the Wrathgate event...<br />
Suarfangs body was destroyed by the red dragonflight...<br />
<br />
Bolvars body was taken by Arthas (thus, only his sheild was left after the event, and blizz wanted us to notice this as they made the dragonqueen ask us to pick up the sheild... which was pretty pointless)<br />
<br />
put 2 and 2 together = suarfangs soul inside bolvars body (good old origional DK, orcs soul in human body)<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, the greatest DK ever does refer to Alexadros Mograine.... and the fact the Lich King took his soul at the lights hope chapel event during the DK starter quests (&quot;Touching.. Your Mine Now&quot;...*arthas takes his soul into frostmourne*)... and he randomly went missing from Naxx 40. This would point to him being the DK boss.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
It could go either way, I personally think mograine is the DK boss and the bolvar/suarfang boss will be part of the arthas fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When?<br />
<br />
Arthas retreats away from the plague while Bolvar is still alive. Then he talks for a bit, then he dies and the dragons set everything on fire.<br />
<br />
Bolvar and Saurfang's corpses are both burnt up.<br />
<br />
If somehow their bodies appear in ICC, it's a pretty big oversight on Blizzard's part.</div></div><hr />

Alextrasza:[Dragonic] They must not learn the fate of the Paladin (or somehting like that)... andd in Yoggs vision we see an Immolated champion, which is Bolvar, and a Turned Champion which is Suarfang.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems that because he's in Arthas's body, everyone forgets that the Lich King's soul is half orc...<br />
<br />
<br />
If Blizzard follows their own books, Ner'zhul is gone. But also Arthas. Only the bastard Arthas, AKA the Lich King, is left.<br />
<br />
That's what probably the 5 man will deal with, we are going to learn about how the Lich King and the Frostmourne works, with Jaina still hoping to see good Arthas and Sylvanas going for revenge.<br />
<br />
Obviously they don't stop him, but the juicy persona stuff is dealt in the 5 man. The raid is about the grand game, ending with the Lich King and the Scourge once and for all.<br />
<br />
At least it's how I see the story progression so far.</div></div><hr />

Just consider some of the Ulduar bosses that get buffs. Then the encounter could be scrpited with &quot;if boss has buff then&quot; type stuff and would work fine. I think the message from ToC was clear. 4 lock outs for 1 instance is too many.<br />
<br />
Well, probably they are implement some new tech to change the instance mobs on-the-fly. Because ToC system appeared because it wasn't possible to respawn on mobs/bosses once the instance was seeded.<br />
<br />
Ulduar is different, since involve coding triggers for trigger (redundecy, I know :P) the hardmode. Like &quot;not destroying the towers&quot; or &quot;push the red button&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Definitely seeing Terenas. MMOC posted an image showing him and his unique model they made.<br />

I've been waiting for him for forever. Can't wait to see how this plays out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmmmmm <br />
<br />
the battle starts we fight the Lich King alone we deal some damage to him lets say 10% he laughs us off casts some uber spell we all &quot;die&quot; he has a speech then<br />
<br />
Darion Morgraine and Tirion Fordring arrive. Tirion casts mass ressurect on the raid we get some raid buffs and go back into the fight. Lich King has new powers.<br />
<br />
We get the Lich King down to something like 60% an epic cutscene of Darion and Morgraine dueling the Lich King. Morgraine gets bitch slapped away and Tirion and the Lich King begin to go at it. Ultimatly Tirion falls to the Lich King. The Lich King gets all speechie in triumph. Darion rises and charges the Lich King again and well he gets pwned. However we get a scene with the Alexandros Morgraine appearing talking to Darion and ultimatly Darion takes up the Ashbringer and is able to wield the purefied Ashbringer. Surprising the Lich King but he simply rebuffs him and the battle is about to begin again. <br />
<br />
A portal opens up and Mal'Ganis steps out saying he has recovered his full strength from the Legion homeworld and its time to finish this Arthas. He says that for the time being he'll ally himself to us mortal worms and the battle begins again.<br />
<br />
We continue to battle the Lich King gets to 30% and now he's royally pissed off. So he he calls forth his most trusted lieutenants. &quot;Minions servants Soldiers of the Cold dark obey the call of Kel'Thuzad!&quot; <br />
<br />
Thats right Kel'Thuzad appears to aid the Lich King.<br />
<br />
“&quot;I am Dar'Khan, a gentle soul by nature...so you should know that what I do, I do by necessity!” ayep Dar’Khan appears this time with his hat cuse everyone knows Dar’Khan is nothing without that awsome hat.<br />
<br />
I don’t have quotes for them so fuck it Pai Stormbringer and Ul’haik Hadanot appear as well. Their the mortal co-leaders of the cult of the damned <br />
The true leader of the San’laryn Prince Theraldis shows up to.<br />
<br />
So the Lich King has gathered his most powerful lieutenants and... yep we all get killed and ressurected into our blessed lord the Lich King’s grand army.<br />
<br />
Ayep best ending ever</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally disagree with you, Wrathgate Draconic text, the scene from Yogg Saron fight are 2 examples that there is story yet to tell about these 2 in this instance, Blizzard have been teasing us to much about it to not be in my view.<br />
Also I think we will see Morgraine again, maybe he is the source of the Legendary Axe drop. It would make some sense for old Litchie to make something to try slowing down Tirion and the ashbringer.<br />
<br />
All I know is that that final fight no mater the out come with old Litchie will be something I will always treasure in my time playing World of Warcraft :)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
Timeline baby, timeline.<br />
Yes, the dragons burn the plague away, but that could be 5 seconds after Bolvar &quot;dies&quot; or 5 hours.<br />
Even if its just 5minutes later it could still be more then enough time for Arthas to either pickup the corpses himself or have someone do it for him.<br />
You never found em, only the gear pieces (Which btw didnt burn either) and one could assume that the corpses burned away yeah, but there is no actuall proof of that.<br />
Nothing to do with an oversight, if you would see Arthas take the corpses in it would be sure something would happen, if you actually saw the corpses burn or there be a note in an npc text saying the corpses got destroyed by the dragons there would be very little options to go with right?<br />
<br />
Regardless of if its intended or not or just plain luck on their part, the past several days/weeks this and other fansites have been discussing Wrathgate and whatever would come as a result of it. Mainly based upon speculation and possible routes that the story could go with.<br />
If they had something happen to the corpses, as stated above, the possible options would be very limited and thus any discussion on the matter would be less interesting. People are already debating 3.3 as if its release week already while no none blizzard employee has even entered ICC yet.<br />
Thats the type of hype you want to create for a final patch for an expansion, so as said, whether its plain luck or planned, their current strategy is creating a whole lot of attention to something thats atleast 2-3 months away.</div></div><hr />

He does have Saurfang's soul (Wrathgate video shows it) and he can easily raise Bolvar's scorched body and infuse Saurfang's soul in it. It would come full circle, the Last Death Knight being created just like the First Death Knight, Teron Gorefiend.<br />
<br />
By the way, it seems it's confirmed, Bornakk just posted saying that the current plan is 2 raid ID lockouts, though might change. Looks like they are indeed trying some new instance mode changing tech.</div></div><hr />

Bornakk: &quot;Assuming everything goes as planned, you can switch it back and forth as much as you like. Encounter 1 on hard, 2 on normal, 3 on hard, 4 on normal, etc.<br />
<br />
In effect it works out similar to Ulduar but it's with a much more clear method in the UI as opposed to the fairly confusing process of figuring out some encounter mechanics just to activate it.&quot;<br />

I like this suggestion. It actually makes amazing sense. The only problem I see with it is it points to one of those &quot;redemption&quot; scenarios which may or may not have been off the cards since Tyrion took a large sword to Arthas' heart in that IC quest chain of old. <br />

if there is actually any skill needed for these hardmodes (unlike loltoc except anub 25 heroic), then you are totally right.<br />

Yeah, Mal'Ganis really isn't dead. Did a similar thing to Balnazzar, his &quot;brother&quot;. Ever done the Scarlet section of present-day Stratholme? Grand Crusader Dathrohan was in fact killed a good while ago and possessed by the Dreadlord Balnazzar. Mal'Ganis survived his encounter with Arthas in Northrend and possessed the unfortunate Grand Admiral Barean Westwind on the Scarlet Fleet's &quot;disastrous expedition to Northrend&quot; some years back. You discover this after being tasked by the Ebon Blade to kill the Admiral once and for all - he shows his true form mid-fight and then buggers off to the Legion Homeworld to recover his strength and forces.<br />
<br />
How dumb can those Scarlets get, huh? Duped TWICE by a Dreadlord possessing the body of one of their highest ranked commanders.<br />
<br />
Anyway! Epic new raid is epic. I get the Black Temple vibe in terms of size and scope, though it seems much less trash (Ulduar-sized packs, methinks) and of course the ability to teleport around like Ulduar to save time. I'd sort of welcome the possibility of a raid-based rep grind for a new faction. I actually enjoyed that about Black Temple and Mount Hyjal back in TBC. Looking forward to the scripted events more than anything, to be quite honest. Such a Lore fanatic for the Warcraft series. And yeah.. I did make an account just to reply to this thread. But oh well.

Well...to be fair, that is a easy outlook coming from someone who is playing the game...<br />

Now from the point of view of the characters, these races have been at one anothers throats for years now and I bet the Wraithgate is still fresh in mind...<br />

you can expect for them to put away their feelings of mistrust, hatred, and racism just because they have a common enemy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bretac</div><div class="date">2009-10-07, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">- Jaina and/or Sylvanas may die. If not, they may be in final boss fight.<br />
<br />
- Mal'Ganis may be in final boss fight.<br />
<br />
- Saurfang + Horde Raid Force vs. Death Knight Saurfang Jr.<br />
<br />
- Varian + Alliance Raid Force vs. Death Knight Bolvar<br />
<br />
- Varian &amp; Alliance/Saurfang &amp; Horde vs. Evil F*cking Hybrid of Saurfang Jr. and Bolvar<br />
<br />
- Whats Left of Highlord Alexandros Mograine vs. Alliance or Horde and Random Heroic Person (Most likely Darion). Why do people think this? Because at LHC after death knight starting area battle, Alexandros appeared and talked to his son's spirit, then the Lich King showed up and sent the Ashbringer's soul back to wherever he keeps his valuables. Alexandros's spirit still isn't free. Least that's the impression I got, and would explain why he has his own forge in the heart of Icecrown.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I would expect and welcome any combination of the above.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samin</div><div class="date">2009-10-07, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, it's sad to realize how few people have done the quest lines in icecrown (and I predict they left out any other they don't need to level up for raiding).<br />
I wonder how many of them are also those people who complain that WotLK lacks lore and Blizzard is destroying Warcraft by doing stupid things with the world (&quot;Why is Dalaran in northrend? OMG BLIZZARD NOOBZ!! LOREFAIL&quot;).<br />
Better ask for Wrathgate achievement for ICC pugs to avoid &quot;blizz is so stupid!!!! y do we fite bolvar? hes ally rit?&quot;<br />
<br />
I hate it when people expect games to shove lore right into their face.<br />
<br />
Sad thing I'm probably never going to see ICC myself...hope there will be a nice overview (aka spoiler) somewhere after launch..maybe even a complete clear video with all events and so on or something like that. (Would actually love this for Ulduar already)<br />

<br />
<br />
So since the Lich King is the enemy of the Alliance, which is our enemy (horde), then the Lich King is our (horde) friend?</div></div><hr />

Where are both co-leaders of cult of the damned http://www.wowwiki.com/Pai_Stormbringer http://www.wowwiki.com/Ul%27haik_Hadanot , hell, where is KT himself? We didn't find his phylatecary yet. Mal'ganis will be probably an addition in LK fight, wished he was a boss encounter. And I thought that Muradin would appear in LK encounter Maiev-style, well, maybe this is for the best.</div></div><hr />

As I read down the text my reaction shifts from &quot;This is gonna be sweet&quot; to &quot;WTF is the point of that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashen Verdict needs to keep our 12 year old leaders in check, because apparently they can't share the playground &gt;&lt;<br />

Well ofcourse Lich King in normal mode most likely will be a pushover so free loot lol. Whoever gets to the loot first win! Epic battle right there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Or, and while being pure speculation;<br />
<br />
Normal mode 10/25:<br />
<br />
LK is beaten off but manages to get away to fight another day.<br />
<br />
HM 10/25:<br />
<br />
LK dies.<br />
<br />
Would solve LK being a pushover and still gives everyone an equal shot of defeating him, just in a different way,</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
hmm no sry but blizz is killing the WC3 story ._. so Arthas never Killed him BUT why should Mal´ganis fight for the Lich King?? he should KILL him coz he helped to kill Archimonde (look @ Illidan in WC3 Arthas tell him how to kill the imba Tichondrius the 1st commander after Archimonde himself! :D). and the Lich King broke the Pact with Kil´Jaeden the 2nd Lord of the Burning Legion :( if Mal´Ganis really fight for the Lich King hes a stupid nerd who can even do something alone !1 :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Icecrown Citadel features 10- and 25-player versions of the raid dungeon, and each version has 12 encounters. Each encounter can be fought in either normal or Heroic mode, and players can use a new user interface feature to toggle easily between difficulties. <br />
<br />
Is it just me that finds the wording of that a little odd - they're talking about toggling the difficulty of the &quot;encounters&quot; rather than &quot;instances&quot;... Does this perhaps mean that we're only having a 10 and a 25 man version of the actual instance (i.e. only 2 saves per week), and we can choose the difficulty of each encounter as we go along? Something more akin to the Ulduar model, but with UI-based hardmode initiation as opposed to mechanic-based.<br />
<br />
Just a thought, it does seem a little... Odd...<br />
<br />
edit: Ah, someone else did pick up on it, I'm just surprised it's not the main topic of conversation this far through the thread... Hey ho...</div></div><hr />

whats worng?? its like Ulduar hardmodes ... ToC was an epic fail 4 time the same Raid in 1 Week ... so we can choose now in ICC the 25 Normal mode or the 25 Heroic(Hardmode) like Ulduar Hardmodes :D i think its better so we cant get 60~ Frost Badgets in a week</div></div><hr />

Raid gets Arthas down to 1% he starts casting &quot;Lich Kings Fury&quot; or that oblivion shit he did to Tirion,mid cast Jaina comes down and trys to talk some sense into him before he kills your raid 1 shot style,then Malganis swoops down murders her and the Lich releases his hold on the raid and blindly goes after mal'ganis in his rage.After a long and tired search,Jainas death hits Arthas so he ports down to his beach side shack in Tanaris and eats ice cream and watches &quot;Ghost&quot; for the next 10 years.<br />

Warcraft 4 has been a rumor how long. You can't have a fourth war with Thrall and Jaina always keeping the peace. All of this is just more and more plot building and I agree that at least one of the heroes (Sylvannas and Proudmore) will not be coming out alive. This to me just look like some much larger plot leading into something much farther down the line.</div></div><hr />
