<br />
Sylvanas<br />
Xal'atath (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Xal%27atath,_Blade_of_the_Black_Empire), a fascinating weapon. I have heard tales of its exploits.<br />
A pit it now lies dormant. But anything that slumbers can be awakened. <br />
This blade is more than a mere dagger, it is a torch that shall light our path forward.<br />
Soon I will call upon you again champion, and together we will steer the Horde towards its destiny. <br />
<br />
War is a living thing. It writhes, it grows, twisting and turning until its final form is revealed.<br />
This war is about to shift yet again, and it will be this blade that guides our way forward.<br />
<br />
Andiun<br />
When Sylvanas Windrunner became Warchief, I knew we would not be friends...but I didn't want us to be enemies. <br />
Then came the massacre in Arathi and the burning of Teldrassil. <br />
It's clear she does not fight for Azeroth, she doesn't even fight for the Horde. She wages war upon life itself.<br />
We are so close to ending this conflict and forging a lasting peace, but if Sylvanas uncovers some new weapon that allows her to keep fighting...<br />
No, we must discover what she's after and stop whatever madness she seeks to unleash upon us. <br />
<br />
Another Old God awakened. This does not bode well. <br />
Our world suffers much as it is. The Wound in Silithus, the war.<br />
The Alliance stands on the brink of victory, of ending this conflict and bringing peace to Azeroth.<br />
Sylvanas sent her champions into that shrine for a reason, she must have discovered something that can shift the war back in her favor. <br />
Whatever that might be, she must not succeed. Be ready for me to call on you again champion, we will stop Sylvanas...once and for all.<br />
<br />
MOTHER<br />
Presence of Speaker indicates imminent threat to Azeroth. <br />
Error. Uldir facility designed for Old God experimentation and containment. Planetary rehabilitation not within operational parameters. <br />
Recommendation: Relocate MOTHER unit to Chamber of Heart facility.<br />
Waygate activation advised. Destination coordinates encoded within Heart of Azeroth.<br />
Welcome back champion, facility contamination levels minimal since successful purge of specimen G'huun.<br />
Extermination of all contaminated specimens recommended. <br />
<br />
Brother Pike<br />
All my life, I've witnessed the duality of the sea. It is both a source of life...and a force of destruction. <br />
I became a tidesage to wield the might of the depths for the good of Kul Tiras. To learn of the great darkness lurking beneath us all this time...<br />
The Old God wants us fractured, divided. I fear this war has given N'Zoth (https://wow.gamepedia.com/N%27Zoth) exactly what he wants.<br />
<br />
Xal'atath<br />
Hear me God of the Deep, I have brought you the Opener. The bringer of Truths. The Torch that lights the way.<br />
Honor our bargain, free me to find my own fate. <br />
A fair exchange, shadows guide you my old friend.<br />
We will meet again, I am certain of it.<br />
<br />
N'Zoth<br />
Go, but the blade must remain to serve my will.<br />
I have dreamed your destiny mortal.<br />
The hour is close at hand.<br />
That which was sunken shall rise.<br />
All that were sleeping shall be awakened.<br />
Receive my gift and see all truths before you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It’s fully known they post datamined stuff on the front page, including broadcast text. It’s easy to spot what it is as well, so nobody forced you to come here and nobody forced you to read it either.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mrbleedinggums</div><div class="date">2019-01-24, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess flagging spoilers has become too difficult?<br />
<br />
I guess basic deductive skills that would see a post about a future patch's VOs (Voiceovers) would indicate that, like every other post about VOs would have a text recap of everything the NPCs would say. That alone should detain anyone that actually cares about spoilers from not reading it. But then again, we're a world that has to have warning labels on bags of peanuts that it contains.... peanuts.<br />
<br />
<br />
the Zandalari are not horde yet and Rastakhan is not a king of the horde - even without meta knowledge.<br />
<br />
That is true, but it is fair to deduce that at the very least, the Horde are staging their operations with the aid of the Zandalari and their fleet. Plus, the Zandalari destroyed the Alliance fleets chasing the ship at the start of the Horde cinematic. It's reasonable to assume from that incident the Zandalari armada is a force to be reckoned with, similar to the Kul Tirans. <br />
<br />
By dealing a crippling blow to their naval capabilities and killing the king, Anduin and his Alliance sought to do exactly what Sylvanas and her Horde did during the march on Teldrassil. Sylvanas decimated the Night Elves in Ashenvale and crippled their control in Darkshore. However, the Night Elves caught wind of what was happening after falling for a ruse (like the Horde in Nazimir) and sailed back immediately to defend their home. Sylvanas, seeing that capturing Teldrassil and holding the area as leverage against any attacks was no longer an option without heavy casualties decided instead to destroy the World Tree hoping to cause dissonance amongst the Alliance. <br />
<br />
The Alliance paralled it by attacking the Zandalari and making a strike to hopefully cause dissonance amongst the Horde. Maybe the trolls would blame the Horde for the death of their king and refuse to help them anymore. Maybe they still become allies but they would need time to rebuild their ability to sail to Kul Tiras for a counter attack. Time that would be very valuable for Anduin to utilize the weapons they stole back from the vaults.</div></div><hr />

If Blizzard puts a plate of shit in front of you and you eat it and think it's delicious. Then perhaps you might be incapable of seeing past your bias and will defend the company regardless of how low they sink. Either that or you have a scat-fetish.</div></div><hr />

No, what really matters is to be moral to a resurrected corpse that lay in the ocean for 30 years instead of using it to strike back at the enemy that just inflicted a blow to the Horde. <br />
Sure, go and give the resurrected corpse back to the enemy even though they'd likely kill it on sight were it any other people. <br />
Why even bothering fighting a war that will decide the fate of the Horde? Just turn on the Warchief who ordered it to start just like before, at least it'll end quickly; <br />
I'm mean it's not like the Alliance will seek to punish the rest of the Horde for being a co-belligerent in Sylvannas' actions. <br />

since day one nearly every aspect of BfA remembers to MoP. Heck, even the music in Boralus has some same touch. Its not that obvious. Its all that small fine things between the lines. And also the story hooks.<br />
<br />
But are they that out of ideas that they just platantly copying an older good worked xpac ???<br />
<br />
I dont get what or where blizz wanna go with all that shit stuff. wether i believe their cost effective development will work, nor their easy to balance classes that are pruned to hell and all work via builder/consumer pattern, nor their D3 gaming style, nor their theme park, nor their activision cash cow systems lead them to success and long term profit. in the end they loose and loose and loose players until their new target audience, the „2-4 months playing and quit forever“ crowd, will also no longer start playing because they hear that „game is dead“. i dont get it...</div></div><hr />

It is just too obvious now with Anduin's words and judgement of the situation. Sylvanas knows something none of us do and is likely trying to stave something off or prevent something far worse than Teldrassil or Arathi. They are really beating this &quot;Sylvanas is Garrosh&quot; drum a bit too hard...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Come on man, for all intents and purposes, Rastakhan would be one of the biggest enemy targets for the Alliance right now, and stomping all over his city would be the number 1 target for the Alliance. Just because you can't make a Zanda troll yet, they've done more for the Horde war effort than half of the races in the Horde.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On top of that, I like the horde as bad guys and want that to stay. Not a single other member of the horde is worthy of it. Even Voljin was nothing but terrible. <br />
<br />
I want more wc2 horde and less hippy horde<br />
<br />
What you personally want is irrelevant and it's up to the writers to decide which direction they want to take. Besides, Sylvanas fans/Evil horde wannabees are in the minority and these threats of quitting are getting old. Don't like it? don't play, simple as that rather than announcing it every moment when everyone knows you guys will still keep playing :rolleyes:.</div></div><hr />

Oh yea that’s why BFa is doing soooooooo well. Right? Climb out of your own butthole and realize that my opinion is as valid as anyone’s. More so than yours. Anyone named dr assbandit has nothing of value to contribute. <br />
<br />
I’ve never threatened to quit. I even stick with the worst of bfa and I’m 10x the player you will ever be.... but sylvanas going bad and jaina getting away is as bad of writing as possible. Children can do better</div></div><hr />

You can still just hide it behind a link, look how wowhead does it. Mmo-c done it before so dunno why they slack on it this time.</div></div><hr />

Capital of their allies, pushing them even more towards Horde, losing an actual Alliance faction leader in the process. Brink indeeed.</div></div><hr />

Lol what does my username have to do with opinions and their value? It's not my fault you don't have a sense of humor ;). And yes I'm sure someone who sounds and acts like a prepubescent teen throwing a temper tantrum is somehow an indicator of their superiority or skill ingame :rolleyes:. Talk about cringy replies.<br />
<br />
Also you literally did threaten to quit:<br />
<br />
<br />
I’ll quit the game if sylvanus turns raid boss.<br />
<br />
Post banshee Sylvanas has never been good. Funny how you guys never complain when the lore favours your favourite faction but start crying the moment the lore favours the Alliance :rolleyes:.</div></div><hr />

and thats a bad thing why? That reminds me of every time a customer doesn't get their way in a retail store (like the one I worked in last) where because they didn't get a proper refund or the line was to long for them, they complained 'I'm never coming here again!', like as if thats meant to be a bad thing for the store, when in reality its the best thing, because less cancerous people to drag down moral.<br />
<br />
And thats what your slice of warcraft fandom is. Only liking crap elements until said crap elements get fixed and then you act like your owed something.<br />

its not even that, when the rest of the horde hate their own leader, then its only about sylvanas being a c**t.</div></div><hr />

What did you do with Flowey? T_T<br />
<br />
As for Sylvanas she isn't even interestingly evil, she's straight up nonsensical. For a leader who is supposed to be lauded for her tactics and manipulation the writers have lately written her as being outright stupid and making decisions that wouldn't make sense if written from her own character development so far. <br />
<br />
And that's the problem with the current writing in WoW. When you have characters being written based off of the whims of the writer and not as what they think the character would do based off the characteristics that were assigned to them then it pulls players out of the fantasy and it ends up looking foolish.<br />
<br />
There just doesn't seem to be any consistency to the lore anymore and that's really unfortunate.</div></div><hr />

Floweys taking a break with frisk.<br />
<br />
And yeah. I've said it before, wow is suffering from the same issues comic books have. The characters you see might look and even sound the same, but the writing for them is not from the same people from 5, 10, 15 years ago. I've seen how guys can turn someone like batman from a rationally thinking character with a sense of humanity in him, to an outright lunatic almost as bad as the criminals he locks up.<br />
<br />
And that's what's happening with wows writing now. We might be the same fans, and we might be looking at the same characters we've been fans of for maybe two decades, but they aren't written by the same people anymore. And the new ones don't honor the old writing team, rather wanting to put their own spin on it.</div></div><hr />
