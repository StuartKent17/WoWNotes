Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Celestalon usually looks down on people who whine about clunky or broken when people talk game mechanics, what do you think when someone approaches you that way<br />
“Clunky” is one of those words that has just lost a lot of meaning over time. I feel like we all used to use “clunky” to mean a lack of elegance, as if little thought or polish was given to the design. Rather than painstakingly crafting a gourmet meal, the designer just threw a bunch of stuff in the stew pot and didn’t give it much additional thought. Or to switch metaphors, I always imagine a car trying to roll on square wheels. It will get you where you’re going, but inefficiently and with a lot of discomfort, and the alternatives is both obvious and a massive improvement. <br />
<br />
To me the things that are most clunky are a general lack of responsiveness (you click, but nothing happens for a bit), or a UI that requires excessive clicking (especially targeting), or bad timing to the flow of something, such as cooldowns all coming up at once, or alternatively long breaks in the cooldown.<br />
<br />
The problem with “clunky” and “broken” is that over time they have lost enough meaning that a lot of players just use them now as a generic “I don’t like this.” Low power or dps can be described as clunky, which is pretty different from the original intent (unless it’s something like the rotation requires a lot of weird hoops to jump through to be competitive, in which case the clunkiness and effectiveness may truly be linked).<br />
<br />
From a developer perspective, we don’t get much specific, actionable feedback when something is described just as clunky or broken. We don’t know what the specific concerns or complaints are, so we feel like we’re just guessing about how to potentially fix it.<br />
<br />
Stepping back a bit, yes, developers should have good intuition about these things and be able to detect problems before they even ship. I also realize that it can be frustrating when you know you don’t like something but can’t quite articulate in game terms what it is. Writing can be hard. Just be patient with us when we can’t read your mind in these situations.<br />
<br />
Yes, given enough time and back-and-forth, I can often tease out more useful feedback. I can ask “What do you mean by the term clunky?” I can offer some kind of multiple choice to help the player really zero in on what their feedback really is. But that kind of conversation takes a ton of bandwidth, and when the situation is typically one of us having a conversation with forty, or a hundred, or a thousand of you at once, it’s sort of hard to justify.<br />
<br />
I think “look down on” is overly harsh. I’d describe it more as mild frustration ranging to disappointment on our end, especially if the player is also angry and impatient in the same breath in which they are being really vague.<br />
<br />
My advice is if you want to be as helpful as possible with your feedback, avoid generic adjectives and intensifiers. Explain as plainly and succinctly as you can what the problem is. Avoid ascribing intention to the developers. Avoid how the change makes you feel, unless emotional resonance is really the issue in question (such as in a story). Don’t make us sift through a haystack of words to find the needle of insight.

Your definition is so vague that you just proved GC's point.<br />
<br />
If a fireball would have a 1 sec. cast, and you had to weave in Fire Blast mid-cast... that would be clunky. Needing to manually dismount before picking a herb, that would be clunky. Be specific.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Few days ago he said player should avoid explaining devs in details what's wrong with a class design because developers don't have time to read all that. Now, he is saying &quot;we don’t get much specific, actionable feedback&quot;. Like what the actual f***?! <br />
<br />
Should players draw info-graphics or make 1 minute long animated videos for devs? Is that the only way for them to understand what the problem is while not taking too much of their precious time they use to decide what to nerf next?<br />
<br />
No, I don't see what you're trying to say. So a few days ago GC said developers don't have time to read verbose feedback, fair enough. Then today he said developers don't get much concise feedback; feedback they get tends to be too verbose. In other words he's reinforcing what he said a few days ago: Feedback tends to be too wordy, and developers don't get enough concise feedback.<br />
<br />
Feedback doesn't have to be verbose to be useful. It just has to be to the point; no BS. The part where GC said 'actionable' feedback basically means feedback that isn't simply &quot;I don't like this, fix it&quot; without any justification as to why it needs fixing.<br />

<br />
People are confusing minimalism with clunkiness. The stock UI is minimalist. Do not confuse lack of data and visual information (no boss mods etc) with clunky; they're not the same thing. Yeah don't get me wrong, the health bars and stuff, all the info, is in a bad location. This isn't clunky, it's just inefficient. Different things entirely. <br />

<br />
Ghostcrawler has never understood what clunky means when it comes to feedback apparently. It means the design of the interaction isn't intuitive in nature. It takes more thought to achieve a goal than it should.<br />
<br />
We have a word to describe that. It's called 'unintuitive'. GC's point is proven; people use the word 'clunky' to suit their own needs these days. You just used it to describe a roundabout process to achieve a goal. Since the official definition of 'clunky' has nothing to do with the context gamers seem to love using it in, let's just say it's a loose term with a ton of different interpretations. If it takes me 3 clicks to do what could be done in 1, I don't call that clunky. Unnecessarily complicated or convoluted, perhaps, but clunky? No. Clunky, to my mind, would be if half the clicks didn't even register for some reason. But as I already said it's a word with a ton of interpretations, any hundred people could quote this very post and say 'no, that's NOT what clunky means'. Everyone's gonna have to agree to disagree. But if you want to be pedantic about it, go look it up in the dictionary. It refers to something that can be physically clumpy, old fashioned or describe a clunking sound. Gamers practically took the word and coined their own adaptable definition from it.<br />

If a fireball would have a 1 sec. cast, and you had to weave in Fire Blast mid-cast... that would be clunky. Needing to manually dismount before picking a herb, that would be clunky. Be specific.<br />
<br />
What are you even talking about? If you have to weave a fire blast mid cast, that's not clunky. It's rotation. YOU proved GC's point; you personally find the idea of weaving Fire Blasts mid cast to be unappealing, so you personally define it as being 'clunky'. I personally think it's a non-issue and would make the rotation more enjoyable and (re)active. You can't just redefine words to suit your argument and then claim others don't understand what the word means. If the time you have to weave in said FB is quite short, it would make it difficult. Difficulty =/= clunky<br />
<br />
Manually needing to dismount to pick up a herb would be inconvenient, but when you think about it whenever people lose conveniences they've known for years, they call it clunky. Play WoW for years without auto-dismount and you don't complain at all. Enjoy auto dismount for a week or two. If the feature gets taken away again, people would start screaming about it being clunky, despite the fact they had it that way for years without complaint. <br />
<br />
Example: Nobody calls it clunky that you have to re-mount AFTER picking a herb or mining an ore node, but I guarantee if they made it so interacting with herbs or ores didn't dismount you in the first place, then took that feature away again, people would bitch en-masse on the forums about how you have to 'mount after picking a herb' and how it's 'clunky and badly designed gameplay'<br />
<br />
How about next time I play an adventure game I complain about the game being clunky because I have to press B to grab an object when it should just pick up automatically! or call it clunky because the character controls in a very slippery or perhaps sluggish manner? I can't just use the word to suit my own needs and expect it to be an accurate definition!<br />
<br />
I can say for certain almost nobody I know is onto this craze of over-using the word clunky, but whenever I browse gaming sites or forums the term is totally overused like crazy. I assume it must be an American thing or something.</div></div><hr />

This bastardization of the term needs to stop! It is not meant for when something is broken, unintuitive, or flawed. It is a word to be used specifically in gaming when you get something that is functional yet lacks the polish and details that we would expect in a modern choice of design. The addon in the post above is a perfect example of fighting &quot;clunky&quot;. The default Icon picker opens a small, insanely long window for us to comb through carefully. When it was created many years ago, it was an innovative design with a much smaller amount of icons to pick from, so it was perfectly acceptable. However, times change, and the amount of icons has grown a lot. The function has become &quot;clunkly&quot; in nature - we can use it as its intended (find an icon), but we all know its a dated design. BetterIconSelect is everything it needs to not be clunky, and frankly, the developers should strongly consider implementing this kind of addon as a default in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I gave a good example.<br />
A 1-second Fireball with Fire Blast weaving would be unnecessarily clunky.<br />
The current (base) 2.25-second-cast fireball w/ Fire Blast weaving is not clunky at all.<br />
There are obvious reasons for this, apart from &quot;personal definitions of clunkiness&quot;, for example latency issues, to name one, as WoW is designed to be played on a variety of computers and internet connection types.<br />
<br />

He talks more about a game he doesn't even work for than the people getting paid to do it. His response was very good and it isn't contradictory to his last one. Don't give them a thesis on what is bad. Treat it like a memo. This this and this are bad and this is why. <br />
<br />
For example, the 10% nerf to hood of eternal disdain is bad. It further unaligns the cool downs on Affliction dots which means you have to swap back and forth between targets refreshing dots at different intervals instead of being able to click through and refresh them all one after another, while having it be optimal play. It is obnoxious for no other reason that to be so. If a nerf is warranted, it would be better for the flow of the spec if the nerf came in the way of a small number reduction than by changing the dot durations.</div></div><hr />

Giving its definition is only helpful up to a point, because people experience things differently. You can become accustomed to something quite quickly and it ceases to feel clunky - or you can simply not have the required sensitivity to perceive said clunkiness. Sometimes it is only revealed when fixed and can only be seen or felt in hindsight, and sometimes it's just a matter of opinion like in the way some people prefer manual transmission in cars to automatic.<br />

1.) I was no fan of Ghostcrawler either, but neither you nor I speak for everyone.<br />
<br />
2.) There is only one prominent person that I can think of that was fired by Blizzard, that being Tseric (wow.gamepedia.com/Tseric) way back in mid-2007. When Ghostcrawler left Blizzard three years ago, it was on good terms.<br />
<br />
3.) While I disagree with a lot of design decisions that were influenced by Ghostcrawler even to this day (still sore over his &quot;buff bitches&quot; comment), I still read the posts because I find them to be an interesting perspective even though I may not necessarily agree.</div></div><hr />

An example of bad communication on the communities' end, the Warlocks. It's well known that the Warlock specs aren't that fun to play compared to other classes, but the term they use to describe this is &quot;clunky&quot;. Demonic Empowerment is &quot;clunky&quot;. Soul Shards on Destruction are &quot;clunky&quot;. Soul Effigy is &quot;clunky&quot;. Yes, it means the specs aren't fun/intuitive. But let's take a look from a developer's perspective.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey &lt;game designer&gt;, the Warlocks are saying Affliction's Soul Effigy is clunky.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, what do we do about it to fix the clunkiness? Anything specific?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh. Well we can't fix anything without making a guess at what's really wrong with the spec. Keep looking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even if they play the spec, it still won't give them the information needed to please the community. What the developers consider fun and intuitive might be different from the playerbase. You can't just expect the developers to know what the players are complaining about. That's why there's a difference between good and bad feedback<br />
<br />
I agree on Affliction, but I've played Demonology and I don't understand why Demonic Empowerment is &quot;clunky&quot; to the Demos on the forums. It feels fine to me. Even if we were to fix it, how? Would we remove the spell entirely? That would make Demonology feel a bit simple to me.<br />
<br />
If anything, Thalkiel's Consumption is &quot;clunky&quot; to me because there's no way to track how many demons you have out without an addon, and the fact that there's no specific number of demons you need to cast it at, you need to make an educated guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Clunky&quot; is/was a well-established term that was easily identifiable in games. But somehow, because he's out of touch when it comes to game &quot;clunk&quot; he should dismiss it. The man worked on a top-down strategy game so he doesn't understand how much &quot;clunk&quot; ruins actual 3D games, especially ones with action and platforming mechanics.<br />
<br />
<br />
The irony is you don't know what clunky means.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fudal</div><div class="date">2016-12-21, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest issue that I have seen isn't the bad communication of issues ( yes, there is a lot of very poor description on the player's end). It is the total lack of understanding of how the specs even function from the developers. <br />
<br />
Secondary stats are an easy example; the same developers that are responsible for balancing damage design the stats for your items. Now, look at the pathetic class armor that they gave you. I have yet to see a single set that was itemized properly for even one of the specs. Or, if you set your loot spec to Sub and get a 870 drop that is specced vers/ haste; now you get a shiny new enchanting mat. Thanks devs</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of the time it is just Bads complaining, who cannot manage the new System - not a static rotation, but you have to play re actively and manage a lot of stuff at the same time. No, they want to spam Shadowbolt and nothing else, and be TOP DPS. And not have to mind encounter mechanics as well ;). &quot;It is just a game, I already have a Job&quot; etc</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zairn</div><div class="date">2016-12-21, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My advice is if you want to be as helpful as possible with your feedback, avoid generic adjectives and intensifiers. Explain as plainly and succinctly as you can what the problem is. Avoid ascribing intention to the developers. Avoid how the change makes you feel, unless emotional resonance is really the issue in question (such as in a story).<br />
<br />
God, yes, this, how hard is this for some people to understand. The quickest way to show you have no fucking clue what you are talking about and are safe to ignore is ascribing intention to devs. If you say &quot;The devs dont understand this game&quot; or &quot;they don't play x obviously&quot; you show everyone how ignorant and petulant a child you are instead of doing something productive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And here is yet another crying warlock. The issue with warlocks is, that the amount of constructive feedback is 0. &quot;OMG blizzard it's clunky!&quot; &quot;but why?&quot; &quot;its CLUNKY FIX IT NAO!&quot;<br />
Repeat while warlocks cry they get ignored.<br />
<br />
Signed, a warlock :D</div></div><hr />

Always hilarious when some community classes pretend like their class is more important than others (typically they belittle hybrids as dps specs) just &quot;because imma pure dps&quot; &quot;because warlocks or mages are gods and a filthy shadow or feral shouldn't beat me in dps blablabla&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Soul effigy is clunky 100%, having to respawn an add to do damage is not compelling in the least, and nor should it be desired.<br />
<br />
Demonology has so many things almost requiring addons to be played in anyway near properly, like Demonic Empowerment shouldn't only effect spawned demons it should be a buff you keep rolling or a big bursty CD not a buff you continuously recast every demon spawn.<br />
<br />
Destruction has no actual soul shard generator because Chaos Bolt hits to hard period, so they make the generation rng based its not good at all.<br />
<br />
Then there is a bunch of issues w/ monks and fel rush leading to game crashes and so on. <br />
<br />
Now I agree &quot;Bloat&quot; shouldn't be considered &quot;Clunk&quot; and neither should imbalance be considered clunk, but in reality there is some serious flaws to gameplay mechanics atm.<br />
<br />
Then we have the keystones, which have led to finding people in 880-890~ gear levels completely not capable of playing the game to even a remotely viable capability. I legit saw a DH w/ 3million HP in Havoc doing under 300k meanwhile Im sitting above 320k in the 865 area. World Quests add to this, but they aren't nearly as bad as the RNG based keystones. Simply if you remove the specification of a dungeon, people won't spam carry for AP they will pick up their friends, guildies, and continue to play. However all the bad kids back to playing WoW again because Legion isn't terrible may quit again.<br />
<br />
In the end, developers need to listen to &quot;this isn't working&quot; not &quot;I dont like what you did&quot; this isn't our game, we don't make it and the fact they take any feedback is cool, but like others have said Idgaf a if any of the Devs don't like a word being used.</div></div><hr />

If you wowhead an ability on the right side it will show you the icon name. Once you learn the syntax you can start guessing or narrowing down the search quiet a bit.</div></div><hr />
