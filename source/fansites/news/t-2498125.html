From Frank Pearce<br />
The time has come for me to step away from Blizzard and pass the torch to the next generation of leaders.<br />
<br />
My journey as part of the Blizzard community began over 28 years ago. Allen offered me an opportunity to join him and Mike in their adventure and dream to make video games. Video games were a passion that we shared, and I had only a fleeting hope that I would have the opportunity to make games one day. The decision was easy for me - I did not have the benefit of internet searches to help start me down the path. Allen’s offer letter was the best and only chance I thought I might ever have. Looking back, I know how incredibly fortunate I was to have been a part of what Blizzard has become.<br />
<br />
Our efforts were always guided by well-intentioned purpose. We made games that we wanted to play, believing that like-minded people would also want to play those games. Today we characterize it more specifically with the ambitious vision of bringing the world together through epic entertainment. I am so proud to have had the chance to positively impact the lives of so many people through the experiences we have created.<br />
<br />
My time at Blizzard encompasses the entirety of both my professional career and my adult life. I have countless fond memories. Working with the best developers in the world on the best franchises in the world definitively stands out. Even more prominent are my memories of our first BlizzCon where I realized the special importance of the people and communities that had become part of the experience for our players.<br />
<br />
Words cannot express the gratitude I feel to have been involved with Blizzard, our games, our employees, and most importantly our community. Before Blizzard I struggled to find a place in which I felt I belonged. Now I know I will always have a place, as will many other people. Thank you to all of you for providing me the sense of inclusion I require as a person.<br />
<br />
I have been lucky enough to work with J and Ray for many years, and now it is their responsibility to define how the adventure continues. They are game development leaders that are incredibly talented, experienced, and truly understand what is foundationally most important for Blizzard and our community. I know that the future of Blizzard will be amazing under their guidance. There are many exciting initiatives in the works, and I can’t wait to see the end results.<br />
<br />
Everything I have done at Blizzard has been driven by my passion. I have worked very hard and very passionately for a very long time. Now it is time for me to reflect and be thoughtful about what comes next. I plan to spend more time active in the outdoors. I’d like to learn to play an instrument. I hope to devote more time to aspects of my life that may not have gotten as much attention in the past. One thing is for certain – I will continue to be a part of the Blizzard family.<br />
<br />
My request and hope for all of you is that you continue living the Blizzard values and that you be kind and respectful to one another as you experience what Blizzard creates in the future. Blizzard is a special place and a special community, and everyone with whom you interact is important to the Blizzard journey as it continues forward. Thanks to everyone for the wonderful past I have enjoyed, and thank you in advance for the great future I expect we will share.<br />
<br />
Play nice, play fair,<br />
Frank<br />
<br />
From J. Allen Brack<br />
The time has come to say goodbye to one of my heroes, one of our founders, as well as one of our friends. When I moved into my new position last year, Frank stepped into an advisory role to help with the transition, specifically working with Ray Gresko and me on our games, culture, and the future of Blizzard. His support has been invaluable to us and to say we’re going to miss him is an understatement.<br />
<br />
The first time I met Frank was during a lunch interview to join Blizzard. I was nervous not only because I was excited about the opportunity to join a company I loved, but because I was sitting face-to-face with one of the founders of Blizzard. <br />
<br />
Frank can be intimidating, and sometimes comes across as a bit gruff. Underneath is a person of deep feeling, and of deep love for both the family of Blizzard, and the unique and caring community that has grown around Blizzard games. Frank is also a person I’m proud to call a close friend. Frank was one of the people who got me into running, and we’ve run dozens of races together over the years.<br />
<br />
Like many of us, Frank is an introvert. Thus many of you haven’t seen a lot of him publicly, nor seen the deep impact he’s had on Blizzard, and on the culture specifically. But Frank has been here from the beginning, building and expanding the foundation and championing the values behind everything Blizzard does. Blizzard is better because of Frank Pearce.<br />
<br />
A few BlizzCons ago, Frank talked about the value of human connection through video games, feeling a sense of belonging within the community, and that comes from a very personal place for Frank. Frank might be hanging up his armor now, but because of the influence he’s had in helping to build Blizzard and the connections he’s made with so many of us, veterans and new recruits alike who are all carrying the same torch forward, he’ll always be here with us.<br />
<br />
We love you Frank.<br />

<br />
I'm really not sure if I'll ever come back to WoW. Not because of this specifically, but just becaues of what the game has been the past few years, with no indication that its changing for the better. With most of the original team that made WoW what it was when it was most popular long gone, the only thing I can think of now is Activision's plans for squeezing every last drop out of wow.</div></div><hr />

How does it matter? Blizzard isnt creating the games they created 30 years ago. Time moves on and that's good.<br />

sounds to me like he was forced out of his position by J Allen or Activision<br />

Never said it was bad :confused:<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay. Honest question. How is Blizzard gonna go back to the good old days of making quality games, when the people of those times leave?<br />
<br />
Those founders members leaving are probably in their 50's to 60's. Don;t think they wanna make games anymore. I think people forget that.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is 30+ years old. They cannot work there forever.</div></div><hr />

They won't. Not like Activision would even let them. Good Old Days didn't have aggressive monetization, &quot;micro&quot;transactions and lootboxes.</div></div><hr />

if money is reason, then he would left since ages<br />
wrath made so much money that it probably made blizz sunk in mountains of real life hard cold cash, why did he stay that long specially after WoD ?<br />
i'm more on boat of what already leaked, exposed and proven, activision is taking full control any kicking anyone who can stop that one by one, i mean activision 'only' holds the record of destroy entire video game industry before, only company to ever do that, and if it wasn't for nintendo video game industry would produce game of super mario bros quality in the 2000s<br />
I always roll my eyes whenever anyone think there is a single video game company worse than activision, what can u do worse than literally destroy video game industry and finish it? seriously check the whole ET fiasco, and how everyone advised Nintendo to not spend any money in video game anymore because that industry is over, killed dead and buried thanks to the limitless greed of activision</div></div><hr />

By hiring new blood that have passion for games. Like every other industry.<br />

I mean, they could not stay there forever, those guys are old, this would happen eventually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. As we're all getting older, we're watching the people that made the games we grew up with start to retire. This is nothing out of the ordinary, and was eventually going to come no matter if Blizzard became part of Activision, or remained independent for it's entire life. Time stops for no man, which means these guys were going to be retiring eventually no matter what.</div></div><hr />

no it isn't<br />
it is common to jump ship and leave company when u can find a better one, and prior to activision fucking blizzard, how many pc gaming companies u can name were better to leave blizzard ? the list for me was zero<br />
I know a friend who changed jobs until he got a strong position in Amazon, now he has zero plan to leave, because that what normal ppl do, they change jobs until they secure better ones, and blizz even now is still one of biggest (wasn't activision ranked biggest gaming company in usa prior to diablo 'don't u have phones' fuck its shares ?) companies, a sane person won't leave it unless he was either forced or know how activision is really fucking it up<br />
well activision probably wish to destroy video game industry again, they only did it once and failed because Nintendo, i wonder if they can do that with now far more stronger companies, Sony alone has billions in gaming and can easily save whatever shit activision try to do</div></div><hr />

I know a friend who changed jobs until he got a strong position in Amazon, now he has zero plan to leave, because that what normal ppl do, they change jobs until they secure better ones, and blizz even now is still one of biggest (wasn't activision ranked biggest gaming company in usa prior to diablo 'don't u have phones' fuck its shares ?) companies, a sane person won't leave it unless he was either forced or know how activision is really fucking it up<br />
well activision probably wish to destroy video game industry again, they only did it once and failed because Nintendo, i wonder if they can do that with now far more stronger companies, Sony alone has billions in gaming and can easily save whatever shit activision try to do<br />
<br />
The sane person sees a 60 year old man in a high stress corporate job retiring because he wants to. I don't know what your rambling is. Reply when your &quot;friend&quot; has worked in one place for 28 years, is in their 50's or 60's(which is the age people retire at in the US), and has more money than they'll ever spend. Anything to force your insane narrative though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Clozer</div><div class="date">2019-07-19, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if money is reason, then he would left since ages<br />
wrath made so much money that it probably made blizz sunk in mountains of real life hard cold cash, why did he stay that long specially after WoD ?<br />
i'm more on boat of what already leaked, exposed and proven, activision is taking full control any kicking anyone who can stop that one by one, i mean activision 'only' holds the record of destroy entire video game industry before, only company to ever do that, and if it wasn't for nintendo video game industry would produce game of super mario bros quality in the 2000s<br />
I always roll my eyes whenever anyone think there is a single video game company worse than activision, what can u do worse than literally destroy video game industry and finish it? seriously check the whole ET fiasco, and how everyone advised Nintendo to not spend any money in video game anymore because that industry is over, killed dead and buried thanks to the limitless greed of activision<br />
<br />
What i read: &quot;i've worked for over 30 years and its time for me to enjoy my life and family again. Learn an instrument and i love you all&quot;<br />

Diablo 2 was awesome. warcraft 3 as well. I really enjoyed WoW for the first few expansions. And even Hearthstone back when it was not all about limited time bundles. And personally I really liked Reaper of Souls. It improved a lot on Diablo 3. And the later patch zones are among the best in terms of atmosphere. Unfortunately all real updates stopped.<br />

Well you know there is a middleground between Witcher 3 and whatever BfA is. (Not gonna compare it to WW2 warcrimes).<br />

Blizzard games haven't been amazing the past 10 years, but they were still fun-ish. Yet they are getting progressively worse. And since the old people are leaving the same time, I can't help but see a correlation between the two events. Don't tell me you do not.</div></div><hr />

Hearthstone is not 10 years old? Besides that Overwatch broke records and was the most sold video game in 2016 and you are telling me that games are becoming worse and worse? You could argue that you for some reason dislike BFA, but man 8.2 is the best patch this game ever had and im playing the warcraft games since tft. Besides that i assume that d4 will be announced soon another game that will break records. So no the games are not getting worse and worse and i dont any see any correlation between this and old guys retiring..</div></div><hr />

Basically, it looks like Blizzard is slowly reforming without Activision. Call me crazy, but I'd not be surprised if more and more folks of the old Blizzard end up with them again.<br />

almost like the &quot;old blizzard&quot; people are in their fucking sixties and have been making games for 30-40 years?<br />

Activision could behead Moreheim in front of Blizzard HQ and they would say &quot;I guess he just wanted his head and body to go seperate ways&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;everyone loses their passion at the same time&quot; you mean over the last like 10 years? the old blizzard team have been retiring/leaving for 10 years now, this is not something suddenly new.<br />

<br />
Blizzard is 30+ years old, obviously there will be a flood of retirements when they all hit 60+, especially when all of them will have more money than they ever need. It has nothing to do with anything else but becoming old and tired. Let them rest, they earned it.<br />
<br />
People seem to forget blizzard is 30 years old, and they went under a different name before that, and had been developing for even longer then that, some of these people have been in the video game indsutry for 35 years. (all the way back on the fucking NES)<br />

So hearthone a game couple years ago that's purely based on an ingame-shop is the last great game created by the great old blizzard and now couple years later everything is shit and so bad and you wish old blizzard back? <br />
<br />
Interesting.<br />
<br />
Which means the &quot;old great blizzard&quot; created Cata, Mop, and Wod. cause hearthstone came out end of mop, meaning wod was already being made.<br />
<br />
<br />
i love this roller coaster of people trying to fit stuff into an agenda. &quot;old blizzard was from vanilla to wrath, but then dissapeared for cata, but came back for mop, except the pandas, and for hearthstone, but then went away for wod, but then came back for legion, except the AP system, and now is gone again!&quot;<br />

<br />
I think Blizzard wow developer truely went downhill at the end of 2015, Wod was showing that there was no content, Starcraft more like deadcraft Diablo III had just released the session system which I can say I liked, Hearthstone was less money grab than it is right now as the cards you got from buying a adventure is completely useless.<br />
<br />
Except now they add constant free adventures that cost either gold or are 100% free, while also giving TONS of free packs away at every chance they get?<br />
hmmm sure sounds like they are so much more money hungry then back when they said &quot;alright here is an adventure, pay a ton for it, oh also buy all our packs too&quot;</div></div><hr />

They literally announced when J. Allaen took over that from now on their focus is release more games and faster instead of experimenting and cancelling projects. Aka quantity over quality<br />
<br />
Have you heard the tail of hots?<br />
<br />
Instead of rushing it out and getting it out before Dota 2 they held it back and experimented. they played with it and made it wonderful, differnt from all other moba's<br />
now look at it.<br />
as they themselves said, if they had rushed it out and just... made dota 2 themselves, they would have won the market.<br />
atleast against whatever valve would have to do instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
also you say &quot;make games faster instead of experimenting&quot;<br />
<br />
can you show me where you like experimenting? cause blizz has been experimenting on wow for a decade, yet every bit of experimenting they seem to do people shit on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i would love if you could explain why you think EXPERIMENTING by nature is good. and why it would breed success?<br />
<br />
also who says quantity over quality is a bad thing?<br />
<br />
if you want to feed a starving nation quanity is better, if you can fill your 100,000 peoples stomaches with food to hold them off, good.<br />
<br />
but feed only 1000 with extravagant food that pampers their soul and spirit, the other 99,000 are going to be coming with pitchforks for your head.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
you use alot of buzz words, without really saying... .why?<br />
<br />
&quot;No more experimenting&quot;<br />
&quot;Quantity over quality&quot;<br />
<br />
is most peoples issues, and i assume yours aswell, with wow BECAUSE OF EXPERIMENTING?<br />
<br />
Blizzard experimented with classes changing them up to see if they could be better. Oh look people are complaining.<br />
blizzard experimented with a mission ta- oh look<br />
blizzard experimented with the store and oh look<br />
blizzard experimented with removing sets<br />
removing gems<br />
removing enchants<br />
<br />
you get the point?<br />
<br />
experimenting for the just right out &quot;EXPERIMENTING IS GOOD!' Is not true at all.<br />
<br />
if blizzard just... stopped experimenting at wotlk, and just... kept adding content, without messing with systems, or classes, or mefchanics do you not think we would.... be in a better place?<br />
<br />
or are you saying everything since wotlk is good &quot;because it was an experiment&quot; and &quot;if its an experiment that means its good&quot;<br />
<br />
experiments are just that, something to test, but experimenting is not perfect, to experiment does not suddenly mean whatever you are doing, or what is made is good.<br />
<br />
stop it.</div></div><hr />

If this is the case then why has EVERYONE that has left blizzard in good and bad terms been on the same page when it comes to Activision being very hands off.

Also, have to quote this, for the truth<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a constant source of amusement that the very same people who are constantly bitching about how Blizzard's management needs to be replaced are all suddenly falling all over themselves at the exit of some senior person--part of that management that needs to be replaced--at how this spells out the doom of the company and all the rats are leaving the sinking ship and any other lazy catch phrase that you can think of.

<br />
To be fair that's more due to management issues than game faults. The instant expansion to half a dozen more servers than they needed much like bless split the population and half the servers were dead after the initial rush. The whole 2 faction system in general wasn't needed. If they cut down on the theme park aspect and focused more on the pve aspects the game could have been very viable. The scope of the game forced a need for immediate subs if it had been cut down a bit would have been fine. Also warfronts in general were a colossal waste of resources that should have been saved for an expansion. The game itself had amazing bones but they tried to instantly compete with everything wow had built over a decade instead of slowly growing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a constant source of amusement to me that some people think there's only two types of people out there; themselves and everyone who has a differing opinion than them on any one particular thing.<br />
<br />
The people saying management need to be replaced aren't the same people saying it's doom and gloom when management leaves. While they may both disagree with you, that doesn't mean they agree with each other.<br />
<br />
You can disagree with Person X about Thing Y, and you disagree with Person Y about Thing X, but that doesn't mean either Person X or Person Y will or will not agree with each other over Thing X or Thing Y.</div></div><hr />

Why? I really don't understand. Where i live in the EU you have to work up until 65-67 to go retire. Probably he was in his early 20s when he started so he just barely hit 50 (or not even 50 yet when he started at 20 which was common back then). And people call him old?

I would agree. I've worked at multiple locations, and see people come and go all the time, at all levels. In the span he worked at Blizzard, the average person has changed jobs 12 times. So the more surprising thing in today's job market is that he stayed there for 28 years.<br />
<br />
I also don't think most folks have a clue how stressful it is running the business is at the level he is at, and how many hours you work. I suspect he's set for money, and is doing what a lot of folks would like to do which is the retire while they are young enough to really enjoy it.<br />

I would say it's more about the time he's been working at one place that's the outlier. He's not old by any means, but it's rare these days, at least in the U.S., to see someone work at the same company for 30 years.</div></div><hr />

You don't have to work to 65-67. You can retire whenever you want. You just have to have money to do it.<br />

You also have to realise how much money these people will have made over that time being one of the founders of such a massive company. They’re able to retire early because they’ll have millions in the bank that allow them to do so.</div></div><hr />

You may not believe this but there's a regular community here that posts a lot and which I have cause to see. It's not a huge community. After a number of years you tend to know who they are and what their standard positions are on the game, Blizzard, etc. I'm not in the business of naming names but trust me when I tell you that in this case some of them are very much the same people.<br />
<br />
28 years at one place is a very long time. As a company founder I'm sure he has enough money--&quot;fuck you money&quot; it's sometimes called--to live well the rest of his life. If he wants to retire or even go do something else it's his right and I wish him well.</div></div><hr />

again idk if you know anything about game development, they cancel DOZENS if not HUNDREDS of games, the starcraft game was just one of those ones we learned about, alot of them stay internal, specifically to stop people like you from doomsaying because of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So your counter arguments that the fresh people can create games just as good as the old team are:<br />
<br />
Diablo 4 which hasn't even been announced yet so we have zero idea regarding its quality<br />
Warcraft reforged which is basically one of their old games but with better graphics<br />
Diablo Immortal which caused an uproar at last BlizzCon, has not been released yet, and is not even made by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
I respect you are a diehard Blizzard fan, but at least try to come up with proper arguments. Since you also happen to look down and me for some unfathomable reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hahahaha throwaway 1337 so imaginative.<br />
<br />
Dude I make YouTube videos for a living. &quot;Die of cancer and do this place a favor&quot; isn't even good enough to be framed and put on my wall...<br />
<br />
If you're gunna tell me to die of cancer, dont be a pussy and hide behind a burner account. It makes you look cowardly, sad, pathetic, and weak to hide behind a nothingness knowing you will have zero reprucssions cause you made a throw away account. Do it on your main account like a man and take your temp ban like a man. I dont make temp accounts to call people like you pricks to avoid bans. I do it here and get banned then wait it out.<br />
<br />
Hell I might get banned for this, but speaking your a burner account that told me to die of cancer. I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People like you are the reason why WoW is in a fucking dire state. Acting like Blizzard can do no wrong while you ride their dick going around a forum to prove people wrong with your shitty walls of text.<br />
<br />
What you think you are clever because you do it? You are nothing more than an attention seeking fucking autist who was never loved enough in the real world so needs a virtual one for validation.<br />
<br />
Lol... Blizzard does many things wrong. The only one here saying anything like &quot;they are perfect&quot; is you just then. <br />
Blizzard does millions of things wrong. I made a tweet telling blizz to get their shit together after lying to us through their teeth about how to obtain essences. <br />
And I have critizied em on hundreds if not thousands of things.<br />
But I dont come to these forums crying ever single day, cause it is already filled with that. So I counter some of the dumb stupid bullshit people make up here. Like &quot;guy retires after 28 years, proof company is dying&quot; so Is nintendo dying? Reggie is still young but he retired...<br />
<br />
And people like you. I feel like you think your messege here is making me sad, making me feel bad, or making me angry. Nah man I love your comment and lots like em. Cause they make me feel good that I'm making that people who rather make up random bullshit angry. And that people who will play along with stupid conspiracy theories. People who will shit on wow an almost 15 year long mmo. While praising wildstar, a game that didnt even hit its 5 year anniversary. But is the best game ever made by the best people ever...<br />
<br />
<br />
I love it, be mad all you want. Never have I said the game or blizzard are perfect. I am mad with them and with the game constantly. <br />
<br />
But I dont come to these forums crying in 80 different threads a day because there is hundreds of people who already do that. Many of them over made up shit, that I rather correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Awwww but keep thinking you are still special because you have a 100 subscriber Youtube channel. I mean you are special but not in that way. The kind where you need a helper just to basically function in everyday society.<br />
<br />
If you died tomorrow. Nobody in the world would miss you. And your few friends who ride Blizzards dick with you on this site wouldn't notice either. It would be a blessing.<br />

On topic. Another rat fleeing the ship I see. Can't blame him for leaving Activision. Fucking joke of a company to work for.<br />
<br />
100? You mean 192k and 75k? <br />
Hey my video that came out week ago is at 230k views. Not bad. No where near as good as my 500k view vid though. Making sweet money working pretty low time, what are you doing for a living?<br />
<br />
Man you are a spiteful little brat. Stop flattering yourself though, only people actually good at toasts get on my wall of hate. Your hatred here seems more like a toddler with a temper tantrum. Now dark Pluto that one was fucking great. Let me see if I can find it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OH SHIT. You made a tweet about essences? Did you get your special needs helper to help you tweet it on something that isn't a huge focus?<br />
<br />
And please I've seen your &quot;critique&quot; on Reddit and here. You fucking go for the most pointless critique that nobody is actually giving two fucks about to try and claim you critique them. You are a fucking fraud at most.<br />
<br />
Please just do the world a favour and die of cancer. Nobody on this forum actually likes you. Most people who friended you are either other Activision dicksuckers or did out of pity for your Autism.<br />
<br />
Nobody cares about your long winded posts nor did they ask for them or for you to go quote 5 different people to tell them why they are wrong even though your long winded shit doesn't actually do that. So do the forum a favour. Kindly shut the fuck up, fuck off and don't come back.<br />
<br />
Better yet stay off the internet all together. Maybe go seek validation in the real world for a change.<br />
<br />
Odd you make fun of me for long winded posts but here you are... Making longer posts then me!<br />
Also my critique on reddit? I dont think I ever posted my crituqes of the game on reddit... <br />
<br />
But man you need to work on your hate game. You are acting like a cringy Xbox twelve year old.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one likes you&quot;<br />
&quot;No one will kiss you&quot;<br />
&quot;Die of cancer&quot;<br />
&quot;Your autistic&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
It almost reminds me of those bullies in middle school who had real horrible lives at home so at school they just tried to put everyone down. Dude maybe you should just leave these forums if they are making you so angry? I dont suck Activision's dick I agree with them when they are right, disagree with them when they are wrong, and disagree with them when they nerf warlocks cause fuck u blizz give us back metamorphic and green fire.</div></div><hr />

By all means flaunt your pathetic Youtube shit here. Will only prove my point about how you need attention here because nobody but your carer gives it to you in the real world because they'd rather hang themselves than spend a second with you.<br />
<br />
Hell only reason your carer gives you attention is because they have to stop you licking windows or probably drinking bleach. Shame about the bleach one tbh.<br />

Commented with another account? What do you mean commented with another account? Its the same account. Idk if you know but you can change your channel name. The channel was originally greenyoshi100 so that is the URL but if you change your name. Like I did to felplague. The URL still says Greenyoshi100 cause that is your account ID...<br />
<br />
You can click the comment you say is on &quot;another account&quot; and it brings you to my channel man... You are seriously making up shit, its sad.<br />

Idk if you noticed, but this entire time you have been proving exactly why I'm herez to make fun of and prove people like you wrong.<br />
<br />
1. In the comment you can click the link and it goes to my channel the one you said is my &quot;shit 100 sub channel&quot;<br />
<br />
2. At the end of the video it shows the editor, me who did research, concept ,writing, script writing, as, editing. Then you can click the channel and again... It brings you to my channel...<br />

“Two old (and now rich) men retired after working at company for almost 30 years say they want to spend more time with family, more at 11”<br />
<br />
Why are you trying to turn this into a conspiracy theory?<br />
<br />
The fact two founders cashed out in a short space of time is not a conspiracy theory. If the going was good they would have stayed. But they're in a position to know when it's time to get out, and they chose to get out now.<br />

Is it dumb? How is it dumb, but 2 people who have been working for the exact same company for just under half their life, retiring at... Retiring age. Somehow being a conspiracy, not dumb? <br />
<br />
People have been retiring from blizzard for a decade, and every single time they do people go up in arms saying &quot;sinking ship sinking ship they are being replaced by Activision&quot; <br />
<br />
No, these people have been working the same job for almost 3 decades, of course they want change.<br />
<br />
Also I guess Nintendo is going under, cause why else would Reggie step down for bowser?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instead of rushing it out and getting it out before Dota 2 they held it back and experimented. they played with it and made it wonderful, differnt from all other moba's<br />
now look at it.<br />
as they themselves said, if they had rushed it out and just... made dota 2 themselves, they would have won the market.<br />
atleast against whatever valve would have to do instead.<br />
<br />
Bullshit. They didn't give a F. about MOBAs until they saw how much money it makes. Release before Dota2?!?!?! Dota was RELEASED in 2013. HotS was started as a passion project by Samwise Didier in 2012, after creating a playable demo in his/their spare time Blizzard allowed the development in 2013 and it was released in 2015. It was literally rushed out to cach the end of the MOBA hysteria ... Yeah, let me quote you: &quot;now look at it&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
also you say &quot;make games faster instead of experimenting&quot;<br />
<br />
can you show me where you like experimenting? cause blizz has been experimenting on wow for a decade, yet every bit of experimenting they seem to do people shit on.<br />
Literally what?! We talk about developing new games. New genres... not a F.ing WoW patch... I like experimenting there... You know, like the Titan project which led to Overwatch.<br />
<br />
<br />
i would love if you could explain why you think EXPERIMENTING by nature is good. and why it would breed success?<br />
Because it potentially gives us awesome new games in new genres instead of recreating the same old shit every 2 year? Dunno'... do i really have to explain why experimenting and pioneering is a good thing??!?! REALLY?!<br />
<br />
<br />
also who says quantity over quality is a bad thing?<br />
<br />
if you want to feed a starving nation quanity is better, if you can fill your 100,000 peoples stomaches with food to hold them off, good.<br />
<br />
but feed only 1000 with extravagant food that pampers their soul and spirit, the other 99,000 are going to be coming with pitchforks for your head.<br />
<br />
Aaaaaaand you went full retard. Never go full retard.... Comparing developing new and interesting games to feeding starving people. The first one is for recreation, it's a hobby and you obviously looking fro new and exciting things from time to time... the other is choosing between death and eating a mass produced item<br />
<br />

This is not a discussion about blizzard. This is a discussion about corporations. Cause unless you know frank personally, I dont think you have any right to say &quot;no he actually quit because of this!&quot; <br />
Frank said why he retired, and we have to go by that, unless your a friend of his and you didnt tell us? <br />
<br />
No this has nothing to do with blizzard and just has to do with the working world.<br />
<br />
Something surprising for many people here crying about a video game. But work is hard and when you get to your 50s and 60s if you have been working the same job for half your life. You get tired, you want change. Either you change jobs... Or you retire.<br />
<br />
I can't find his actual age, idk why, but based on the average age of those original founders of blizzard (who were 20-30 back in 1985) are now 50-60 years old on average... And that is normally retirement age, at least for those with a lot of money. <br />
<br />
But people working fast food won't experience that, people in charge of major roles in billion dollar companies will though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Reggie of Nintendo retired recently, does that mean Nintendo is failing? If not, then why does it mean blizzard is failing if one of their members retires? Because it fits an agenda, that's why.</div></div><hr />

Also they cared a ton about dota. Valve tried to trademark it and blizzard said &quot;lol how about fuck you valve&quot; then they had a dispute over it.<br />

It's a discussion about one of Blizzard's founders cashing out, less than a year after another founder cashed out.<br />
<br />
You can choose to take his words at face value if you want, just as you can choose to ignore the contextual significance of his departure. But no high level executive who is quitting a publicly listed company ever makes a public statement that is anything less than complementary and full of gratitude. Ever. Not unless something went seriously wrong and they are content to burn their bridges and risk tanking the share price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is an answer, but not a realistic one.<br />
<br />
The correct answer is to only hire gamers who have ONLY played, or have at least deeply played, the older titles like EQ, MUDs, AD&amp;D board games, etc.<br />
<br />
re-capture the spirit of what makes rpg's, adventures, etc fun and everything they can be.<br />

<br />
Answer: they won't.<br />
<br />
Also depends on what you consider &quot;quality&quot; games as there are generational differences of people who consider what quality is and is not.<br />
<br />
From my perspective, fans of the current iteration of WoW and it's numerous mini-game like content isn't really quality but I have seen younger people than I praise it.<br />
<br />
From your perspective, wanting Blizzard to go back to the good ole' days of like pre-2012? Not happening.</div></div><hr />

Aside from the fact that there's nothing official about Diablo 4 yet, Diablo Immortal is what caused the very first Booing crowd at a Blizzcon ever. That's proof right there that it's -not- fine.</div></div><hr />

Nah, man. going back to the past isn't a good idea. I mean WoW is behind the curve as it is. But the options aren't: Do old stuff well and do new stuff badly.<br />
<br />
My problem isn't with old people leaving. They earned their rest.<br />

At any rate WoW needs better class design and more talented writers. Especially when it comes to characters.</div></div><hr />

Funny thing is, the only reason I linked this video is cause Solus' introduction fits Pearce and Brack perfectly. But yes, FFXIV was utter trash till Yoshida came in and now Shadowbringers has near universal acclaim. So in theory the same can happen with WoW after BfA.<br />

Thanks for the Q, as i'm honestly not trolling ff14.<br />
<br />
I've tried it 2x now. once, i got talked into it at the very original launch so (RIP) i won't hold that against them.<br />
<br />
I tried it again about 4-5 months ago when i walked away from BFA, and it felt very slow, no world pvp i saw, and i ended up tapping out mid 20's. I must admit though i was tempted to just stick around for chocobo racing/breeding alone as i absolutely adored that.<br />
<br />
I honestly think it's a good game, and prolly gets great after the mid 20's i got stuck in motivation wise... but it may not be for me TBH, and that's ok.</div></div><hr />

Well yeah. Some people still liked the lore in the original version, but gameplay wise everyone hated it till 1.23 or so.<br />
<br />
As for 4-5 months ago... Yeah it doesn't really get spiced up in the first 20 levels. Probably which is why the trial goes to 35. I personally was a Final Fantasy fan so that helped me push.<br />
<br />
And yes, PvP is pretty weak. Duels can only happen in the dueling ring. FFXI had no PvP at all so even what we have now is an improvement, but there is absolutely no world pvp. Organized or otherwise. So if that's your thing it really is not your game. PVPers are like the only people I would discourage from playing the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The correct answer is to only hire gamers who have ONLY played, or have at least deeply played, the older titles like EQ, MUDs, AD&amp;D board games, etc.<br />
<br />
re-capture the spirit of what makes rpg's, adventures, etc fun and everything they can be.<br />

<br />
Yeah, i like wpvp and even think wow's Wpvp is far too tame. <br />
<br />
I play survival games outside of MMO's, and older MMO's where you can be permakilled or full looted so having no wpvp at all, or wpvp that means nothing is kinda jarring for me. no consequences for your actions in a world creates too artificial a world, where as in older or more free games if i trash talk you and you are higher than me.. you can just find me outside of town and end my existence.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit torn on FF as a series too tbh, i grew up with it and loved it but they lost me somewhere around the time they started putting voice actors in. FF15 was an improvement, but 13 remains my least favorite game of last generation. The only RPG in my life where i had to mute the tv when certain characters speaked. SO i have a love/hate relationship with FF.<br />
<br />
While i admit FF14 is not my cup of tea, i've never once insulted it. I just admit i tapped out mid 20's, but i've heard quite a bit that it picks up post 35+ when it leaves the ARR stuff behind but it's just so hard to motivate myself to get there. <br />
<br />
To each their own though, and i DO love the chocobo racing/breeding. I legit almost subbed another month just for that tbh. Absolutely genius and just good wholesome fun</div></div><hr />

Ion and them were actually top notch raiders in vanilla wow, not EQ. The team who designed vanilla WoW were the EQlive top raiders, and it showed in how they designed the game AS a world with haves and have nots.<br />
<br />
I would force the WoW team to do nothing but play old MUDs, AD&amp;D tabletop games, and EQ1 and older 90's RPG's until they recaptured the spirit of vanilla<br />

same. Besides, if anything he stuck around too long and if he was just gonna cash out like the other founder did... he should've done it when the other guy did last year when the stock was 50% higher.<br />

This is just a guy who's ready to move on, and has financial freedom to do so.<br />

The guy has made a ton of money, worked for a long time, and it makes total sense to retire or move onto something lighter. He worked there for 28 years. Tell me how many people work at a place for 28 years. Next to none. Hell that is probably longer than most people's lives discussing this. 28 years is a career. A good metric to use is the rule of 80 (age at retirement + years of service, in the USA) when it comes to retirement for an &quot;average retirement age in the US&quot; (typically mill/billionaires it can be a lot sooner and the range is typically 75-85 depending on company policies and regional standards). Let's say the guy was ONLY 20 years old when he started 28 years ago (I wager he was older). That means he is 48 years old now. Add 28 years of service. 48+28 = 76. Tack onto that the guy has an estimated value of nearing 1 BILLION dollars (here) (https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/frank-pearce-net-worth/). I think it's good enough to consider this well within the range of a normal retirement age.<br />
<br />
The move makes total sense. It makes total sense for almost all the founders to be doing this at this point. What's the point of working your whole life away when you got many millions or billions of net worth. Go enjoy the last 20-40 years of your life. Travel. Enjoy the family. Your rich.</div></div><hr />

It is that some of us do not like Blizzard's direction and we see the old guard leaving and more of them leave the bad decisions we see Blizard making thus it makes it look like they either decided to leave and stop arguing or that they were forced out. Anything could be true we don't know... <br />
<br />
All we know is Blizard games is not a good spot right now compared to the customers it had before. That being said I am hopeful the next expansion turns it around and the new patch isn't bad just the class design keeps me from playing or enjoying it.</div></div><hr />

It's the exact opposite for me. I vastly prefer classic and TBC ladder progression where you had to beat A to get to B, B to C, etc... rather than the seasonal &quot;play the patch&quot; type of WoW of today</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deferionus</div><div class="date">2019-07-21, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a company called Jagex Ltd that made a game called RuneScape that was a juggernaut MMORPG and still exists. What I can tell you is that after Andrew Gower, the majority share holder, sold his shares and retired as CEO of the company the game slowly implemented more MTX over time. You cannot log into the game now without having offers to buy spins.<br />
<br />
The leadership Blizzard has lost may not necessarily be significant in the day to day development done by developers but where they will be missed is as voices that hold back the tide of microtransactions that are currently plaguing the video game industry.<br />
<br />
Blizzards first game that was heavily MTX based in a negative way was hearthstone. You had a lighter fare of MTX with Heroes of the Storm and WOW cosmetics. You have Diablo Immortals on the horizon.<br />
<br />
What you need to watch is who controls the decisions over MTX implementation because games with over burdensome MTX blows ass for gameplay. We will see where this goes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sheppo</div><div class="date">2019-07-23, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What i read: &quot;i've worked for over 30 years and its time for me to enjoy my life and family again. Learn an instrument and i love you all&quot;<br />
