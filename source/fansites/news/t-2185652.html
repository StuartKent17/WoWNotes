The same goes for maxing out artifact weapons. Love the system, just as long as raids aren't tuned around it. Unfortunately they haven't done this, and it's creating problems as we move deeper into the expansion. Nighthold (mainly mythic) has created problems for raiding guilds due (in part) to this issue. We have great reliable raiders who have a wealth of experience, but not all of them have the time to max out 1-2 artifact weapon specs, nor the time to farm up legendaries. Alts are out of the equation entirely this time around if you're trying to maintain decent raid progression and manage all of the things that go with that, such as retention, motivation, etc. Mythic Emerald Nightmare had a nice natural progression. Mythic Nighthold does not.</div></div><hr />

They could even make it 1 spec per token.<br />
Example* I get a token for a ring , I am in Assassination spec. I can either &quot;use&quot; the item in my current spec OR switch specs to Sub or Outlaw, the token for that ring will STAY stated for whatever Spec I &quot;cashed it in/used&quot; it in.<br />
THey could even keep it Top 3 stats for the spec, so there is some wiggle for Stat weight changes during an xpac/tier<br />
ilvl STILL is not a clear indicator of what is best for your spec. in a lot of cases. even 20-30 ilvl increases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I call BS on that dev's entire statement because of the tokens from raid bosses. You can't equip a TOKEN at all. You have to go turn it in to get usable gear.<br />
<br />
The dev team is either just completely oblivious or purposefully deceitful in trying to justify something they want to do that doesn't make logical sense. They can't support it with logic, so they really should just honestly say that's the way they want it to be so deal with it. That's really what they're doing, but they're hoping they can trick players into believing it's better when it really isn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reforging made every upgrade more difficult to figure out, as you had to consider the base item and all of the variations you could make.<br />
<br />
Reforging also meant an interruption to your raid, as you had to go and reforge an item.What a complete load of horse shit.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team realized just how many set pieces they were missing when building the transmog set UI for Patch 7.2. Because they didn't quite get the message from the players ever since transmog was introduced?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you right-click a token it turns into the equivalent piece of gear. You don't have to go anywhere. (And in 7.2 that will apply to all tokens, not just Legion tokens.)</div></div><hr />

If Titanforging went away (or was capped at reasonable increases, say +5 for warforged, +10 for titanforged), players would get natually geared by doing progressively more difficult content.<br />
<br />
Its hard to balance gear or get meaningful progression when you can have random items jump 30-40 item levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm.. is this dude on drugs? <br />
<br />
Did he completely forget this is how the game was designed back then? We had stat weights because we had reforging. We had a lot more choice back then and a lot more variety with stats BECAUSE THATS HOW THE GAME WAS DESIGNED BACK THEN. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There used to be a stat priority list, now we have precisely calculated stat weights.<br />
<br />
Guess they haven't even bothered to look at Resto druid stat weights. Its a complete cluster fuck. Depends on what exact content you're doing, any item you get changes ALL your stat weights.. its a god damn nightmare, I have no clue what these buffoons are talking about.</div></div><hr />

The team is still looking at how they can bring back another trait on relics, while giving players more choice and control.<br />
So many possibilities. You could allow us to merge relics, or tie it with a profession and group content.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Reforging also meant an interruption to your raid, as you had to go and reforge an item. <br />
First of all, I can't believe this is still being discussed. If you have no plans to reintroduce the system, say so and stop bringing it back every couple months.<br />
Secondo, there was a mount that allowed you to reforge. You could also have added an engineering items that lets you reforge.. maybe a little robot or a consumable.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These Q&amp;A sessions show how much there needs to be a FAQ section on their website so they can answer real questions instead of rehashed stuff sprinkled with a little bit of new infos. You want to be better at communication with the public? Start with a compendium of where you can find vital informations rather than news spread all over the different social medias you guys use.<br />

well no 7.2 announcement, seems like it will be next week with the Q&amp;A so its confirmed, not coming this tuesday, but maybe the next? or first week of april<br />

The latest PTR is not even set to release candidate, so it wouldn't make sense to release it next week. My feeling is first week of april.</div></div><hr />

If you were only reforging one item whenever you got a new item you clearly weren't using Reforge to its fullest extent. What they said in the Q&amp;A did happen-- once you reforged one item you ended up reforging EVERYTHING.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Complete non-issue now that hit and expertise are removed. It reforged everything because it literally had to make up for the fact that you were either making up for either a gain or loss of either stats which would cause a domino effect across the board in most cases.<br />
<br />
If my Unholy Death Knight got an item with versatility and mastery, re-rolling that versatility in to haste would not cause a cascading effect on my other pieces or gear nor would it have to be done immediately since there is no longer a concern of whether or not I'll be missing my target.<br />

You don't have to go anywhere. (And in 7.2 that will apply to all tokens, not just Legion tokens.)<br />
<br />
If you right-click on an item, it opens the reforge menu to allow you to swap the stats around. You don't have to go anywhere.<br />
<br />
See? I can make it work just fine too.<br />
<br />
Hell, remember when we had points we could allocate to talents? Remember DnD type character creation where you get a certain number of stat points to allocate as you please? There is no reason an item couldn't drop with a default stat allocation, but the ability for you to shift stat points around. They could implement restrictions of how many other stats you could shift points to, but that's neither here nor there.<br />
<br />
They could even make it a starting quest with each expansion to acquire and upgrade your &quot;statmogrificator&quot; item that allows you to adjust item stats. By the time the first raid opens up, you'd have your ability to reforge on the fly. They could even make it a gold sink if they wanted by putting a certain charge limit on the reforgerthingy where you had to recharge it back in town (like durability).<br />
<br />
There are any number of ways they could fix itemization where a higher ilvl item is ALWAYS more powerful.</div></div><hr />

100% this. It's beyond belief that people still can't put 1 plus 1 together: with the hit and expertise gone, reforging would have been the ideal tool to let people customise their gear and have fun because changing items in 1 slot (or more) would not make you drop below the hit/expertise caps and start missing with your attacks. But in such an environment, reforging would be invalidating the bollocks RNG gearing systems that they've pushing since WoD and that's the real reason they removed it. All the rest is just nonsense.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Reforging also meant an interruption to your raid, as you had to go and reforge an item.&quot; and thats bs too. Reforging was great and there was really no reason to delete it.

Yeah? I thought that too when I read what Blizzard said. That's still not relevant to the comment I replied to, though, which was using an example that's not true anymore. If you meant that they should use a similar system for reforging, you should have said that instead.</div></div><hr />

All you said was that you can't equip a token and had to go turn it in to make it usable, which is untrue.

What hostility are you talking about? I mean no offense when I ask this, but are you autistic? I just need to know how to interact with you.<br />

You said I should have said that the reforging system could be made to work on the fly when quoting me where I said exactly that.<br />

The token change you refer to was made AFTER reforging was removed from the game. The point was that they removed reforging while leaving another broken system in the game instead of fixing reforging. Later, instead of removing tokens from the game, they fixed tokens. Now they talk about reforging using the exact same arguments against it that I used against tokens, but completely ignore the fact that they could have made the same changes to reforging that they did to tokens to fix reforging.<br />

Nope, this is exactly what you said:<br />
<br />
I call BS on that dev's entire statement because of the tokens from raid bosses. You can't equip a TOKEN at all. You have to go turn it in to get usable gear.<br />
<br />
The dev team is either just completely oblivious or purposefully deceitful in trying to justify something they want to do that doesn't make logical sense. They can't support it with logic, so they really should just honestly say that's the way they want it to be so deal with it. That's really what they're doing, but they're hoping they can trick players into believing it's better when it really isn't.<br />

The context was there. It was there since MoP. If you had any idea how MoP tokens, reforging, etc. have worked since the beginning of the game, I wouldn't have needed to spell it out to you. I'm not going to write a ten page proof for every post. If you don't understand what someone else is saying, then ask.

The same goes for maxing out artifact weapons. Love the system, just as long as raids aren't tuned around it. Unfortunately they haven't done this, and it's creating problems as we move deeper into the expansion. Nighthold (mainly mythic) has created problems for raiding guilds due (in part) to this issue. We have great reliable raiders who have a wealth of experience, but not all of them have the time to max out 1-2 artifact weapon specs, nor the time to farm up legendaries. Alts are out of the equation entirely this time around if you're trying to maintain decent raid progression and manage all of the things that go with that, such as retention, motivation, etc. Mythic Emerald Nightmare had a nice natural progression. Mythic Nighthold does not.<br />
<br />
I totally get where you're coming from, and it would be nice if it could work that way, but it really can't. They have to tune around that stuff or the raids become far too easy. And if the content becomes too easy, people clear the raids faster and quit faster to wait for the next tier, or not come back at all.</div></div><hr />

I knew about the change to tokens. Obviously. It was not clear if YOU did based on your post, however. Thus, I replied with the current information, in case you didn't know about it. If you want to argue against something effectively, you need to have up-to-date information, and it sounded like you were arguing with outdated information. But it seems like you just want to be angry and rant at someone, and my foolish attempt to help simply opened myself up as a target, so I'm not going to continue humoring you with replies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See? I can make it work just fine too.<br />
<br />
Hell, remember when we had points we could allocate to talents? Remember DnD type character creation where you get a certain number of stat points to allocate as you please? There is no reason an item couldn't drop with a default stat allocation, but the ability for you to shift stat points around. They could implement restrictions of how many other stats you could shift points to, but that's neither here nor there.<br />
<br />
They could even make it a starting quest with each expansion to acquire and upgrade your &quot;statmogrificator&quot; item that allows you to adjust item stats. By the time the first raid opens up, you'd have your ability to reforge on the fly. They could even make it a gold sink if they wanted by putting a certain charge limit on the reforgerthingy where you had to recharge it back in town (like durability).<br />
<br />
There are any number of ways they could fix itemization where a higher ilvl item is ALWAYS more powerful.<br />
<br />
Problem with that is that people will then start to reforge on a boss to boss basis, and im pretty sure they don't want to add more stuff to do pre-boss pulls.</div></div><hr />

Warforged and Titanforged was intended to make the upgrade feel like a bonus.<br />
<br />
Got 880 wrist from WQ when ToV was launched. <br />
That was with me until warforged heroic NH wrist, even then it was just 5 stat upgrade. Even tho I ran multiple +10 or +12 mythic dungeons during weekdays.<br />
Bonus is bonus but losing feel of getting something for harder content than cracking few nuts, gets boring fast =P<br />
<br />
<br />
The team is still looking at the tuning, maybe it is happening more than it should.<br />
<br />
TF is happening more than it should? If they nerf it I would actually be happy in a way. Less need to run M+ for that lucky BiS TF because &quot;it aint droppin anyway since nerf&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't need Warforged or Titanforged, you can move to a higher difficulty or mythic dungeons. <br />
<br />
No, but getting 900 titanforged items for your BiS trinkets and relics sure bloody helps.<br />

This, and timewalkin raids, was answered last QA btw. They are not doing it anytime soon because &quot;old mechanics&quot;. They mentioned they might &quot;look into&quot; classic dungeons they revamped like DM, SFK, Scholomance, Scarlet stuff etc. But as we know. Look into = Not on our list for few years<br />
<br />
As for Timewalk raids, never going to happen because &quot;they are balanced on old mechanics&quot;. You know, stuff like like threat mattering, mindcontrolling adds (oh wait BRF mythic), loads of trash, old abilities like remove enrage etc</div></div><hr />

I've bonus rolled several items which are BiS for others but complete garbage for me(or something i already had). The first member in our guild who got Whispers in the dark on HC managed to bonus roll it twice the following weeks..<br />

<br />
No, that's exactly the problem. You shouldn't need titanforged because you can move to a higher difficulty... but the higher difficulties had to be balanced around the fact that titanforging exists so the appropriate level for the content seems to be the same or higher than the gear that actually drops in that content. M+ feels balanced around the level of gear that drops from the weekly chest rather than the gear that drops in the dungeon.</div></div><hr />

Is it not? If game devs do not listen to the opinion of the masses... they will be voted out of designing a game altogether!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The vast majority of game design decisions, especially in MMORPGs, are never up to &quot;vote&quot; by players. For the simple reason that players will ask for more until they don't understand why they're bored. &quot;Players&quot; as a whole are too shortsighted to see long term consequences...<br />
<br />
WoD is actually a good representation of what happens if players gets too much of a say in how endgame should be. Since we 'don't want to be forced to farm' or anything else. Everything outside of raids should be 'optional'. <br />
<br />
Players think they want a lobby MMO-arcade until they get it. WoW would never have lasted this far if Blizzard caved in to every bandwagon riot the forums can conjure, such as removing AP because people can't live with themselves unless they're capped, etc.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZenX</div><div class="date">2017-03-17, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Literally the most pointless Q&amp;A ever. Practically nothing got answered and they want to drop the legendary rate? Are you serious? I thought the whole point was to be able to swap them. I play a lot and I only have 6, 4 of which are just utter crap, so I don't really have a lot of &quot;switching&quot; I can do -_-<br />
<br />
But yeah. Worthless Q&amp;A. Told us nothing new, completely ignored feedback/community (as usual), what a waste of time.<br />
<br />
Wow I had my doubts about it before but their answers here make it certain that those who are behind Legion's Itemisation are certainly clueless in what they are doing.<br />
<br />
I sort of did refute people's claims with regards to how game was being diablofied (And having played LoD since '04 till D3's release and hopping into it from time to time ever since, I can say D3 which I get to play at least every week for 4-8 hours is currently better than LoD) but by the answers given I am realising now that the situation is even worse.<br />
<br />
They did indeed integrated everything gruesome with D3 without having the faintest idea how they operate (a game that is light-years more dynamic as well as flexible than WoW allowing for such an itemization) and tried to shoe-horn it into game a that couldn't really take it, creating an abominable mess.<br />
<br />
If this is the way they are going to continue with this form of itemisation in place, they need to provide challenging solo content which have the same rewards are RNG-based and static-material base of the same caliber as those rewarded with organised higher-difficulty content. Why? This is how D3 matches this kind of itemisation with grouping being the factor in increasing scaling in difficulty per user while providing a small benefit in terms of rewards.<br />
But providing such a solo-system is absurd considering the holy-trinity of roles along with the game being an MMORPG with gating, not a solo ARPG with a highly scalable difficulty slider and unbound replay potential.<br />
<br />
This is pure incompetence. Its as if these designers' previous experience in itemisation is from Minecraft along with having any knowledge neither in WoW's nor Diablo's.<br />
<br />
Though again the horrible itemisation is the only problem I have with Legion with AP system being a part that I like. Having played this game since (mid to late) TBC, it really has been the best expansion of WoW for me aside from the whole itemisation ordeal.</div></div><hr />

Reforging lets players make items more optimal, but it isn't a great solution to the current problem of some higher item level items not being as good as lower item level items.<br />
Reforging made every upgrade more difficult to figure out, as you had to consider the base item and all of the variations you could make.<br />
Reforging also meant an interruption to your raid, as you had to go and reforge an item.<br />
<br />
It's actually an amazing solution the the current problem because it means the more stats are more globally more valuable, because you can always have at least some of your 'best' stat on a piece of gear.<br />
No it didn't. The issue you're talking about is hit/expertise/haste/crit caps and soft caps. Moreover, what is the relation to the problem of something that is a large item level upgrade (untradeable) being a performance downgrade?<br />
No it didn't. Actually never. If it did, how is that any different from getting an upgrade today that requires gems/enchants, or grabbing items out of the bank? This is just another excuse that doesn't address the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Titanforged and Warforged RNG<br />
Warforged and Titanforged was intended to make the upgrade feel like a bonus.<br />
If you are a Heroic raider and want to help out a friend in Normal, there is no chance of getting an upgrade. This system gives you a chance to get something that is an upgrade.<br />
The team is still looking at the tuning, maybe it is happening more than it should.<br />
You don't need Warforged or Titanforged, you can move to a higher difficulty or mythic dungeons.<br />
<br />
This would be true if warforge was a small bonus, such as 4 ilvl, and Titanforging was a slightly better bonus, such as 8 ilvl. Allowing an item to Titanforge to literally double the base stats is just absurd.<br />
There is still little-to-no chance of getting an upgrade. What this has actually created is that people who do not massively out-gear Normal/Heroic raids are quickly unable to join groups because the people who are running them for the low chance of item upgrades are not interested in 'carrying' appropriately geared players. Also, running with higher-geared party members increases the chance of them not needing an upgrade and sharing it.<br />
It is not happening more than it should. It simply shouldn't be so required. And it is required.<br />
Look above. It is required. I get 0 upgrades from M+ without a titanforge. I get 0 upgrades from Heroic NH without a Warforge. Most mythic raiders get 0 upgrades from Mythic raid without a Warforge. Am I supposed to just run a higher difficulty of +15 to get better gear?<br />
<br />
<br />
I actually kind of feel bad for ToddMatt. He obviously doesn't play or understand the game, but he was hired to perform some job at Blizzard, so he took it.

<br />
I don't mean to be Johnny Raincloud, but even with additional stats allotted to the duds, some Legendaries are still going to be categorically superior because of their bonus effects. I don't really see how they continue to deny or overlook this in such a blase way. Just as an example, Anger of the Half Giants and Delusions of Grandeur will be better than the Blur+Leech chest piece for Havoc simply because they smooth out the bad design of the class by increases resource generation and allow a powerful CD on a ridiculously long CD to be more in line with the other CDs. I don't care if you add Mastery to something, that is an incremental gain compared to the QoL benefits + overall benefit in terms of output.<br />
<br />
I understand that not every piece can be a winner, but some by design are clear losers. You can't tell me they didn't know Leech was inferior to more output. They went live with that incredibly lopsided, bad design. If nothing else they should have made every legendary impact one DPS/Heal/Defensive CD of the appropriate class, you could at least say &quot;Well this doesn't help my resource management, but I at least get more oomph from Blade Dance when I use it.&quot;<br />

Wait, what? What the hell is the point of them, then? These challenges, and their associated tints, were sold as being for people capable of demonstrating outstanding skill with their class. If they are not normalized, all they are going to demonstrate is that the person geared up sufficiently to trivialize it. Without gear normalizing, these tints lose their prestige, with mythic raiders getting them almost immediately and non-raiders being blocked from them likely until Argus, regardless of skill (and I say this as a mythic raider myself).<br />

Seriously, normalize these things. They don't reflect skill in the slightest if you can simply outgear them.</div></div><hr />

For instance, the Holy priest T19 2piece is stupid good. And it synergizes immensely with both T20 2piece and 4piece. I can easily imagine having all these equipped becomes absolutely MANDATORY to perform at the highest level. This pushes us away from ALOT of legendaries, and it would mean that you are forced to find legendaries that don't take up tier slots, which might be difficult for some who don't have these, and it also completely destroys our ability to pick and choose the legendaries we enjoy. I LOVE my Cloak legendary, but I could potentially feel forced to unequip it and insteas use Prydaz and Sephuz. I bet there can arise similar situations for other specs aswell.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't agree more. Right now there is no incentive to play on higher difficulty. As a mythic raider and loot distributer I often find myself disenchanting our loot from mythic raids because they are worse than what we did get by farming HC. They really should cap WF/TF to be max on par with higher difficulty (i.e. normal items ilvl can not be higher than HC items, etc.).</div></div><hr />

Unstable Arcanocrystal<br />
This trinket was over budget and nerfed once already.<br />
The team is very cautious about taking an item that people think is really good and making it so bad that people don't want to use it anymore. Doing so punishes people that have the trinket already.<br />
Someone who wanted the trinket, gets it, and it gets nerfed the next day would also be sad.<br />
<br />
This is so bull... what about paladins and convergence of fait? Oh right, this is only for one class so it's ok to nerf it once some ppl got it . But then what about Draught and warriors, still using it and a trinket on 3rd position on dps meters for them, WHY!?</div></div><hr />

Yep, and most of those things are gone from the game for good.<br />
<br />
Said it before but Reforging always got blamed for creating problems that it simply didn't. Reforging wasn't a pain. Trying to hit your caps was a pain. Reforging made doing it easier and more convenient. In a world without Reforging it was still necessary to use third-party sites to calculate your caps because caps were the problem, not Reforging.<br />

I agree with pretty much all of this, especially the PUG raids comment. The community is extraordinarily selfish and only want people to carry them. Of course idiots will say &quot;make your own group&quot; but unless you're a tank or healer, it will fail. More than once I've made my own group and just sat in LFG for 1-2 hours with 2-3 dps in the group and nobody joins. Most people expect a carry or for raids to be done in 15 minutes. This game's raid scene has become absolutely atrocious.</div></div><hr />

Even with normalising there are problems, like some classes / specs performing better in PGs than others. But without normalisation, there truly is no challenge.<br />
<br />
There is a reason that completing the Green Fire questline for warlocks granted no title after a certain point in the timeline. And while overgearing this challenge has been there to some extent, skill was definitively important. I got the title on my warlock, with a bit of overgearing (TI items with basic item levels, some with upgrades, single pieces from SoO LFR, and probably one crafted item). A friend of mine was at about the same gear level, but he did not manage to kill the final boss before they removed the option to get the title. So, I either was practicing the fight more, or was better at playing warlock at that time, or both.<br />
<br />
Let's see how this will turn out... my best geared character is at ilvl 884. :/<br />

If they're normalised many people (majority?) won't be able to acquire them at all. W/o normalisation bad players will eventually be able to use gear to compensate for their lack of skill, otherwise they won't be able to get it at all.<br />
<br />
And obv they don't want to have yet another case of &quot;Balance of Power&quot; skin and tints. For instance, one of &quot;challenge&quot; tints is unlocked quite easily, you simply have to kill all dungeon bosses while using challenge skin. Others require doing rated BGs and killing KJ HC (boosters are REALLY happy about this one :D). I guess they don't want acquisition of the skin being harder than acquisition of one of its tints.<br />
<br />
Blizz designers tend to balance content that's available to everyone around lowest common denominator.<br />

<br />
IIRC, that's one of few reasons why they removed it, they didn't like how decision making process was automated by addons. Blizzard doesn't like this kind of things in general :p<br />
<br />
If that is their stance then they should limit boss fights ( normal/hc or mythic ) to a push one button and stand still, because without addons killing some of them is kinda like winning the lottery.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that's the reason why they've been limiting addons in raid/combat environments since late Vanilla / TBC launch :p<br />
<br />
If things go too far, they gut/restrict API, if this approach is impossible, they just don't use feature in question in later expansions (reforging case).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was only because of hit and expertise caps.<br />
If they re-introduced reforging now, you'd only need to do the one item, not everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah but thats why they added mass milling, why they are now adding option to take all mail from mailbox ( after 12 years ), and so on. Some addons are there to show blizzard that people that are not on they pay list have more brain and common sense what this game needs in order to help people. Not to give them unfair advantage just a little bit of help.<br />
<br />
BEcause of that i think the reason they told us why they removed reforging is BS, It has to do with playing more in order to get perfect gear combo while with reforge you could just drops stats you dont need and go for stats you do need. Less time playing in farming dungeons and so on...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jonuts</div><div class="date">2017-03-17, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reforging also meant an interruption to your raid, as you had to go and reforge an item. <br />
<br />
Like this can't be implemented on a mount. Not only that, but it was only a major issue because hit and expertise caps were extremely important, meaning you had to constantly reforge nearly all your gear. Reforging would be a fucking godsend right now without that shit making a hot mess of it.<br />

The team likes dungeon trinkets being useful.<br />
<br />
Not gonna lie. The team can go eat a bag of dicks. All my BiS raid trinkets are...dungeon trinkets. Fuck you team. Fuck you. I suppose this wouldn't be a problem if I was actually excited to run Halls of Valor on Mythic + until my eyes bleed every time the ilvl cap from Mythic + goes up, but I'm not. I'm really, *really* not.</div></div><hr />

Secondary stats removed.<br />
<br />
Sounds drastic but i'd support this. That would mean ilvl upgrade = equip it no matter what. I can't think of one single benefit secondary stats on gear adds to the game. They should do simple spec specific secondary stats templates players cannot influence directly. i'm so fed up with constantly circling around the question if an item is and upgrade or not, meeting must have breaks points etc.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goldenboy1</div><div class="date">2017-03-17, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back in WOD when mythic dungeons were released, I was adamantly against it. Players were being rewarded with high ilv gear for little effort. The end result was inflated ilvs resulting in unskilled players with little experience being picked over veterans due to a slight ilv difference. Currently gear does not equal skill, a general sense for performance, or even progression. The current warforged/titanforged mechanics ruined character progression. An item from helping Grandma Tauren kill off some grubs is sometimes better than an item received after defeating the Corrupted Bear God Ursoc. In Emerald Nightmare the expansion was new and this was not a massive issue. However, look at Mythic Nighthold. The gear being dropped is competing with ToV, dungeon, WQ, and Emerald Nightmare gear due to this system. Additionally, upgrades have been largely marginalized to the point where seven or eight players receiving gear upgrades did little to help the transition from progression to farm. <br />
<br />
Reforging was not a godsend system in the past. However, currently reforging will be an excellent solution to secondary issues. An item of superior level, which is supposed to be indicative of power, may be worse due to the stats on the item. With reforging players can now select from a range of items dropped from high end content while preserving their secondary stats. Secondary stats are exactly as the name suggests, secondary. Gearing should not be focused on a secondary item component. <br />
<br />
The relic system is a failed design. The drops translate to three &quot;weapon&quot; drops. This concept is not too awful since relics drop from more bosses than weapons did in the past. The main issue is that there are BIS relics, not a BIS weapon. Sometimes, a raid does not even have your BIS relic which leads players to selecting relics from old content which is toxic to a progression based MMO. <br />
<br />
Overall old content needs to return to its &quot;old&quot; status. Players should not be carrying over titanforged items recieved months ago in place of new items from the most difficult content. Dungeons were designed to be a gate way to low end raiding in order to provide players with some items to start raiding. The order for progression, gear included, was max level- dungeons- Lfr- normal raiding- heroic raiding- mythic raiding. Once you hit mythic raiding you only had heroic trinkets or tier pieces that carried over until they were replaced. Now in Legion at that mythic level you still use dungeon items, normal items, heroic items, and now even world quest items.</div></div><hr />

It was not clear if YOU did based on your post, however. Thus, I replied with the current information, in case you didn't know about it. If you want to argue against something effectively, you need to have up-to-date information, and it sounded like you were arguing with outdated information. But it seems like you just want to be angry and rant at someone, and my foolish attempt to help simply opened myself up as a target, so I'm not going to continue humoring you with replies.<br />
<br />
Dude. Get over it. Seriously. You're the only one ranting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Problem with that is that people will then start to reforge on a boss to boss basis, and im pretty sure they don't want to add more stuff to do pre-boss pulls.<br />
<br />
That's not a problem. You're doing like the devs and fabricating imagined problems. Some guilds could make everyone join a Skype video conference session to do yoga before every boss if they wanted to. That doesn't make it a problem to worry about.<br />
<br />
You can still leave the raid to redo your talents between bosses if you really want to. That doesn't mean you're going to or that it's even a problem worth worrying about.</div></div><hr />

I mean, isn't that the point of the challenge skin? That it indicators you're particularly good at your class, that you've mastered it in an above-average way? That's how they were sold.<br />
<br />
Without gear normalization, though, the skins actually indicate that you're particularly geared, and as a result will automatically become less and less prestigious over time as power creep from new content eventually trivializes them.<br />
<br />
Without gear normalization, you can't even call them challenge skins, because it's not based around a challenging scenario, it's based on a scenario requiring a certain amount of gear to be trivial.<br />

Hell, I've been advocating for ages to add the reforging interface back into the same window as socketing. You shift-right-click the item, select the stat to reforge from and to, commit, done. Make the first reforge (ie. from an item that's never been reforged) free and any time (out of combat), and then make changing an item's reforging have the same requirements as changing talents: out of combat and in a rested zone or under the effects of a tome or codex. Problem solved. No NPCs needed, no issues with interrupting raids (because new items that drop can be immediately reforged while out of combat without restrictions), and puts the same restrictions on changing your reforging before every boss as exist on changing your talents before every boss.<br />

W/ gear normalisation they'd have to undertune them, e.g. PG Silver difficulty, so majority of people would be able to complete them. So why bother?<br />
<br />
You can't make content that's available to everyone and that's kinda supposed to be done by everyone to be really difficult, LFR is a good example of content tuning for masses. For many among its target audience not standing in fire is a challenge.<br />

RNG is the dumbest shit, I've run dungeons, heroics, and Mythics as a tank, and have got no loot in the past. How does that HELP me? It doesn't. It makes it harder for me to get better gear.<br />

Blizzard is not about helping you. The longer you have to play the more money they make and the less stress is put on them making something new.<br />

It's actually an amazing solution the the current problem because it means the more stats are more globally more valuable, because you can always have at least some of your 'best' stat on a piece of gear.<br />
No it didn't. The issue you're talking about is hit/expertise/haste/crit caps and soft caps. Moreover, what is the relation to the problem of something that is a large item level upgrade (untradeable) being a performance downgrade?<br />
No it didn't. Actually never. If it did, how is that any different from getting an upgrade today that requires gems/enchants, or grabbing items out of the bank? This is just another excuse that doesn't address the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This would be true if warforge was a small bonus, such as 4 ilvl, and Titanforging was a slightly better bonus, such as 8 ilvl. Allowing an item to Titanforge to literally double the base stats is just absurd.<br />
There is still little-to-no chance of getting an upgrade. What this has actually created is that people who do not massively out-gear Normal/Heroic raids are quickly unable to join groups because the people who are running them for the low chance of item upgrades are not interested in 'carrying' appropriately geared players. Also, running with higher-geared party members increases the chance of them not needing an upgrade and sharing it.<br />
It is not happening more than it should. It simply shouldn't be so required. And it is required.<br />
Look above. It is required. I get 0 upgrades from M+ without a titanforge. I get 0 upgrades from Heroic NH without a Warforge. Most mythic raiders get 0 upgrades from Mythic raid without a Warforge. Am I supposed to just run a higher difficulty of +15 to get better gear?<br />
<br />
<br />
I actually kind of feel bad for ToddMatt. He obviously doesn't play or understand the game, but he was hired to perform some job at Blizzard, so he took it. I just wish that they'd check their ego at the door and spend some time looking at feedback instead of repeatedly spewing their uninformed excuses and destroying the game that they were hired to maintain.<br />
<br />
have to agree with you on Lore. bring back alienna and we are golden.<br />

Hitting the bullshit button on &quot;having to stop the raid to reforge&quot;. Not one piece was so vital that you need to stop the raid just to go get it reforged.</div></div><hr />
