Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Dear world, if you react hyperbolically to even modest (3-5%) nerfs, then it makes it hard for us to tell when you are really concerned. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383036763989479425))<br />
<br />
one way to deal with button bloat would be more abilities that &quot;replaces X&quot; (fist of justice for example).<br />
Considered that, but if the ability only gets better, it feels weird to rename it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383753704051986432))<br />
On the other hand, if the abilities pick up extra effects with every replacement, the tooltips get really complex. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383753780618997760))<br />
<br />
this statement leaves me wondering what the point of the PTR is? This could have, and should have, been easily answered in PTR<br />
PTR catches a lot but it doesn't catch everything. There are millions more players raiding now than participated on PTR. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383009990266466304))<br />
maybe if you didn't ignore class forums, you'd have picked this up as far back as 4.2 PTR when players picked it up<br />
I just now looked at class forums. My conclusion: every class is benched and need buffs. How to know which claims to believe? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383038449181134848))<br />
What about your much touted internal tracking systems that you've claimed are better than ranks/census/etc?<br />
What I have always tried to say is that our internal tools are quite sophisticated, but no substitute for actual data. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383040989738192896))<br />
Hardcore raiders forget that most players want to feel competitive, but their competitive =/= hardcore definition<br />
I think you can be competitive and not hardcore. I guess it depends on your definitions. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383752203850117122))<br />
<br />
why do you need data from millions of players? Just check what the top 1-10 guilds do on ptr ?<br />
That is a data point of course, but not the only data point. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383037322029039616))<br />
Consider that not everyone can deliver on the DPS that a top 10 guild can provide. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383037428044279808))<br />
Also consider that those guilds are more focused on learning fights (without tipping their hand) than testing DPS for us. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383037538278965248))<br />
<br />
RE:Hit/xpt caps being tedious and fiddly. Consider hit over cap -&gt; cirt rating, xpt over cap -&gt; haste rating? Too left field?<br />
Not too left field. Games have done similar things successfully IMO. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383010152258883585))<br />
<br />
I haven't seen one comment addressing this nerf, but a ton of responses to nonsense...<br />
We do nerfs and buffs when damage doesn't match our targets, which was the case for Brewmaster. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383006884082352128))<br />
We don't really want to get in the mode of justifying or asking permission to make changes we think are necessary. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383007039644897280))<br />

Across 9 kills of Thok25H, 225 players, there have been only 2 mages. Bad encounter design or bad class design?<br />
Remember when seeing first week heroics that players are vastly undergeared. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382257754628296704))<br />
Given that, they often have to resort to creative or even degenerate strategies to have a chance at victory. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382257887117987840))<br />
If there are few mages on Thok H in 3-4 weeks, then it's a problem we need to address on the class or enc side. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382258066038616064))<br />

Greg please, can i get a fair answer for why Evil eye of galakras is not reducing holy avenger cooldown? I need to understand.<br />
IIRC only warrior talented CDs are affected. HA in particular might make the other talents less desirable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382253724149628928))<br />

&quot;We didn't buff you because you campaigned&quot; &quot;we err'd in your favor because you were concerned&quot;<br />
Players delight in gotchas, which ultimately risks designers having to communicate less like people &amp; more like robots. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383751517754257409))<br />
<br />
SP's are great in multi-target fights, however single target fights we fall far behind, even more when movement is involved.<br />
It is not a goal for all specs to tie in all situations. We fear that would erode class diversity quite a bit. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383040486174253057))<br />
Historically, multidotting has been really effective. But if single target dotting is also effective, why play a non dot? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383040750155358208))<br />

what buffs you giving Demo to compensate the drastic nerfs? Affliction is way higher, but left unchanged?<br />
There were Affliction nerfs too: UVLS and Haunt. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383038142946619393))<br />
I don't understand the UVLS nerf, sure it was a decent trinket, but 40% is like using a cannon to kill an ant.<br />
The alternative was just nerfing warlock DPS by more, which didn't feel fair to those not using the trinket. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383752797532864512))<br />
<br />
Can you please figure out how to balance warlock pve dmg.Once again they are are too far ahead. Or should we just accept it?<br />
We are concerned it's too high, but we are trying to figure out how much of it is just the UVLS trinket. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382250448750522368))<br />

Where was this tension when you decided to gut rage from damage and replace it with static rage generation?<br />
The rage from dmg model just wasn't working. Warriors were too weak and slow with bad gear and ignored rage with good gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382257391787454464))<br />
Wait, since when was that a problem? Classes should get their time in the sun. Rage isn't supposed to be energy.<br />
I don't think &quot;I suck in 5.0 and 5.2 but rule in 5.4&quot; is a very fun model for anyone, including the warrior. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/383035513361281025))<br />

In our previous blog, we covered some of the nitty-gritty facts about the wipe and what exactly it entails. It’s an exciting time for the Hearthstone team, since this wipe will coincide with our first major closed beta patch for both the Americas and Europe regions. Our update covers a wealth of bug fixes and quality of life improvement within Hearthstone, and today we’ll be sharing some of the highlights of this upcoming patch. Many of these changes are based on feedback that you, our valued community, provided to us on the forums.<br />
<br />
Daily Quests<br />
We’ve gotten a lot of comments on quests. The community has discovered some fun hidden quests, but some of our daily quests have frustrated those of you who have quests that don’t correspond to your favored class. After the patch, daily quests that require you to win with a specific class will now give you a choice between two classes, allowing you some additional flexibility.<br />
<br />
Balance<br />
Class balance has been a hot topic, with many of you commenting on the strength and versatility of the Rogue class compared to other classes, such as the Warrior and Priest. Rogues will have some key spells and minions adjusted to bring them more in line with the other classes. Warriors and Priests will find themselves with new tools and improved cards to round out their arsenal, and we’ve made some adjustments to the other classes here and there as well. We’ll be publishing our full patch notes so you can review these and other changes to the heroes of Hearthstone in full detail.<br />
<br />
Golden Cards<br />
Golden cards are fun to collect in Hearthstone, and a cool way to show off your accomplishments. Many golden cards have been updated with new animations, and there are still more to come. If you’ve helped test our in-game store and acquired your new forever-friend Gelbin Mekkatorque, check out his shiny new animation! In addition to the new animations to Golden cards, we have also added the ability to unlock Golden Basic minions at higher experience levels. Now you can shoot for creating a 100% golden card deck to really dazzle your opponent!<br />
<br />
Crafting<br />
We’ve received a lot of feedback regarding the crafting system, and how the crafting interface didn’t feel quite as intuitive as it should have been. Crafting is intended to be easy to access and a fun way to craft new cards for your collection, and we want that to be noticeable right away to the new player. We’ve updated the UI for our crafting system, so making cards for your collection should be even easier than before! Click the “Crafting Mode” button to access the updated crafting UI.<br />
<br />
Social Improvements<br />
We’ve improved our chat functionality to make it more streamlined and easier to interact with your friends. We’ve also introduced Toasts: they’re a cool addition to our social features that let your friends know when you’ve done something awesome in-game, like open a Legendary card or complete an Arena run. Combine these two improvements together and you’ll never miss an exciting moment with your card-slinging friends in Hearthstone!<br />
<br />
Play Mode and Arena<br />
Finally, we’re aware that a lot of discussion on the forums is revolving around Play and Arena mode, and how to make them more compelling for players to participate in. We’ve changed experience and leveling so you can max out your Hero at level 60 and earn experience in any game mode up to max level. This includes Play mode (ranked or unranked), Practice, matches against friends, and the Arena.<br />
<br />
The rate that you acquire gold has been one of the other most-commented on topics on our forums. This patch will improve the gold output of Play mode, changing the gold generation rate from 5 gold per five wins to 10 gold per three wins. We will be monitoring this update as we progress further into closed beta and will continue to make changes as needed.<br />
<br />
We’ve made significant changes to the Arena as well: In general, rewards gained will include less dust and more cards, as well as guaranteeing more gold for both five and six Arena wins. To further entice you to become an Arena Grand Master, an extra pack OR a golden card is now guaranteed at nine wins.<br />
<br />
Full patch notes will be available alongside the patch, which will include the collection wipe. For more information on the wipe and what that entails, please read our blog here (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/blog/11100276)! Thank you for your continued feedback as we continue the closed beta testing phase of Hearthstone.<br />

Chinese kill doesnt count to world first because they use different mechanics. its as different of a fight from the one Method did as ToT or Mogushan is.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
World first is not Method. The Asian guild got world first. Yes, they are part of &quot;The World&quot;.<br />
<br />
Actually, no they are not part of &quot;The World&quot;. Chinese servers are not ran by blizzard, and do not use the same rules set or mechanics that all other regions use. They have completely different gear, and use completely different raid lockouts. Calling their kill the world first is like calling PTR kills &quot;World First&quot; because its the literal first.</div></div><hr />

Keep showing how unintelligent you are by thinking the Asian kill was anything more then an Asian First.<br />
If you guys weren't so &quot;blind&quot; you would know that it's not even a World First 10 HC, unless no other region kills it in 10 mans for let's say 2/3 weeks.<br />

They have completely different gear, and use completely different raid lockouts. Calling their kill the world first is like calling PTR kills &quot;World First&quot; because its the literal first.<br />

In that case, why didn't the Chinese guild get a &quot;World First&quot; nod for their accomplishment? Using your Special Olympics analogy, it's not like the first place finisher there wouldn't get a gold medal just because they weren't in the real Olympics...<br />

If they were just on different servers with the same rules it would be a fair comparison. However because they play with different rules, it is a similar sport, but a different event. They play with different rules than the rest of the world therefore, therefore their first is an Asian first.</div></div><hr />

Historically, multidotting has been really effective. But if single target dotting is also effective, why play a non dot? (Source)*<br />
<br />
Maybe because they can dot/do damage while running? Can take more damage? Can blink? Have pets? Have portals? Seriously...as if the only difference(or to be exact: The only thing where shadows fall short) between shadows and the rest is that they do less damage on single targets.<br />
I wonder in which game this dude is playing if he believes that everyone while reroll shadow if they start doing some serious damage on single targets....<br />

Not to mention, that if they would worry so much about diversity...why did they give self-healing to every single class? For what do we have hybrids if every class can do that by now...while it got nerfed time after time for hybrids?</div></div><hr />

You ARE aware that asian realms have 2 lockouts per week and have higher ilvl gear drop for them right?<br />
note: when gear drops on US/EU its 0/2 and with VP goes to a 2/2 upgrade. Gear in Asia drops at 2/4 and is upgradable to 4/4 with vp upgrades.<br />
But im sure you omitted that bit of information to make your point right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They get double lockouts and can run both 10 and 25 mans (way more loot). Their 25 mans drop higher ilvl gear (better loot). 10 mans are intentionally easier than 25 mans on Asian servers. So more gear, better gear, and an easier mode. Its not the same race.</div></div><hr />

Its not about 25 or 10 in general. Its mostly about Asia still have the WotLK raid rules, where 25 man gets higher ilvl then 10 man.<br />
So 25 man heroic guild killing 10 man heroic is kind of a cheat that should not be taken into global rankings whatsoever.<br />

<br />
While the asian servers gets 2 lockouts, better gear in 25m wich means.. they can &quot;cheat&quot; their way to 10m HC. 25M HC is the real problem for the asian servers, thats why they havn't killed it on 25m yet. <br />
Only 25m on the asian servers can be counted as a &quot;worlds first&quot; since its harder than 10m, and it evens out.<br />

<br />
I'd have to argue that the Chinese guild that killed heroic Garrosh on 10m. . .was the first guild in the world to kill him on heroic. <br />
<br />
Different rules and lock outs/ilvl advantage? Yeah sure then they don't count for the world's race (between EU and US) because the Chinese servers have a blatantly clear advantage compared to the rest of the world, BUT it doesn't change the fact that heroic Garrosh was already killed on a live Blizzard server. Chinese guild having an advantage doesn't change that fact. You can ignore it all you want, but it already happned :l<br />
<br />
Edit: Looks like a lot of us are defining &quot;World First&quot; in different ways. I'm personally taking it in a literal sense (first time the boss died on a live Blizzard server). Then others are defining it as the first based on the world's race (like between EU and the US) which makes more sense cause it's competitive play between guilds. . .gives more value to &quot;World First&quot; kills. In any way you look at it, I would NOT consider any guild playing on a Chinese server part of any race whatsoever. . .unless their rules are changes to match the rest of the world. Thus, while I consider the first kill belonging to the Chinese guild, Method's kill is of GREATER value.<br />
<br />
You can also be a prick and define &quot;World First&quot; as the first PTR kill. . .believe most of us are basing it on live servers though, so it makes for a horrible analogy :/</div></div><hr />

Yeah, because massive gearchecks and farm more resistance gear were the most hardcore things ever.:rolleyes: If any of the Vanilla/TBC bosses were released today, in a new raid, they would die in the first week, if you didn't put some gearcheck/resistance barrier in there.</div></div><hr />

WOTLK had seperate 10 mans and 25 mans just like the Asian guild had. WOTLK 10 mans awarded 10 man loot with lower ilvl than 25 man loot. Most guilds that raided 25 mans also raided 10 mans on the side. In the west as new tiers came out the 25 man guilds went in and killed all 10 man bosses with 25 man gear. It was quite easy, seeing as pretty much everyone overgeared it. Paragon killed LK10 on heroic with their 25 hc gear, Ensidia killed Algalon on 10 man with their 25 man gear. And nobody cared, because 10 mans were easier. <br />
<br />
As soon as people start to realize that the Asian guild killed the 10 man Garrosh with their 25 man gear, that Asian guild will be forgotten. I also think that some of this is mmo-champion's fault, because they didn't state this clearly enough in their news post about the 10 man kill. &quot;The group had a 573+ item level&quot; isn't enough, because most people (assuming most people means the average player) don't know what that means.</div></div><hr />

If you followed the race stats you could clearly see that there were way more 25 guilds with x/14 at any time than in the 10m column. So I'm not surprised a 25m guild won the race. Pity for paragon that they had to go 10m this expansion, otherwise they definitely would have won this race.<br />
<br />
When Paragon gets world first doing 10m, they are better; but when a 25m gets world first, 25m is easier? You can't have it both ways.</div></div><hr />

But honestly, the game is very different between the two regions. Both deserve kudos, but Method get the slightly bigger one. When a Chinese guild kills 25H then cool - but they've still not done it despite having more gear (that overcompensates the increased hp and damage, honestly, due to double dipping and how ilevels scale).<br />
<br />
The difference between the two is like the 100m sprint and the 110 meter hurdles.<br />

That isn't what was said, now was it? Come on, let's be honest! What did the person you're reply to say?<br />
<br />
10 man is clearly struggling a bit more then 25 man at this stage. Balancing is never going to be perfect, of course, but it seems the rate of Warforged gear drops really is making it a somewhat difficult gearcheck for 10 man guilds. Not to mention lack of class stacking and being able to more easily gear up characters during the first weak of normal clears.<br />
<br />
I think 25 man needs a slight increase in difficulty. Not much, just a little. Even 1% increased hp and damage would make the fights MUCH harder.<br />

If that Asian guild got the kill on 25 which at least has it's difficulty adjusted for the obvious gear jump then it would be relevant even if there would be some change in difficulty. But give any of the top 20 EU/US 10 man guilds the same gear as they had and you'd have 20 Garrosh kills in a night or two. They stepped out of their native difficulty just to grab an easy kill, since they do actually share lock outs in China from what I understand they would have sacrificed a week in the real race in 25 to push for a kill in 10 which awards them with a raid clear with very little of use (gear being lower than it's 25 man counterparts). Not that I can be bothered checking but I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't even ranked particularly well among even just the Asian guilds in previous tiers I mean what type of guild shoots themselves in the foot for the actual race sacrificing a week of 25 prog/gearing just for the sake of a kill nobody will remember. Asia has plenty of really solid guilds I mean Stars took down a boss the west assumed was impossible and I wish the game was tuned the same so we could have a proper competition, but people going on about a kill that I doubt is taken that seriously by the players in the region is just stupid.</div></div><hr />

It shouldn't be a discussion at all. Asia 10 mans are as important as WOTLK 10 mans were, and they didn't matter at all because they were lower difficulty because of 25 man gear.<br />

10 mans isn't the end game for the Chinese players, all their focus is on 25 mans. 25 mans is the end game, just as it was in WOTLK. They are not cheaters, they aren't excluded, but they killed a 10 man boss with 25 man gear.</div></div><hr />

Yes. world means world and first means first. Even if they had the ability to 1 shot the boss with only 1 player in the raid they still killed the boss first. <br />

World First (EU/US client) perhaps... But it's not a world first. On the EU/US client yes its the world first on that but not overall.</div></div><hr />

Not gonna use the A word, but it would clearly fit you.<br />
If you refuse to play by the same rules everyone else does, you are not in the competition. Do you understand this?<br />
You can not play in a CS:GO tournament without recoil or a DOTA tournament with stronger items and a revealed map.<br />
If you even tried to pull anything like that, they'd bar you from entering those competitions EVER again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as for the people saying the asia kill was not a legit world first, if next week some group manage to kill it with all SoO normal gear (no heroic loot) do we take the method &quot;world first&quot; away because &quot;omg they totally had more gear&quot;? or say if a guild that started raiding SoO kills the 25man HC in less weeks (IE, less resets) do we also take method's world first away? think about that will you?<br />
<br />
No because it isn't just about gear but playing within the same rules as everyone else else. Asian severs have a completely different setup and rules for raids and loot to the rest of the world. It would be like allowing an Olympic cyclist to enter the 100 meter dash event with his bike against a group of sprinters.<br />
<br />
If you want to contend for the gold, you have to abide by the same rules as everyone else. As Asian servers do not do that, you cannot realistically place them in the running. It's just silly to even think that you can. They are practically playing a completely different game.</div></div><hr />

I know its such a simple difference yet people just cannot seem to comprehend it. Is it that hard to see that US/EU only gets 1 reset a week compared to the CH getting 2 resets a week? 1 reset a week = 1 chance to get the gear they need (and bonus rolls) compared to the 2 resets a week = twice as much chance (twice as much bonus roll) to get the gear they need? And not only that, on top of that, they have a 'separate' lockout for both 10 and 25 man version. Doubled double! O.O<br />
<br />
What is so hard to comprehend who has the upper hand in gearing themselves in a weeks time? -_-<br />

<br />
They do not base it on who actually killed it first current time. Theyre all based on when the raid came up. Theoretically if US killed the first boss in heroic in 12 hours after the server was up, it will be the same category as when EU's kill was made when the server was up... So if EU killed the first boss in 11 hours when the server first came up, regardless of time zone differential, EU got the world first kill on that boss, mmkay? :)</div></div><hr />

And if they defeated the harder version of the boss (25 man) then this conversation would likely not be happening.<br />
<br />
They took the higher loot from the harder bosses and killed the boss that was the same difficulty as the EU/US (10 man).</div></div><hr />

Rules are made by wowprogress (essentialy counting the points. While also taking in account the 24h headstart US have on Eu. Asia having obviously its own race), blizzard (asia having way more raid ID per week and harde bosses in 25. And also boss exploiting leading to ban and achievement stripping) and common sens.<br />
<br />
But yeah. You can make your own rules where differents raid systems are in a same race. We don't care.</div></div><hr />

And it's common sense, Sausage. The majority rules. One region of ALL the regions plays by a different set of rules, while 80% of the rest of the game plays by the &quot;real&quot; rules. North American company, North American version.</div></div><hr />

Being on steroids is cheating. Using more gear that Blizzard gives you is not cheating. Not hard to understand. It's like saying the olympic committee is giving asian countries a headstart on the race but the rest of the world's countries don't. If that happened and an asian competitor one there would be outrage but it would still count, it would not be cheating because it's their game their rules. And people saying Asia doesn't count unless Blizzard changes the lockouts in the west. How about the west doesn't count unless Blizzard changes the lockouts in the east. They were literally the first guild in the world to kill him on live servers. The end. If you don't like that and want it changed go to the battlenet forums and either ask that they go back to one lockout in the east (they won't they get twice as much money now) or give us double lockouts in the west.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing to be done is list the winners of each 'race' separately, just like 10 and 25 is currently (at least by rational people).<br />
<br />
Loot accumulation is a key mechanic that drives progression (along with iteration, organization etc.). If Blizzard accelerates it for a segment of WoW's population, that segment needs to be tracked separately for the purposes of progression.<br />
<br />
All of this hate needs to be directed towards Blizzard IMO.</div></div><hr />

The Chinese guild even cheated by their own standards using the 25 man guild to funnel the gear into the 10 man kill (25 too hard). Only trolls would view that kill as world first. <br />

The same trolls would call Method out for cheating if they re-rolled on Asia servers and did the same thing.</div></div><hr />

But it IS different. Different lockouts, different gear, different bosses, different rules. I don't think it's fair to Asia, they have very good players who should be able to compete and I'd like to see them compete because more competition is better. I take nothing away from them and grats to the Asia guys who killed Garrosh in their region but it's different, whether it's fair or not, it IS different. It's the same as how EU has advantages. They have more people and thus a larger recruitment pool. On top of that, their working conditions are better too because they have more lax rules when it comes to vacation and stuff. These are NUMBERS. Numbers don't lie. It's different in that it still counts for 'world first' because the 'sandbox' of the game is still the same, they just have more people and less restrictions on how to play in the sandbox because of reality (Which Blizz can't do anything about.)</div></div><hr />

Asians competes with the west in 25man. 25man gives server's first in Asia, hence 25man is where the competetion is. The hardcore Asian guilds competes in 25man, but Method killed him first in 25man. Not that difficult to understand.</div></div><hr />
