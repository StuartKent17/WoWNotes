<br />
Crucible of Storms Release - April 16<br />
The raid isn’t at all part of their unlock requirements. Zandalari and Kul Tirans will be out the day the patch releases.<br />
Correct.<br />
<br />
Also, the current plan is for Crucible of Storms Normal/Heroic to open on April 16, 2019, and Mythic/Raid Finder to begin a week later on April 23.<br />
<br />
Battle of Dazar’alor is still quite new – a majority of organized raiders are working their way through their initial preferred difficulty, with higher difficulties to follow for many, and the final Raid Finder wing of Battle of Dazar’alor just opened this week.<br />

Not wanting to open a fucking TWO BOSS RAID because one is &quot;fairly new&quot; is a poor excuse for timegating. But sadly people eat it up these days so /shrug.<br />

I would agree with you if more people had cleared BoD Mythic or if it had passed more time since BoD release, but it's been only 5 weeks. April 16th is reasonable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. 2 extra bosses isn't going to hurt.<br />
<br />
2. Blizzard admitted a while ago that LFR aka the more casual audience is what justifies raid development.<br />
<br />
There go Blizzard design raiding with primarily the casual audience in mind. There is no need to timegate two whole bosses.<br />
<br />
Now go find me a solid reason as to why what is basically half a Terrace of Endless Spring should be timegated.</div></div><hr />

Legion start vs. BFA so far: <br />
<br />
Legion 7.0 = EN BFA 8.0 = Uldir<br />
<br />
Legion 7.1 = TOV BFA 8.1 = BOD<br />
<br />
Legion 7.1.5 = NH BFA 8.1.5 = COS<br />
<br />
Legion 7.2 = TOS BFA 8.2 = Azshara......<br />
<br />
Still.... It feels like Legion gave us waaaaaaaay more... Maybe because of class campaigns, mage tower challenges.... 1 came with 7.0 and other with 7.2</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sageless</div><div class="date">2019-03-01, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soooo...<br />
<br />
They are making the same mistake as with High Maul and BlackRock Foundry. You can't release two raid instances in the same tier but delay one 10 weeks from the other. It means that the difficulty content that people are preferring to do (e.g. a heroic guild doing heroic) is already outgeared, since people already have 10 weeks of gear from the other instance in the same tier.<br />
<br />
So it is either too easy and people will clear it day 1, or it is too difficult and gear will not help since there are no upgrades on your difficulty left.<br />
<br />
It feels like a non-content content patch this way. And the only reasons to do the releases like this that I can think off are:<br />
<br />
1. Content development is lagging behind, which means there weren't enough resources to launch both raid instances.<br />
2. It is an artificial way to make it seem like content is being released and gives them more room to push 8.2 further back.<br />
<br />
While I dislike the sentiment it feels very much like WoW has a strategy to make a good expansion and then a poor expansion. Looking at the amount of systems/content implemented in Legion and comparing it to BFA and how much is iterations on what already was present in Legion it feels like the amount of hours put into the two expansions is miles apart. And for a game that requires a game purchase as well as a monthly subscription this feels very wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The class campaign would have been made up for across the two war campaigns and the extra leveling/zone content in bfa with there being 6 full story zones compared to legions 5 one of which was not clearly whole in 7.0.</div></div><hr />

By that logic, everything blizzard slaps a release date on is &quot;timegating&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Class campaign was done after first week, same with Suramar (with exception of last 2-3 chapters gated by rep). Mage Tower wasn't even a thing until 7.2 (and become more &quot;casual&quot; place after 7.3). Artifact was cool first 1-2 months, after that it was just paragon (later concordance).<br />
<br />
I think the answer is legendaries. People whined about them left and right, but they were exciting to get. For that people did emissary (so open world, but without pointless grinding), m+ and raids many times. BfA lacks this hook.<br />
<br />
I'm not telling that legos were perfect, of course it was pain in the ass for min-maxing people. Well, it's another proof that Blizz shouldn't listen to min-maxing crowd (like WoD wasn't enough).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And before you say &quot;No, it's 9 bosses for everybody!&quot; - just think about it for a second: If they made a 8.1.6 patch which read: &quot;We are now giving you the chance to visit NPC Mercynator to swap your faction on the two BFA continents! This allows you to play the quests of the opposite faction! Since this means we DOUBLED the release content of the game available to everybody, we will therefore delay the 8.2 patch by 2 months! Enjoy!&quot;<br />
<br />
...would you like that? because that is actually what they did....they created 6 bosses for each faction (3 of which are mirrored)...and since that was suckingly little, they just forced you to faction-change and play the other 3 bosses on a charatcer that is not your character.<br />
<br />
It is the same as forcing you to swap factions to play the quests of the other continent. But for some reason most players seem to not be bothered by it in the raid....open your eyes people. If you are fine with this bullshit inside a raid, it will happen in the world next.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kralljin</div><div class="date">2019-03-01, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering Crucible drops slightly higher Ilvl and has &quot;special loot&quot;, i guess they do not want to undermine BoD progression that early, or the design / tuning side is simply not ready.<br />

<br />
Your logic is faulty.<br />
For all intents and purposes, BoD has twelve bosses, three of which you never get to see depending on your faction.<br />
But since those three are identical, there is no gain / loss.<br />
<br />
You fight nine different bosses in BoD, meaning Blizzard created nine different fight, it's just different visuals on three fights depending on your faction.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since this means we DOUBLED the release content of the game available to everybody, we will therefore delay the 8.2 patch by 2 months! Enjoy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizzard has so far not argued once that the &quot;merc&quot; thing of BoD did seriously add more content or is a justification to delay content.<br />
It's a tool to give both factions the same experience, that is all.<br />
<br />
Your character gets transformed for three bosses, that's the whole gist of it, they just used the Merc tech instead of regular Illusion / transform auras.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And before you say &quot;No, it's 9 bosses for everybody!&quot; - just think about it for a second: If they made a 8.1.6 patch which read: &quot;We are now giving you the chance to visit NPC Mercynator to swap your faction on the two BFA continents!

I wouldn't even mind that, as it would save me the hassle of leveling an Alliance character to just get their side of the story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I do believe they need to add in Mage Tower 2.0, I guess they could do something with Transmogging to make it attractive. Sexy af weapon and armor sets maybe? I wouldn't complain if it was even HD remakes of T3 gear for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that’s not what timegating is, or every single patch and expansion and game by itself is time gated. <br />
<br />
Time gating is adding a piece of content that requires you to so something, like quests or farming, but you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can do the next step. Like you could do all warfront quests back to back, but they didn’t release the next quests for a few weeks, so even though you had time to play, you couldn’t. They time gated it. Same with farming. Back in the day you could farm certain things 24/7 if you wanted, finishing it in days. Now you often have a max per week, so there’s no way to farm more. That’s time gating.<br />

<br />
8.1.5 has an incredible amount for a .5 patch actually. The intention of them is to add small pieces of content, and we have plenty from it actually. WoW is dying much like you are, so be quite and sit down child.</div></div><hr />

Because Blizzard wants everybody to have a fair chance to complete the raid at their preferred difficulty before the next one releases.<br />

Why do you assume it's only about mythic raiders?</div></div><hr />

There go Blizzard design raiding with primarily the casual audience in mind. There is no need to timegate two whole bosses.<br />

With CoS coming out in April (only 3 months after BoD) there will be a lot of guilds still progressing that will have the option to go to CoS.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping in terms of boss difficulty its similar to SB/Jaina or even a bit tougher and the loot all shifts up 10 item levels (425 mythic, 410 heroic, etc.) along with a decent trinket or wep from the last boss.<br />
<br />
Also ToV suffered because EN was such a joke raid.</div></div><hr />

There's no logic to the crowd of usual Negative Nancies. They merely complain to complain.<br />

Its the same tier as the current raid.<br />

Its just a joke at this point. If this was any expansion before Legion the mini raid would have released along side the big raid. But blizzard is keen on making sure players have to wait a bit longer for what they used to get right away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rush? IMO 3 months is perfect pace between patches (that's why 8.1 was month too late, but on the other hand BfA launched month too soon). Remember that Crucible of Storms isn't 3rd &quot;tier&quot;, it's small 2 boss filler raid between Dazal'alor and Azshara. And most people expect 8.3 and N'zoth or Sylvanas raid as final 4th &quot;tier&quot; after that.<br />
<br />
So far I predict 8.2 in June, Azshara in July, Classic in August, 8.2.5 with Vulpera/Mechagnomes on September, 9.0 reveal on November, 8.3 on December, final raid in January, 8.3.5 with Worgen/Undead Allied Races in March, pre-order and Alpha in April, Beta on Summer, 9.0 launch on Fall 2020.<br />
<br />
By the way, if Classic will be moderate success, I wonder if they'll keep releasing expansion for that in odd years to help with sub count. They could just give option to stay on Classic server and copy character to TBC or they could do little more work and release new expansions without QoL changes. I guess all depends of Classic reception.</div></div><hr />

The way you are using timegating is the same as stating “why is the raid with Azshara timegated?” If that’s your reasoning, are you seriously asking why all raids aren’t just released at the start of the xpac? If you are, then sure, I can try and answer that. You just need to specify if that’s what you are asking.<br />
If you are asking why it’s waiting for its own patch, how about these reasons:<br />
1). It is the next chapter of the BfA story. It has nothing to do with the current raid.<br />
2). It’s a separate raid and part of a .5 patch in an attempt to keep content rolling out at a steady pace, something Blizz has stated they wanted to do.<br />
3). Blizzard decided to. Like it or not, it’s their game and they decide release dates.</div></div><hr />

1. So? Poor excuse to gate it by a month.<br />

<br />
1). Are you literally just arguing to argue? “Poor excuse to delay something that isn’t part of the story yet.” It’s literally not part of the current timeline and you’re saying it should be out already. Do yo like to read chapter 5 before you get to chapter 3?<br />
2). What evasion? It’s part of the patch and coming later. Kind of ties into the whole storytelling aspect of the game.<br />
3). Not agreeing with them is fine. Calling it crap is your opinion. <br />
It’s clear that the game genre is dying off. People have left the game in multitudes. Funny thing is, in terms of %s, the biggest drop offs in subs was from WotLK and Cata. Since then it’s just been steady. WoW is actually still going strong. Fun fact, WoW is in the top 3 earnings games for Acti-Blizz and Blizz has made more money than their projected income. Stands to reason WoW is doing pretty decently for what all the doomsayers are spouting.<br />
I get it, you’re not happy with the game at this point. One day I will probably be there too, but spouting your opinions like they are facts and having a valid arguement presented to you and your equivalent being what it is shows you just don’t want to have a conversation and would rather just spout off hate.</div></div><hr />

Another fun fact was that the peak of subs was also shortly after Cata was released (it released December 7th of 2010 but the 12.5 million active subs was February or so of 2011). However, after that point was when it started dropping, the biggest drop was actually afterwards down the road into MoP/WoD. WoD more so however.<br />
<br />
https://www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/<br />
<br />
^ This actually shows a projected decrease since 2015 to an estimated 2023 (while it may not be 100% accurate, the fact that it has a projected decrease and a formula are there shouldn't be discounted. It is decreasing, but not as badly as some people say it has (However with how criticized bfa is I wouldn't doubt more drops) and it has drastically dropped since Cata days sadly.</div></div><hr />

Back in burning crusade expansion all these raids (the eye, serpentshrine cavern, karazhan, gruul's lair, magtheridon's lair) were all available on DAY ONE and it was up to players to get attunement for the HYJAL raid. Meanwhile this crucible raid with only 2 bosses is the entire patch. Contents get smaller and less and less innovative. Sub drop in masses and you think blizzard is going to release new content sooner but they rather stretch it out as much as possible. <br />
<br />

<br />
Back in the day it took much longer for people to get gear and players didn’t devote the hours to the game back then. There was also a power progression required to move up while only providing 1 difficulty. This means multitudes of players won’t see content going back to this model.<br />
With LFR and no time released model, players will have every raid cleared inside of a few weeks to a month. Xpacs that last 1.5-2+ years would have content draughts bigger than WoD.<br />
As far as harder difficulties, top end guilds would clear these raids just as fast with split runs and high skill. <br />
People like Asmongold also hate on WoW because it’s the thing to do and gets more fans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And before you say &quot;No, it's 9 bosses for everybody!&quot; - just think about it for a second: If they made a 8.1.6 patch which read: &quot;We are now giving you the chance to visit NPC Mercynator to swap your faction on the two BFA continents! This allows you to play the quests of the opposite faction! Since this means we DOUBLED the release content of the game available to everybody, we will therefore delay the 8.2 patch by 2 months! Enjoy!&quot;<br />
<br />
...would you like that? because that is actually what they did....they created 6 bosses for each faction (3 of which are mirrored)...and since that was suckingly little, they just forced you to faction-change and play the other 3 bosses on a charatcer that is not your character.<br />
<br />
It is the same as forcing you to swap factions to play the quests of the other continent. But for some reason most players seem to not be bothered by it in the raid....open your eyes people. If you are fine with this bullshit inside a raid, it will happen in the world next.<br />

<br />
I told them in a &quot;subbmit suggestion&quot; that I want BC, WOtlK progression... every 11days you can choose a mythic raid level gear from a vendor (by doing stuff in the game) so there is a steady progression. And after that item upgrading by 5ilvl, socket, and other speed, leech, indus. bonuses. <br />
I don't understand why they don't let people to get fully geared before the new raid?????So maybe they can just enjoy the power of their work at least for a month.<br />
<br />
But they ignnored it, not even a thank you in my mail box... There are way more better games out there... Metro Exodus,Black Desert, I am replaying the half-life series right now.</div></div><hr />

ooh ooh...I am hoping RIFTS gets made. That will be one of the only games i'd leave WoW for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They needed 18 months to &quot;design&quot; upright trolls and fat humans and a few weeks/months of PTR to test unimaginative passives, and you believe you'll have Vulperas/Mechagnome in 6 months from now ? Damn.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abillioncats</div><div class="date">2019-03-04, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back in burning crusade expansion all these raids (the eye, serpentshrine cavern, karazhan, gruul's lair, magtheridon's lair) were all available on DAY ONE and it was up to players to get attunement for the HYJAL raid. Meanwhile this crucible raid with only 2 bosses is the entire patch. Contents get smaller and less and less innovative. Sub drop in masses and you think blizzard is going to release new content sooner but they rather stretch it out as much as possible. <br />
<br />
This is why people like Asmongold complain about WoW 24/7 because the game is at the worst possible state and it's worth complaining about.<br />
<br />
Nah, he complains all the time because that's what people expect him to do, that's how he gets his views. The game is arguably in a far worse state that it was in legion. But this mini-raid coming out in April instead of March is like the last thing I'd complain about. I'd much rather complain about the azerite gear, of course they're gonna be fixing that in 8.2 so I can understand why you might be desperate to find something else to complain about.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty suuuuuuuuuure most people still playing will be too busy leveling their new Zandalari or Kul Tirans to care frankly. And 8.2 is gonna probably come out in like what, May or June most likely?<br />

I read stuff like this a lot for some reason, its like people forget most of those raids released were so broken and bug riddled they couldn't even be beaten at the time, I can't see why anyone would something like that back.<br />
<br />
Exactly mate, you understand. Nobody actually wants that shit back LOL.<br />

<br />
Back in the day it took much longer for people to get gear and players didn’t devote the hours to the game back then. There was also a power progression required to move up while only providing 1 difficulty. This means multitudes of players won’t see content going back to this model.<br />
With LFR and no time released model, players will have every raid cleared inside of a few weeks to a month. Xpacs that last 1.5-2+ years would have content draughts bigger than WoD.<br />
As far as harder difficulties, top end guilds would clear these raids just as fast with split runs and high skill. <br />
People like Asmongold also hate on WoW because it’s the thing to do and gets more fans.<br />
<br />
Yeah well, people often forget the things that weren't convient about wow back then for the sake of pretending everything was perfect &quot;back in the day&quot;. It really wasn't.</div></div><hr />

Dunno where you got that I was being defensive from by replying to you but whatever I guess.<br />
<br />
Seems to me you are just throwing around random words at this point rather than actually debating the topic. So guess I'll do the same.</div></div><hr />
