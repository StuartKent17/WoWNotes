<br />
Ko'ragh was the only ogre to survive direct exposure to a mysterious relic unearthed by the Highmaul excavations of Nagrand, and was left with a near-complete immunity to all magic. Rumors abound regarding his connection to the Imperator, with some wondering why Ko'ragh would remain subservient to a sorcerer despite his unique gifts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overview - Ko'ragh is protected by a Nullification Barrier that absorbs all magic damage taken. When the barrier is removed, he activates a rune that recharges it. While recharging, one player may also absorb some of the rune's energy and receive a Nullification Barrier. As the fight progresses, an increasing amount of Overflowing Energy orbs spill from the rune and float to the ground, exploding when they land. Players who have a Nullification Barrier can catch and absorb Overflowing Energy to mitigate the amount of raid wide damage and prevent a lethal amount of damage from occurring. In Mythic difficulty, two players may enter the rune per phase of Charging.<br />
<br />

Avoid &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/161612-overflowing-energy&quot;&gt;Overflowing Energy&lt;/a&gt; until you have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/163134-nullification-barrier&quot;&gt;Nullification Barrier&lt;/a&gt;. Absorb &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/161612-overflowing-energy&quot;&gt;Overflowing Energy&lt;/a&gt; when you do have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/163134-nullification-barrier&quot;&gt;Nullification Barrier&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/healer.png&quot; title=&quot;Healer&quot; /&gt; Healers - Focus intense healing on players absorbing &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/161242-caustic-energy&quot;&gt;Caustic Energy&lt;/a&gt; to allow them to survive the transformation.<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/162185-expel-magic-fire&quot;&gt;Expel Magic: Fire&lt;/a&gt; inflicts heavy raid wide damage and requires dispels to mitigate some of the damage.<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/162184-expel-magic-shadow&quot;&gt;Expel Magic: Shadow&lt;/a&gt; absorbs all healing on the raid until it is removed.<br />

Volatile Anomalies will spawn periodically during the charging phase. If they are killed within a &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/161328-suppression-field&quot;&gt;Suppression Field&lt;/a&gt;, they will not cast &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/163466-destabilize&quot;&gt;Destabilize&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/dps.png&quot; title=&quot;Dps&quot; /&gt; Nullification Barrier (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/156803) - Ko'ragh is protected from all magic, absorbing up to 4,020,890 Magic damage.<br />
<br />
Breaker's Strength (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/162569) - While Ko'ragh maintains a Nullification Barrier, his damage done is increased by 8% every 10 seconds. This effect stacks. When the barrier expires, Breaker's Strength is removed.<br />
Charging (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/1538) - When the Ko'ragh's Nullification Barrier is removed, he begins to recharge. After 20 sec, the barrier is restored.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png&quot; title=&quot;Important&quot; /&gt; Caustic Energy (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/161242) - One player may enter the rune with Ko'ragh, absorbing a portion of its energy. The energy inflicts 32,152 Arcane damage every second and reduces all healing received by 5% for as long as the player remains inside of the rune. This effect pierces all immunities and damage reductions. When the rune powers down, the player receives their own Nullification Barrier, proportional to the amount of time spent inside the rune. The Nullification Barrier received by players can absorb up to 15,000,000 Magic damage. In Mythic difficulty, two players may enter the rune per phase of Charging. In Raid Finder difficulty, five players may enter the rune per phase of Charging.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suppression Field (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/161328) - Ko'ragh strikes the ground at a player's location, inflicting 57,200 Arcane damage in an 8 yard area. In addition, a field of suppressing energy is created that silences all players and inflicts 34,280 Arcane damage every second.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effect will also silence Volatile Anomalies.<br />
Volatile Anomalies - While the Rune of Nullification is active, 3 Volatile Anomalies spawn every 8 sec.<br />
<br />
Destabilize (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/163466) - Volatile Anomalies explode upon death, inflicting 28,575 Arcane damage to all players.<br />
<br />
Expel Magic - <br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/magic.png&quot; title=&quot;Magic&quot; /&gt; Expel Magic: Fire (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/162185) - Ko'ragh expels Fire magic inflicting 10,725 Fire damage every second for 10 sec. to all players. When Expel Magic: Fire expires, it inflicts 57,200 Fire damage to all allies within 5 yards.<br />
Expel Magic: Fel (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/172895) - Ko'ragh expels fel magic into 3 random players, marking them for 12 sec. When Expel Magic: Fel expires, it creates a line of fel energy between where the wearer gained this effect and where the effect expired. The fel energy persists for 1.5 min, and inflicts 95,000 Fire damage to all players within it.<br />
Expel Magic: Arcane (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/162186) - Ko'ragh blasts a player with corrupted Arcane energy that marks their current location every 0.5 sec. for 10 sec. After 1.5 sec., the marked location explodes, inflicting 143,000 Arcane damage to all players within 5 yards. In addition, this effect increases Physical damage taken by 100%.<br />
Expel Magic: Frost (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/172747) - Ko'ragh expels an orb of Frost that inflicts 64,350 Frost damage to all players. The orb persists for 20 sec and slows movement speed of all players within 30 yards by up to 85%. The snare effect of Expel Magic: Frost decreases as a player stands farther away from the expelled orb.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/healer.png&quot; title=&quot;Healer&quot; /&gt; Expel Magic: Shadow (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/162184) - Ko'ragh expels Shadow magic, inflicting all players with a heal absorption effect that prevents up to 50,000 healing received.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/deadly.png&quot; title=&quot;Deadly&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png&quot; title=&quot;Important&quot; /&gt; Overflowing Energy (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/161612) - Arcane energy bleeds from the rune stone, inflicting 150,000 Arcane damage to enemies it comes into contact with. If the energy reaches the ground, it explodes, inflicting 49,500 Arcane damage to all enemies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effect pierces all immunities and damage reductions.<br />
Dominating Power (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/163472) - Imperator Mar'gok uses the power of the rune stone to mind control all players that come into contact with Overflowing Energy. This effect grants immunity to all Magic and is removed when the player is brought below 20% health.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/interruptable.png&quot; title=&quot;Interruptable&quot; /&gt; Forfeit Power (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/163517) - Players mind controlled by Dominating Power attempt to forfeit 5% of their shield and give Ko'ragh 5% of his shield.<br />
<br />

Arthas Costume Hotfix<br />
So after looking into it there are a few hotfixes that will be going out early next week to address the Lich King costume. We won't be testing these fixes until Monday, so until they're applied and listed in the Hotfixes blog these are just current intentions. Assuming it all goes to the current plan: the cost is being adjusted down by half, we're ensuring it is indeed 50 charges (20min per charge), and that it's usable outside of the Hallow's End event period. Keep in mind that when the hotfixes go out the cost shown on the vendor won't change, but the item will indeed be purchasable for the hotfixed amount.<br />
<br />
Seems rather silly to price it in such a way you have to choose to either purchase that, or the pets and other things because of there only being about 650 candy thats physically possible to get.<br />
It's intentionally priced as being sort of the 1 item someone would want to go after if they really want to turn into the Lich King every once in a while. It won't be what everyone wants to chase after, and that's ok. However, pets are account-wide of course, and so you can get multiple items if you're participating in the event on multiple characters.<br />

Premade Groups Finder<br />
Subregions (like Oceanic) are separated within the Premade Groups tool. It's not a setting on your end, but one we define for the tool as a whole. If that's not working correctly we'd like to look into it.<br />

What category were you searching within and what groups were you joining? (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/345309-premade-groups-finder/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14927692652?page=1#4))<br />

When Rejuv is applied it lasts for 12 seconds, if you refresh it lasts for 16, is this intended?<br />
Yes this is intended. All player cast HoTs and DoTs work this way in warlords. It allows you to refresh in last 1/3 without a loss (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522487380985405440))<br />

Traps arm instantly now, but the travel time makes chaining CC mandatory again. Is this against your design?<br />
It isn't against our design. We still like that it's possible to avoid if you see it coming. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522419454786174976))<br />
would rather see a cast time added to trap launcher instead of travel time. This promotes chaining cc, which is against design goal<br />
Chaining CC is a part of WoW PvP. It's definitely part of the design. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522487014218665985))<br />

Character / Items<br />
Any chance of getting old Wrath pvp weapons on vendors? Currently only s8 is available<br />

<br />
PvP<br />
alternatively, was it due to poor player interest in them? would you say the attempt to relaunch them at 90 didn't work out?<br />
Both good questions. Wintergrasp and Tol Barad were great when they were current content. But interest in them is low. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522234932001648641))<br />
In order for them to be a good experience, we feel like a lot of work would need to go into them (server tech, design rework etc) (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522235164202520577))<br />
We feel that effort is better spent elsewhere, creating great new content for everyone. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522235237703499777))<br />
This conflicts with the revamped 1-60 experience back in cata. Maybe stick to a design philosophy instead of swaying?<br />
Disagree. I think reworking the level up experience almost everyone experiences is different from preserving events. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522387405978890240))<br />

Lore<br />
In the Gul'dan and Stranger comic, why is Gul'dan chained?<br />
He didn't know what was going to happen to him when he drank the blood. (Did you like the comic?) (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/522491776188170240))<br />
<br />
worgen fan here. Any news on the quest line in WoD where Tess looks into a disease the worgen are suffering from? Still in game?<br />
It was removed during a zone re-vamp. The story may come back later in some form. Tess is a cool character. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/522495106440392704))<br />

In the beta, Frostwall defenders are ugh... High elves ! Is it intended ? Otherwise, will it ever be corrected ?<br />
Not intentional. Let me get a bug in and try to fix for release. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/522498388890120192))<br />

Khadgar has always been my favorite character however now ye turned him into a traitor to the Alliance. Are you proud?<br />
Khadgar is one of my favorites, too! It's nice to bring him back to the spotlight, doing what it takes to save Azeroth (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/522499667771146241))<br />
<br />
Are Cloud Serpents Beasts or Dragonkin? Adult mobs are labeled beasts but some of the young are labeled dragonkin.<br />
We're inconsistent in-game, but they're not really related to the classic Azeroth dragonflights. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/522499869219373056))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolution, we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/ssdgraph.gif) are trending slightly downward over the past few months, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale. <br />
<br />
The GTX 980 and 970 have been released! The 970 is a good value, but it is almost always out of stock. <br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A). <br />
<br />

Originally we named them something like Low End, Mid, High, Ultra and people complained, so we went with more fun names that people don't complain about.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the Setup of the Month part, how good are the &quot;Puppy&quot; and &quot;Dolphin&quot; setups, in regards to running WoW? Will they at least run WoD on good? Or is it just better bang for the buck, to go for at least &quot;Narwhal&quot;?<br />
<br />
I wouldn't go below Narwhal. The 4690K is a significant improvement over the lower end CPUs. You can skimp and skip the SSD (don't do it!) and get the 600B PSU, as well as buy parts that are on sale to get closer to ~$800. For example, there is a R9 270X on sale right now for $142 after rebates, some ~$10-15 off $100 or so at various online retailers, the ASRock Z97 + 4690K are on sale for $280 if you wanted to skimp on the motherboard a bit.</div></div><hr />

With all of these other builds I would Choose a Gigabyte GTX 750ti instead of the amd choice.</div></div><hr />

At the other price points Nvidia doesn't have any good choices.<br />

You can buy any size, we just list some decent models.</div></div><hr />

I'll throw a plug - if you need help, hit reddit's Build-a-PC forum (http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc) for more ideas, and if you want direct help, try Reddit's BuldaPCforMe (http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme) section, where you can get direct help with chosing parts.</div></div><hr />

If it's supposed to the &quot;best&quot; then a minimum of 256 or 512GB is required. In addition, why continue to use Rosewill PSUs? Are you getting paid to post them? Corsair and Antec have much better and higher quality PSUs.<br />
<br />
Does anyone actually even research which parts are good before posting them? Because it doesn't seem so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does it mean 8gb (1866 mhz) is enough for gtx 970 on ultra @ 1080p resolution? (I run 2 wows often)<br />
<br />
Can I change case and psu 750W for:<br />
Case: Raidmax Vortex V4, 12cm Fan/ToolFree/USB 3.0/Anti Dust<br />
PSU: 700W Raidmax Cobra RX-700AC-B, 80PLUS Bronze/PFC/12cmFan/Andyson or even 600W Raidmax Cobra RX-600AF-B, 80PLUS Bronze/PFC/12cmFan/Andyson (gtx 970 doesnt require much power and I will use Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO instead of Noctua heatsink and probably I will add +8gb memory in future)</div></div><hr />

I prefer headsets over headphones + mic unless you are spending a lot, which is something people love to debate / complain about, so I don't list them to avoid complaints.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4690k vs. Regular 4690 for WoD mythic raiding. My geek friends tell me what the 4690 is sufficient since I would not over clock the CPU. Would it matter?<br />
<br />
Also, I'm intrigued by the new ITX cases - what's your opinion on an ITX case with an Asus Maximus VI Impact motherboard? M-VII Impact is really expensive in my country (double that of the VI)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Thanks!<br />
If you plan on keeping it for a few years and aren't going the ITX route, grab the K version so that you can overclock later when requirements go up in the next expansion. WoW will take all of the CPU it can get still, so it isn't a bad idea to overclock now. <br />
<br />
I'm not a fan of the ITX form factor in general, I have an Air 540 with plenty of desk space to keep things cool and overclocked. I don't follow ITX boards closely, but other than the audio quality issues people have mentioned it looks okay.<br />
<br />

<br />
The G600 had some quality issues of its own back when it first came out, I haven't checked up on it recently though. I'll be sure to take a look.</div></div><hr />

Which of these tiers would get the job done without absolutely killing the bank account? Would it be worth waiting until the next computer set-up of he month?<br />
<br />
Note: WoW is the only graphically intense game that I plan on playing; I don't need anything that would just be overkill for WoW. <br />
