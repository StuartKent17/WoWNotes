<br />
The Scroll of Resurrection is currently on cooldown, but will be resurrected soon. Once it’s available, you will be able to earn a free faction mount when you use a Scroll of Resurrection to bring a friend or former guildmate back to World of Warcraft, but this offer will only be available for a limited time. Any active World of Warcraft non-trial player can send a Scroll of Resurrection. To be eligible to receive a Scroll of Resurrection, your friend must have previously purchased at least one month of game time at any point in the past, and your friend’s account must have been inactive since March 4, 2012 or earlier.<br />
<br />
Once your friend accepts your scroll and pays for at least 30 days of game, you unlock your choice of the following rewards:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A Free Spectral Gryphon for an Alliance character<br />
Or a Free Spectral Wind Rider for a Horde character<br />
<br />
<br />
And, to enable you and your friend to play together in Cataclysm’s newest content, any friend who accepts your Scroll will also receive the following epic benefits:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A single character immediately boosted all the way to level 80 -- DING!<br />
A FREE upgrade to Cataclysm -- regardless of your friend’s original box level<br />
An optional FREE character move -- to your realm and faction so you can play together<br />
7 FREE days of game time -- available immediately<br />
<br />
<br />
A few other prerequisites apply -- such as a free upgrade to a Battle.net account for players who haven’t played since 2009 or earlier -- so be sure to check out the FAQ below for full eligibility details.<br />
<br />
We’ll provide an update once the Scroll of Resurrection is ready to be cast on your friends. Keep an eye on the World of Warcraft official Community site for more information.<br />
<br />
Scroll of Resurrection FAQ<br />
<br />
Basics<br />
<br />
How do I send a Scroll of Resurrection to my friend?<br />
<br />
There are two options for sending Scrolls of Resurrection:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While in-game, open your Real ID friends list or guild roster; any characters or accounts that are eligible to receive a Scroll of Resurrection will have a special button next to them. Click that Scroll of Resurrection button to generate the email invitation. You’ll also have the option to include a personal message to your friend inviting them back to the game.<br />
From your Battle.net Account Management page, click on the World of Warcraft account that you would like to send the invitation from and select Referrals Rewards- Scroll of Resurrection will be an option in that menu. Once clicked, you can enter the name and e-mail address of the friend you’d like to resurrect and include a personal message along with your invitation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eligibility &amp; Limitations<br />
<br />
Who can be sent a Scroll of Resurrection?<br />
To be eligible to receive a Scroll of Resurrection, your friend must have previously subscribed to World of Warcraft for at least 30 days and their account must have become inactive on or before March 4th,2012.<br />
<br />
If your friend’s World of Warcraft account has been inactive since December 2009 (or longer), your friend must first associate their World of Warcraft account with a free Battle.net account before they can receive a Scroll of Resurrection. Tell your friend to see our Battle.net Account FAQ for information on creating a Battle.net account and merging their WoW account. After your friend has set up their account, you should be able to send them a Scroll of Resurrection normally.<br />
<br />
Can I resurrect one of my own World of Warcraft accounts?<br />
If you have at least one active World of Warcraft account, you can send your inactive accounts Scroll of Resurrection invitations.<br />
<br />
How long is the Scroll of Resurrection invitation good for once I send it out?<br />
Your friend has 30 days to accept the invitation. The offer will expire if not used within that time.<br />
<br />
Is there a limit on the number of Scroll of Resurrection invitations that I can send out?<br />
There is a limit of one Scroll of Resurrection invitation per day per World of Warcraft Account on both the web and in-game. This makes an effective limit of 2 Scroll of Resurrection invitations per day per account if you use both sending options. There is no limit on the number of lifetime Scroll of Resurrection invitations that an account can send.<br />
<br />
Can I invite someone who has never played before with a Scroll of Resurrection?<br />
Scroll of Resurrection can only be used on players who once had active World of Warcraft subscriptions. For a similar offer for friends who have never subscribed to World of Warcraft, please see the Recruit-A-Friend FAQ.<br />
<br />
Sending the Scroll of Resurrection<br />
<br />
What benefits are there to sending a Scroll of Resurrection?<br />
You will receive an exclusive mount when your friend who accepted the Scroll first renews their subscription and pays for 30 days of game time – the Spectral Gryphon for Alliance characters or the Spectral Wind Rider for Horde characters.<br />
<br />
How do I redeem my mount once my friend subscribes?<br />
Visit your Account Management page and click on the Scroll of Resurrection option. Under the History/Status tab, you will see Claim Mount button when you are able to redeem the mount. Choose the realm and character on which you want to receive the mount and it will arrive in your character’s mailbox.<br />
<br />
Note: The mount can only be redeemed on one character per Scroll.<br />
<br />
When do I receive my mount for resurrecting a friend?<br />
Your friend must accept your Scroll of Resurrection invitation and renew their subscription for you to qualify for the mount. In order to qualify for the mount, your friend must renew their subscription after accepting the Scroll, and pay for at least 30 days of game time.<br />
<br />
Can I earn multiple mounts on my account?<br />
Yes! This reward will be given to you for each friend who accepts your invitation and meets the re-subscription criteria.<br />
<br />
Can I track the invitations I send out?<br />
After your friend accepts, you will be able to view the status of the invitation on the History page in the Referrals &amp; Rewards section of your Battle.net Account Management page.<br />
Who will receive the sender reward when several people send the same person Scrolls of Resurrection?<br />
<br />
Who will receive the sender reward when several people send the same person Scrolls of Resurrection?<br />
Only the player whose invitation is accepted will receive the sender’s reward. If the recipient gets several invitations, it will be up to them to choose which to accept. A recipient can accept a maximum of one Scroll of Resurrection per eligible World of Warcraft account.<br />
<br />
Accepting the Scroll of Resurrection<br />
<br />
What benefits are there for accepting a Scroll of Resurrection invitation?<br />
The Scroll’s recipient immediately receives a FREE digital upgrade all the way to World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. Additionally, the Scroll’s receiver can permanently boost one character to level 80 so that they can jump straight into the adventure for their 7 days of FREE game time!<br />
<br />
Note: The digital upgrade and level boost will only be available for scrolls sent during the 90-day promotion period. Players who accept a Scroll of Resurrection that was sent after the promotion period ends will still receive 7 days of FREE game time, but will not be eligible for the digital upgrade or level boost.<br />
<br />
I just accepted a Scroll of Resurrection. How do I level boost my character?<br />
Log in to your Battle.net Account and click on the resurrected license. Once you’re on the Game Management page, click Claim Rewards and select the character to level along with their spec. The next time you log in, they’ll be ready to adventure in a sundered Azeroth!<br />
<br />
How does the boost to level 80 work for the Scroll’s recipient?<br />
After accepting the Scroll, the recipient can choose one character to boost to level 80. The character’s spec will be chosen by the recipient prior to completing the level boost and the character will also be given appropriate talents under the chosen spec. The character will be placed in his or her faction’s capital city and will be ready to adventure immediately. This means that the character will be granted all class skills and spells up to level 80, a flying mount and riding skill, and a green quality set of level- and spec-appropriate gear for leveling.<br />
<br />
Any gear that was on the character prior to the level boost will be mailed back to the character via in game mail.<br />
<br />
Hunter pets will not be given a spec, so level boosted Hunters will need to spec out their pets normally after logging in for the first time.<br />
<br />
Note: Active quests may be abandoned when a level boost is performed. If a quest is abandoned in this way, you will be able to pick it up normally from the NPC who originally gave you the quest.<br />
<br />
Can I only level boost one character? What happens if my main character is on a different realm or faction than the friend who invited me?<br />
If the character that was level boosted is on a different realm or faction than the character who sent the invitation, you will be eligible for a free Character Transfer and/or a free Faction Change to bring you to your friend’s realm and faction.<br />
<br />
Note: Existing limitations apply for Faction Changes and Realm Transfers under the Scroll of Resurrection system. Please see the Faction Change and Realm Transfer FAQs for details. In addition, players on an RU server will not receive a free Realm Transfer if the friend who invited them is from an EU server.<br />
<br />
How many times can one person accept a Scroll of Resurrection?<br />
After March 5th, 2012, accounts are only able to accept one Scroll of Resurrection per eligible World of Warcraft account– if your friend has already accepted an invitation after March 5th, they will not be able to accept another for the same World of Warcraft account, but may accept invitations for other eligible World of Warcraft accounts.<br />
<br />
Is there a way for me to boost a character to 80 without a Scroll of Resurrection?<br />
The ability to boost a character to 80 only comes when you accept a Scroll of Resurrection invitation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, it's a boost to 80 which seems like if you don't have a L1 (at least) of a character, you can't do it.<br />
<br />
I'll end up boosting a Shaman or Rogue that's been hanging out in the 20's forever.<br />
<br />
What this basically means, is that the next expansion is going to be in Beta in about a month so you should stop being so serious about what's going on right now and just learn to have fun with a video game. * (I mean they've been trying to get people to stop being uptight entitled kids for a while but the message sure ain't sinking in)</div></div><hr />

1 - wait until April 1st<br />
2- Activate it.<br />

Why? Because that way you will NOT register as a part of Q1 and thus not be a tool to help blizztivision pretend their game is doing better than it is. You get your char for 15 bucks, and if you quit your sub right away, it will still end in time for you to not be part of Q2 either ^^</div></div><hr />

What is so bad about helping out Blizzard? You play their game, yet you refuse to help Blizzard? Blizzard needs everything they can get to make their investors happy or they will be crushed.</div></div><hr />

There simply trying to make more money, er, there a business...it's no secrete to anyone but the most die-hard fanboys that Blizzard isnt making as much.<br />

Every single Scroll of Resurrection thread so far has had a few posts from you making inflamatory comments intent only on stirring people up. For someone who hates a game so much you're giving it an awful lot of attention.</div></div><hr />

You play their game, yet you refuse to help Blizzard? Blizzard needs everything they can get to make their investors happy or they will be crushed.<br />
Blizzard could do so by making adequate expansion, not semi-expansion. Cool sub numbers can come not only from complex promotions but also from content.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which - &quot;instant level 80&quot; skips all interesting content.<br />
<br />
Why I had no doubts that new mounts would have to do something with convoluted microtransactions, they could as well come from some new original 5-men, which Cata hadn't after release, or from new questlines/zone, which could finally have replayability as currently all Cata zones are barely replayable, or at least as true veterans' recognition for having long-time subcription in UO style. But I guess making content is hard way and brings less USD than easy microtransaction way.</div></div><hr />

1. My wife unsubbed a few months ago and likes this idea of getting an instant 80. *She already has an 85 druid, and a 55 mage. *But she really would prefer to play a hunter next , but doesn't have one created on the account. *Is she going to be able to create a level 1 hunter and boost it to 80 if she gets a scroll of rez from me?<br />
<br />
2. She accepted one scroll of rez from me in the past. *And I believe in the past it wouldn't let an account do this again. *But the q/a kinda seems like it will. *Has anyone seen a clarified answer to this?<br />

they have always screwed over the vet players. From guildies who played since release never getting beta invites to achievements being gained by non-vets, there has always been little to no recognition given to loyal customers.<br />
<br />
What sickens me the most is that they have pushed Diablo 3 back yet again, despite it being completely done (what exactly has their justification been for the last 2 delays?), just to milk subscribers another few months. The quarter after D3 comes out there will be 2mil+ subs lost. Bank on it, I know the shareholders will be.</div></div><hr />

Because the game caters to the ultra-casual now, and there's little else that ultra-casual players love more then leveling alt after alt after alt. *Getting 10 max level alts on every server is the new Scarab Lord.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but the scroll of ressurection feature wont be live, the only clue say 'soon'*<br />

If I invite my second, inactive account, and then make a char that I'm gonna boost to 80 on a server thats different to the one I've got my mains on, will the free realm transfer also let me transfer it over accounts?<br />

Because if thats the case, hooooo mama thats awesome.<br />

Well that was interesting - A few points for people who care -<br />
<br />
- You can make a new character for this, just make sure to log out and back into the site.<br />
- The transfer is realm only, and does not affect account. If you want to change account, I advise not using the free transfer so you don't have the 3 day cooldown.<br />
- You have to wait until the 7 free days are expired before a sub is billed, which is when you get the mount. The alternative is to use a 60 day prepaid card.<br />
- You do indeed start with the 232 gear that was datamined a few patches ago, you also start with food, 280% flying, and a prepicked spec. You choose your spec on the site when claiming the reward.<br />
<br />
- Leveling at 80 in dungeons is going to suck because noone is going to have a clue how to play their classes. This is going to be fun lol.</div></div><hr />

Getting a boost from Level 1 to 80 with Neophyte gear on it absolutely win. I had a buddy boost his DK to 80 from 60 using RAF awards. I do believe he spent the majority of his time trying to obtain gear from Wrath mobs so he could at least try to kill things in Cata content. They don't bump your gear but they do screw you in the gear department. He was turboing the DK on a new server so he had like no gold, too. It was complete win. How about something for those of us that cancel after March 4, 2012. I started playing Rift again and have no desire to come back. Maybe a shiny mount for me? Of course I would probably cancel again, I am that kind of person.</div></div><hr />

I got mine instantly. I'm guessing what's happening for you is your subscription hasn't actually been charged yet because it still has game time and the system only charges it when you're about to run out. What i did was went to www.blizzard.com and purchased a 30 day code from their store and had my friend put it on his account and i was instantly able to claim my mount.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I think blizzard usually charges people when they have like 3 days left so in 4 days you'll get it.</div></div><hr />

Not necessarily, the way I see it, it is a form of innovation that will be beneficial to WoW, and will be seen to be replicated by other MMOs in near future upon doing so.<br />

<br />
I have to agree with this, instant 80 for someone that may or may not stay? And the deal is? Did they just give them a free 85 geared in heroic DS gear? No. It's a level 80, in greens, with a bit of stuff too it not the end of the world, and nothing a smart player would quit over. The only people who would quit, are the ones that need some form of justification to quit, anything would work ... like this benefit to bringing back old players. -.o</div></div><hr />

Yes, the free transfer is only for the character you boosted to 80. :o</div></div><hr />

...not within this year or the next? It is foolish to think this leads down the F2P path. Why on earth would Blizzard make WoW F2P?</div></div><hr />

I don't see a problem with it at all. Its something free for loving friends of mine, and it could help them with more players to come. The only issue at the moment is logging into the game,lol.

<br />
I agree with this. I don't think I can explain it logically, but I just feel a little... jipped. I've been leveling alts lately and I can't manage to level a warlock, though I've wanted to forever and tried a billion times. One I got to 20 before deleting, next try got me to 64, deleted it for space, next try got me to 38, sprinkle in about 20 attempts I forgot and level 20-50 warlocks on other servers that I never had to delete. If I could zip one to 80, that would be awesome. I've been playing and paying for six years straight... and then my friend who pretty much hates WoW but realized that SWToR sucks worse, got SoR'd by one of our mutual friends, and gets his free level 80 character while I'm still trying to level mine after not ever stopping my subscription. :/ Idk, just feels lame. I know they just want people to play again and whatever. I guess I'm totally just jelly.</div></div><hr />

Anyone that comes back will realize that the reasons they quit still exist, and probably won't stick around too long.

Tip for people who have quit, and who are considering this just for the &quot;free&quot; 80.<br />
<br />
1 - wait until April 1st<br />
2- Activate it.<br />
<br />
Why? Because that way you will NOT register as a part of Q1 and thus not be a tool to help blizztivision pretend their game is doing better than it is. You get your char for 15 bucks, and if you quit your sub right away, it will still end in time for you to not be part of Q2 either ^^<br />

Oh and those on dead servers, the content presented to you is all you deserve if you are not willing to Xfer then i doubt you have the dedication to be part of a hardcore guild anyways.<br />
It seems pretty harsh to penalize players for not xferring on a server that died when they have no control whatsoever in causing the server to die. Not everyone can afford to xfer out of a server, especially if they have multiple toons needing to be moved. Not to mention that WoW is particularly expensive when it comes to character transfers. A different mmo I used to play only costs $15 + $5per extra toon. WoW costs, what, $25 per toon?<br />
<br />
If nothing else, the free xfer is only eligible for the toon that got boosted to 80 which means you can't xfer your 'main' toon, and any other alts. In other words, players can't really rely on this system alone to get out of a dead server, unless they're willing to abandon all other toons.</div></div><hr />

I don't know but the only ones being desperate over here are the usual WoW bashers that daily trash talk the only mmorpg worth playing over the last 7 years for more than a few weeks...<br />
<br />
Go play the duds instead. <br />
<br />
It is sound business to promote your products and it is a 20.000.000 million ex-market they address (even more). I too would be worried if I were that Blizzard hater on daily forum posts.<br />
<br />
Just 10 weeks of witnessing the latest &quot;wow killer&quot; in action, this promotion couldn't come better to restart the original again.<br />
<br />
Watch the upcoming weeks with a hyped MoP, Diablo 3 to earn you money and I bet you there is even more Blizzard promotions upcoming.<br />
<br />
I can only wonder what the ceiling for WoW will be if the RMAH will be included in Wow in the coming years...<br />
<br />
30.000.000 players ?</div></div><hr />

Yeah why on earth would they when they are the only game on the market that successfully combines the F2P payment method with a subscription fee and not only have their customers accept it but defend it at the same time.</div></div><hr />

Simple answer: our reward is a FREE copy of Diablo 3 , a flying mount in game and free access to the next Wow expansion in beta coming in the next few weeks...<br />
<br />
That's around 80 Euros of cash without doing anything as an active Wow player ...</div></div><hr />

Can you be more specific? Never heard of any special law forbidding or allowing to send scroll of resurrection. Btw, same crap they did with Diablo III. But they have no problem to sell in any country shiny dragon mounts for real money.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that's not rewarding log term customers in any way, the &quot;free&quot; D3 isn't free in any way shape or form, especially considering that the WoW players actually payed the risk capital to make the damn game, a mount for getting some one to come back and re-sub to the game isn't free or a reward for being a long term customer either, at best it's a reward for getting new business, and finally, calling beta access that is bundled with a 145€ commitment a reward, testing a game for free, really?</div></div><hr />

I mean, how does Blizzard decide what talents are adequate in a given spec? Isn't it nigh impossible to go wrong with them anyway? What's more, with the free character boost, I assume that they'll be receiving some sort free level 80 gear - otherwise they'd be in a bad spot to jump into Cata stuff. I don't know, if I was the recipient of one of these scrolls, having Blizzard do everything for me would definitely make me feel like an idiot :p</div></div><hr />

THEY DID. Didn't they give the LOYAL PEOPLE D3 for FREE an ingame mount and 100% access to the MoP Beta ?????<br />

There is a difference between loyal in the future and loyal in the past. Is that difficult to grasp? I didn't get anything for being subbed 7 years, I got something for being subbed FOR ANOTHER YEAR (you seem to love capitals). Even new players can still get this, so it's in no way rewarding loyalty.</div></div><hr />

Free = no monetary cost, what you are talking about is the annual pass that will cost you 12 months x 12€ = 144€, for that amount you could just buy D3 and subscribe to WoW for 6 months and still be ahead.<br />
<br />
Edit: A nice gesture to the people that have been subscribing for the better part of a decade, allowing them to make new games without begging investors for risk capital and so on would have been a discount on D3 or any other game they made, a special mount once you subscribed for more than 24 months, stuff like that.</div></div><hr />
