Legion - Invasion Event<br />
There are some pieces of the pre-expansion invasion event currently in the Alpha, but they are very much incomplete. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Legion will invade several different zones of Azeroth. Right now they can be found in Tanaris, Hillsbrad, and the Wetlands.<br />
Right now there are small invasions, larger invasions, and named NPCs marked on the map when you are in each of those zones. <br />
There are a few quests that seem to be related, piloting a vehicle to kill Legion invaders, as well as timed kills. <br />
Several of the invasion sites have a chest you can open. Currently the chest only contains a placeholder, Timeless Isle items.<br />
There are also buffs you can pick up at some of the invasion sites, such as Felrune Barrier (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/185783-felrune-barrier).<br />
There are several scenarios that may be related to the event invasion point. <br />

Class Halls<br />
Why should we camp _pandarian_ starting zone insead of gorgeous M.of Shado-Pan/White Tiger or Peak of Serenity? How on Earth can someone's _racial_ zone be a part of &quot;class fantazy&quot;? Comparing to other CHs we got a joke<br />
It seems to be worse than garrisons, and being forced o start everyday there sounds terrible and boring like hell.<br />
Dalaran maintains portals to and from the class halls to keep you in the action! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/672949323638771712))<br />
<br />
The worse - you are making a strong racial point here, by appointing W.I. as our CH. It's saying monks = pandas.<br />
I'm sorry you don't like WI, lots of us were excited to feature beautiful place that all races of monks can now enjoy. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/672949872627089408))<br />

Is&quot;Tirisgarde&quot; (mentioned in the mage artifact quests) a synonym of the Order of Tirisfal/Tirisfalen?<br />
New group, dedicated to fighting Legion here and now! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/672948270805585921))<br />

I know amigo, I'm just razzing you. Thanks for posting the vid.<br />

It's because Wandering Isle should be a neutral racial capital for Pandaren, not monk central. Especially when every other race trains to be a Monk at the Peak of Serenity and even Pandaren head there to further their training.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeaaaaaah, but shut up though. It was literally the best we could've gotten. <br />
<br />
1. Pandaren are deeply entrenched in the lore of the playable Monk. Scarlet and Auchindoun monks are widely different in philosophy and motif to the class that values meditation, brews and chi.<br />
<br />
2. It's not only the to hang for your class, it's your class order's HQ in their campaign against the Legion. The Turtle is far more mobile and closer to the action for this purpose than let's say, the Shado Pan Monastery. (Peak of Serenity get's rekt.)<br />
<br />
3. IT'S A GIANT SEA TURTLE WITH A CULTURE HITCH-RIDING ON TOP OF IT.</div></div><hr />

The world's ending, dude. Pandarian land is already breached by the Burning Legion in the Monk Artifact and Class Hall quests. Shen-zin Su making allowances for new 'grand-children' to come on board him to defend the world isn't that scandalous, really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole point was to take that panda (forgot his name right now) around the world on adventures and as the turtle grew more and more pandas wanted to join him and live in peace on his back.<br />
<br />
If anything it's a peaceful, neutral and beautiful place to learn how to be a monk. Why does everyone want that Peak of Serenity place when as a monk you have to go there constantly? I'd want somewhere different.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to. Obviously we don't know if it ends up being another Garrison campaign type of farce, but my point is the reasoning for placing the Monk hall onto the turtle makes worlds more sense than you give it credit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhhhhh yeah? All the other races are taught the Pandaren Monk tradition. So their knowledge is the same as the Pandaren. Are you serious? And how the fuck would being at the Peak or Shado-Pan Monastery be different? Yes, the Peak has non-Pandaren Monk teachers, but it looks like the WI does too. <br />

<br />
MU Garona's in Twilight Highlands. She's a quest giver (for horde, if I recall). So she hasn't been MIA for decades. She's been in the game for a while. Guess many don't finish Twilight Highlands. AU Garona hasn't killed any kings as far as we know so AU Garona wouldn't be a kingslayer unless she's killed some orc chieftain we're unaware of. So the Garona in the rogue class hall has to be the MU one. If you also read the assassination rogue daggers description while Chaud's picking his weapons, that further suggests it's the MU Garona. AU Garona also wouldn't know who anyone at the table even is while MU Garona would. Blizzard should really clarify which she is, though, to avoid confusion. WoD really screwed people up when it comes to who's who. Perhaps a dialogue to ask her what she was doing while we were on Draenor? If she answers that she was on Draenor helping us, then it's the AU Garona. If she says anything else, it's the MU one. A 5 minute solution with most of that 5 minutes being thinking of and writing the dialogue!<br />
<br />
Still not impressed with the rogue class hall. Khadgar's inquiry was amusing, but somehow I doubt he's clueless to what the rogues are up to. If he really suspected them doing something he didn't like, he'd likely seal them into the sewer with an arcane wall or something ... or teleport them into the middle of the ocean to drown. So more than likely his inquiry was just for humor. Guy can't be that clueless. Be curious if he continues his inquiry later on in the questing experience, though. You'd also think he'd be antsy about having kingslayers in his sewer. AU Garona tried to kill him several times due to Gul'dan and yet Khadgar's not the slightest bit concerned Gul'dan may try to take over MU Garona and have her try to kill him?<br />
<br />
Surprised Blizzard would not use the Peak of Serenity, but guess it makes sense they'd move it to the turtle. If you have a mobile fortress, may as well use it. If Acherus and Dalaran are on the Broken Isles map, though, you'd think the Wandering Isle would be, too.<br />
<br />
When you think about the class halls, it makes sense for Blizzard to use new areas to save them from having to phase the area to keep out lower levels. With other areas like Acherus, duplicating a small zone like that and moving it somewhere new also saves them from having to do phasing to avoid lower levels. All of the reused areas are all duplications and tweaks of small areas (Wandering Isles, Acherus, Dalaran). Light's Hope is the only curious case I can think of since that's in a low level zone. Shaman class hall may be in the Maelstrom, but beside the intro quest to Deepholm, you never go back. Dragon Soul doesn't count. What's funny is that people whine when Blizzard reuses old content, but then when they don't do it, people still whine. People are whining Blizzard is reusing Acherus but then others are whining that Blizzard isn't reusing Ravenholdt or Peak of Serenity. Goes to show Blizzard can't please anyone.<br />
<br />
*FYI, I'd rather rogues have Ravenholdt. Giving them a sewer which has to smell like mildew and mold among other things makes me glad the game doesn't have a smell ability because rogues would be screwed. Stealth wouldn't save them if you can smell rotting fish, etc before they're 20 yds from you. I only have a rogue alt, but the sewer is just plain stupid. I can go either way on Peak of Serenity. Never cared much for my monk so not attached to the location and can't say I care much about the Wandering Isle, either.</div></div><hr />

Why the stupid conclusion that anyone who disagrees with a narrow viewpoint must be a blizzard fanboy or white knight when such an accusation must take into account the entire viewpoints of that individual which you have no intention of looking at.<br />
Stop acting like an idiot, throwing out a buzzword for the sake of it when you have no idea what it actually means.<br />
If you cant come up with a good argument, sling some mud to try and discredit the person instead of their point of view.<br />

At least they got a pretty island. Rogues got sewers. Yay. More and more, I think Kosak is a stubborn #@!@ who's making bad choices for the game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellrod</div><div class="date">2015-12-08, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wandering Isle is a fine place for the monk and all of that person's arguments are pretty weak. I'll go through a few of them right now, even:<br />
<br />
But it's not _just_ Dalaran. As monk, I won't get any CH at all, just copypasted WI with 0 new features.<br />
<br />
Wandering Isle is rarely seen or accessed save for a few level 1 Pandaren characters. the CH IS the feature, and it's just a hub where you can go to other places in the world, what more do you want? If this was anywhere else, you'd probably complain that it was still copy/pasted and no effort was put in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why should we camp _pandarian_ starting zone insead of gorgeous M.of Shado-Pan/White Tiger or Peak of Serenity? How on Earth can someone's _racial_ zone be a part of &quot;class fantazy&quot;? Comparing to other CHs we got a joke<br />
It seems to be worse than garrisons, and being forced o start everyday there sounds terrible and boring like hell.<br />
Just like I brought up earlier, they're saying that Wandering Isle is a cheap copy/paste, while Peak of Serenity, the zone that is still accessible after leaving, and visited 100x more often, somehow isn't? As far as the second argument goes, DKs got Acherus, a crucial part of the starting zone, yet no one complains. Monks were created by Pandaren so where else would be better than in a Pandaren area? All of our monk trainers came from there, as well as the H/A Pandaren factions we're familiar with. They're assuming it's just WI, when the game is still in Alpha. Also, on paper, CH are no where near as bad as Garrisons. Yeah, you start the day there, keyword: START the day. The CH is designed specifically to send you out into the field. No daily chores, no sitting in it because you don't need to leave.<br />
<br />
<br />
The worse - you are making a strong racial point here, by appointing W.I. as our CH. It's saying monks = pandas.<br />
I've seen this argument twice on the page, it's a fallacy. Just as someone else said, the Warrior CH is essentially in Vrykul Heaven, so by this logic, I can say that warriors = Vrykul, right? That they're the only real warriors? As said before, Monks originated with Pandas, they are Pandaren culture, so what better place for a monk class hall than in Pandaren lands? Let alone the land that is the birthplace of almost all the Pandaren characters we know the most, including Li Li and Chen Stormstout?<br />
<br />
They also complain that The Monk doesn't get a CH anywhere near as good as all the other classes. While some classes have more unique CHs than the others (e.g The Warlock CH being a Legion world filled with demons who make you their new king after long questline), most are about the same level as Monks. Demon Hunters also = their starting zone, Death Knights = Acherus, Mages = Abandoned Tirisfal Council HQ, Rogues = Sewers, Druids = a Grove, hunters = a Lodge, etc. They all seem to be on equal footing with eachother and what you deem as better or worse is entirely subjective.</div></div><hr />

Cool, you were only about a few months behind everyone who called it the instant Legion was announced as the expansion. Also, everything in this pre-expansion thing is basically the stuff we normally get plus some new stuff like the large scenario.<br />
<br />
Anyways I just came here to be like &quot;fuck yeah, Overwatch is sticking to the plan of not charging for new maps and characters. Go Blizz.&quot; and to complain that I am not in the Overwatch Beta and that it is on pause until mid January. First world middle class problems.</div></div><hr />

The game hasn't released yet and already Blizzard is taking in the feedback and making both necessary and not so necessary changes. They also aren't holding their customers hostage with the prospect of future DLC (although I'm sure it will rear its head in some form), but core components like heroes and maps will be free. League of Legends has done very well with how they've managed their free content vs paid content options. I also like the overall presence of the developer that's speaking. Soft spoken, mind temperament, dedicated to his craft but not some polished marketing a-hole whose sole purpose is to intimidate and fill his audience with false hope about a product that will never live up to expectations.<br />
