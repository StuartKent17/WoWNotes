Worgen Racial Mounts Clarification 
The intention with the new mounts was just to honor player concerns about achievements and even up the mount totals between the alliance and the horde. It’s something people had been requesting since the release of Cataclysm, so we’re evening up the numbers by giving the Alliance some additional mounts to add to their totals.

Worgen Racial Mounts Clarification<br />
The intention with the new mounts was just to honor player concerns about achievements and even up the mount totals between the alliance and the horde. It’s something people had been requesting since the release of Cataclysm, so we’re evening up the numbers by giving the Alliance some additional mounts to add to their totals.<br />
<br />
The Worgen racial mount is Running Wild. These are just some extra horses, for your horse needs. Perhaps the blog should have been titled 'New Gilnean Faction Mount'? Or maybe just 'Wyld Stallyns'? We may actually edit the blog to clarify why these mounts were added. To be clear, it’s not because we think worgen look their awesomest riding horses.<br />
<br />
The intention wasn't really to hype this up, so much as to simply inform and reduce confusion. Our thought was, rather than let these be introduced without any context via data-mining, that it seemed like a better idea to introduce them ourselves with a bit of context.<br />
<br />
[...] There was some miscommunication regarding the initial reason why these mounts were added. After talking with the devs again these mounts are actually being added because they already happened to be available and we thought it’d be nice to make them able to be purchased and ridden. Which is unfortunately quite a bit different than how we understood and framed the blog.<br />
<br />
Their existence also allows us to give players that faction change to Worgen something in exchange for their old racial mount. Right now if you faction change to Worgen you lose your previous home-faction mounts, and so we’re also trying to correct that with this change. <br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 4.3 Preview - Worgen Racial Mounts<br />
We're not going to make it very far without transportation, are we? If we just hightail it out of here, the forsaken will catch up to us in no time at all.<br />
<br />
Rounding up some horses from the stable grounds southeast of here would normally be a breeze, but there's one snag. That last quake must've spooked Koroth, the ettin, down from the mountains. If we don't get our horses soon, I fear that he will.<br />
<br />
In patch 4.3, we’ll be introducing worgen racial mounts to the stables of Azeroth. These sleek horses have been constant companions for the denizens of Gilneas since time immemorial, and your worgen characters will now be able to claim their ancestral mounts.<br />

It looks like Blizz got tired of people complaining that Worgen didn't get a mount so they were just like.. here have a horse. I think they would have put more thought into this if it was for April Fool's instead of this. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

Originally, the tauren did not have a mount, so when a tauren player reached level 40, they spoke to Horde [50] IconSmall Tauren Female.gif Saern Priderunner on the Hunter Rise of Thunder Bluff. The Plainsrunning ability itself was an aura with similar limitations to the mounts, but operated slightly differently. Plainsrunning was removed in Patch 1.1.0 and kodos became the tauren racial mounts. It would take 10 seconds of running before the skill would kick in and its maximum speed was as fast as a mount. The tauren would get a new version of the skill when they reached level 60; this skill's maximum speed was equal to an &quot;epic&quot; mount. Despite statements to the contrary, the Worgen Running Wild ability is quite similar in practice, if not in mechanics, to Plainsrunning. The skill was removed due to the following problems: * Mounts were a three second cast time, and lasted until dazed. Players normally do not dismount upon standing still; see below. * It took the full ten seconds to gain the speed every time, and the speed would dissipate every time the player was hit. * If the player stopped moving, the buff would go away and it would take ten seconds to reapply it. * Those limitations were designed to make sure tauren wouldn't run circles around others in PvP, but they clearly showed to be far inferior to a normal mount and nearly impossible to balance. * It would sometimes kick in at the worst possible moment, causing unwanted body pulls.</div></div><hr />

Better to have just left it with us having the &quot;Running Wild&quot; as the Worgen &quot;mount&quot;.<br />
<br />
What happened to the savage boar mount they showed at Blizzcon? That would have been cooler, and you could even create believable lore:&quot;After being cursed by the Worgen condition, the people of Gileneas struggled to find steed that could bear their feral natures. Few horses, rams and sabercats (commonly used as mounts by Alliance forces) would tolerate a worgen rider. However, Gilneans have discovered a sturdy, fearless breed of wild boar that show no fear of worgen riders and almost seem to relish charging into combat along side their cursed riders..&quot;</div></div><hr />

That would have been cooler, and you could even create believable lore:&quot;After being cursed by the Worgen condition, the people of Gileneas struggled to find steed that could bear their feral natures. Few horses, rams and sabercats (commonly used as mounts by Alliance forces) would tolerate a worgen rider. However, Gilneans have discovered a sturdy, fearless breed of wild boar that show no fear of worgen riders and almost seem to relish charging into combat along side their cursed riders..&quot;<br />
<br />
Yep, would have been nice I guess... maybe they'll add another mount on each side for pvp mounts (like the ones they had back in Vanilla and BC, the one 's you could buy with honor) Goblins get an Ogre, and Worgen get the battle Boar.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't bothered about them adding mounts, and admit its a nice gesture to balance the fact Goblins got Trikes, which tbh I don't like either. My issue is that Worgen look ridiculous on a horse (and would eat the horse) and yet that was apparently a reason we did not get the man-bear-pig? QQ I want the man-bear-pig, looked awesome in concept art.@Itm - It looks like a Worgen Rogue in Ruthless gear</div></div><hr />

Thats what I thought. Those are the most pathetic mounts I have seen. They really couldn't do any better? If your going to do horses (which is lame imo) atleast put some cool looking armor on them or something. Fail blizz... Fail!</div></div><hr />

Tbh Blizzard didn't have to implement anything for Worgens, they're probably doing this to balance out horde/alliance mount numbers so people from both sides can gain a similar number for the mount achievements. If people really don't like it keep using your racial. simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But alliance has two less mounts than horde, worgen were fine without a mount, sure, but the faction as a whole would have a harder time with the 100 mount achievement. Not saying that 100 mounts is hard, but if they intend to increase that to 150 (like with pets) those two extras will add up. And what better place to add them than the faction that does not have a mount?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Desminn</div><div class="date">2011-09-01, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok...first off this is obviously an attempt to even out the mounts on each side for the achievments.<br />
<br />
second, to anyone complaining that these are horses.....newsflash gilneans/worgen RODE horses! why is this a shocker? they fit lore wise.<br />
<br />
third, to those saying blizzard are wasting time with this and should be making more for 4.3 well....somehow i dont think this took much time at all (lol).<br />
<br />
fourth, most people complaining about lack of creativity in this would probably be lumped in with the people from my thrid point if they had put a lot of time into this.<br />
<br />
<br />
so in conclusion: stfu, you got the mount balance you wanted. i dont think (didnt see it say) your losing running wild, ride something else if you dont like it. gratz on getting the mounts you wanted blizzard heard you loud and clear ;) they tossed you a bone and all most of you can do is spit on them.<br />
<br />
ps: i do however feel they didnt really need to advertise this on such a large scale.</div></div><hr />

Quitting over the addition of mounts, this is a new one to me. <br />

Seriously though, it's not that original, as horses are already in game, but what else would HUMANS ride? They have been humans way longer than they have been worgen. They seem underwhelming, but chances are these are not finished models.</div></div><hr />

I can't find the image... but it's just the wild horses around the farm at Elwynn forrest from 6 years ago. They're the same model without the saddle. <br />

No, they never said any such thing. They're just adding these to the game in order to even out the balance with goblins.<br />
<br />
I just don't know WHY they made it an announcement, just using old horse models like that. It doesn't come across as something worth making a news article about.<br />

Should've just been in the patch notes: &quot;A Gilnean mount vendor has been added to Darnassus with two new horse mounts available, in order to balance the mount availability between Horde and Alliance.&quot;</div></div><hr />

How ironic. In an attempt to make a statement about why you quit (at least that's what I got from my personal decipher) you vomited up the same &quot;haha reuse&quot; garbage that most of the people in your position post every day... on a game site... for a game you don't play.<br />
<br />
Re use much?<br />
<br />
On topic: These aren't final models. As much as I dont give a damn about mounts in this game anymore (loldrakesandhorses) Blizzard isn't prepared to shoot themselves in the foot like that. They'll at least give them a gilneas tattoo or something. The horses in those picks are literally already in the game.</div></div><hr />

So what? Two wrongs don't equal a right. <br />
<br />
Maybe Blizzard should actually do what they used to do... when they do something they do it RIGHT. I used to support Blizz due to their policy of quality before quantity and release times... <br />
<br />
...there is no quality in this. None. Zero. It literally took them probably 30 seconds tops to copy/paste the mount code in from a wild Elwynn forrest horse model.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, the horse from the rated BGs achievement is a different horse model, excluding armor. Like, the actual horse is differently shaped. This might be the same one (different shaped horse than humans)<br />
<br />
Second, maybe it looks like a horse, but has a &quot;worgen-curse&quot; cosmetic mode that makes it like a fel/corrupted horse.<br />
<br />
Let's hope so...</div></div><hr />

When they get two mounts just to fill the gap (and note that there WERE NO GILNEAN REP MOUNTS BEFORE THIS) people are complaining. Lazy or not, it's a thing that, now pay attention, was not there before and caused complaining. Hell, I even remember people saying adding two generic horses would be better than having the Horde have easy access to two more mounts than the Alliance. Also, there's a huge implication here that most simply forgot. The vendor is presumably at that place where you meet Lorna Crowley and save her ponies. Gilneas so far has been a contested zone between Worgen and Forsaken, meaning no important Alliance NPCs. Some simple logic would imply there's something happening to Gilneas in 4.3... perhaps even a full-scale Alliance attack that manages to reclaim the zone.</div></div><hr />
