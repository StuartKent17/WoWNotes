Even though you're mistaken I've never understood this &quot;ultrawide is cheating&quot; thing. As someone said on the ow forums: <br />
<br />
&quot;Because not everyone has 21:9 screen so it gives an unfair advantage.<br />
<br />
Of course not everyone has a 144hz monitor, 244hz monitor, gaming mouse, gaming keyboard, state of the art hardware, gaming chair, good headset, or perfect internet; but these are allowed even tho they give more of an advantage than 21:9.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Going from 4:3 to 16:9 is just going with the current standard, nothing special.<br />
<br />
D3 and OW still have 16:9,</div></div><hr />

I was joking, i own a 21:9 screen and its just stupid to think that you will be in a disadvantage without it.<br />
Also 21:9 screens can be bought for 250$ if you can live with 29 inch and 1080p.</div></div><hr />

Sorry I didn't pick up the sarcasm :x<br />

<br />
Well, when you can see monsters that are typically 'offscreen' on a normal 16:9 screen, then you know ahead of time what's coming. Hell, you could play a caster on D3 and shoot mobs well off the screen a lot easier with a ultrawide monitor. <br />
<br />
Anything that's RTS, top down, having more real estate to see more real estate, gives you the upper hand in almost all situations within that game genre.<br />
<br />
But it's a hardware version of a FOV option on the software side. Remember when CRT monitors had higher resolutions than the standard 1080p or even 4k in today's society? I was doing 4800x2400 back in the 90s or whatever the highest resolution I could get. <br />
<br />
We've been at a disadvantage since the advent of 1080p for PC gaming.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, let's bring it down to lowest denominator and all play stones. This is following &quot;widescreen = cheating&quot; logic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most CRTs were 576p PAL or 480p NTSC the max resolution you could get was 1024Ã—768 pixels. The 'resolution' you chose in windows just made everything smaller on screen so you could fit more stuff in view. Very different from true resolution we see nowadays.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right?! I'm personally hoping for a Gamescom announcement, but I'm guessing that it'll probably be BlizzCon. That's not too terribly long of a wait, and I expect they have a head start thanks to the HD hero units they made for Starcraft 2, but still! I really want to play through the campaigns and start firing up custom maps again. :(</div></div><hr />

Yeah but I imagine like Starcraft they will throw the other 2 on there just for the sake of Remastering and having them directly on the current Battle.net.<br />
<br />
But yeah can't complain. Got Diablo 1 working fine on Windows 10.<br />

Right now though these updates do seem to point to a WC3 Remaster. Which I'll probably buy.</div></div><hr />

28 made RoC and TFT a single Exe anyhow. If your doing story Arguably start with coming of the Horde campaign from the hiveworkshop. And play OutsiderExs. Last Guardian, Day of the Dragon and Lord of the Clans book to campaign creations.<br />

I mean, you have to update it with Battle.net after installing from a disk, but you can still do that. Most people will just grab the installer from Battle.net's account settings since you can put in your old code and get online registration.</div></div><hr />

Start with RoC. Its campaign is more easier and story wise RoC then TFT. Also TFT have new attack types and armor types for units (its more complicated) so... its better start from RoC.:)<br />
<br />
TFT also have new units and heroes so if you new to game its better start with RoC.<br />

Also for those who started playing again there small tablet with attack and armor types (what do the most damage to what). Have fun.<br />
