PTR Build Deployment - 5/13/15<br />
Check back later today for another Patch 6.2 PTR build!<br />
Hello everyone!<br />
<br />
The PTR realms will soon be coming down in order to deploy a new 6.2 PTR build. The current ETA is around 6 to 8 hours.<br />
<br />
I'll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations are civil and adhere to forum guidelines.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Testing Schedule - May 14-18<br />
Sorry for the late notice, but we were waiting on PTR build status to confirm testing dates. From tomorrow through Monday, we will continue our Hellfire Citadel raid testing, including both Heroic and Mythic raid testing. As is always the case with PTR raid testing, it is quite possible that there will be technical or gameplay issues that disrupt our plans. Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.<br />
<br />
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic difficulty requires a fixed 20 players. Our general plan is to test every encounter on Heroic difficulty first, and then test sections of the raid on Normal and Raid Finder, alongside targeted Mythic tests.<br />
<br />
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below on all PTR servers.<br />
<br />
Thursday, May 14<br />
<br />
Socrethar - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
Archimonde - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
<br />
Friday, May 15<br />
<br />
Shadow-Lord Iskar - Mythic Hellfire Citadel - 11:30 PDT (14:30 EDT, 20:30 CEST)<br />
Hellfire High Council - Mythic Hellfire Citadel - 13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
<br />
After Mythic raid testing concludes on Friday, we will open the Bastion of Shadows Raid Finder wing, including Iskar, Socrethar, and Tyrant Velhari, over the weekend.<br />
<br />
Monday, May 18<br />
<br />
Iron Reaver - Heroic Hellfire Citadel - 13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
Mannoroth - Mythic Hellfire Citadel - 15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />

New Mystic Runesaber Mount — Now Available<br />
It looks like the mount (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/180545-mystic-runesaber) is incorrectly classified as a ground mount and it will be able to fly after all!<br />
Update 21:10 CEST -- We are experiencing technical difficulties with this item in the Blizzard Shop, and it is temporarily unavailable for purchase. We're working hard to fix that and we apologize for the inconvenience.<br />
<br />
The enigmatic Mystic Runesaber mount has manifested. Sheltered by chaotic arcane energy, these creatures have eluded capture for millennia. Now they’ve emerged from the shadows to hunt for new sources of magical power. Tame their wild energy and make one of these arcane allies yours!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The Mystic Runesaber mount is now available from the in-game Shop and Battle.net Shop (https://battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-mount-mystic-runesaber).<br />

Recent Actions Against Botting in WoW<br />
We’ve recently taken action against a large number of World of Warcraft accounts that were found to be using third-party programs that automate gameplay, known as “bots.” We’re committed to providing an equal and fair playing field for everyone in World of Warcraft, and will continue to take action against those found in violation of our Terms of Use. Cheating of any form will not be tolerated.<br />
<br />
If you believe that you’ve encountered a player abusing a bot, exploit, or cheat, please let us know! You can do so by using the right-click report functionality in the game, and/or by emailing information to hacks@blizzard.com.</div></div><hr />

So? how does that make it any fairer?<br />
<br />
If you used an in game exploit and got to level 90 using it you would be banned for....cheating. The only difference to the game is Blizzard didn't get paid.<br />

or you can easily make ~10k+ a week per character by simply doing 3-4 cata raids and garrison. i started this expac with 15k gold, i now have 85k. i gave away 45k so a friend could get the flaming horse mount. i spent 30k on heirlooms. if you NEED gold then you'd better start putting in the minimum amount of effort because this expansion literally prints gold. as for the cash shop? who gives a shit, it's 100% optional. you don't even have to look at it unless you choose to bring that menu up. as for instant 90? again, who gives a shit. if they want to play/learn a class and are who lazy to level themselves, who cares. it's their money they are wasting, not yours.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't care less if some idiot likes throwing money away. I questioning how Blizzard can say &quot;fair and level playing field for all&quot; when they are actively selling in game advantages in their shop. What is does show is they rank profit first game play second.</div></div><hr />

how does instant 90 make you have an advantage. unless you know what you're doing *and quite frankly, a lot of people don't*, you're going to be useless until you figure it out. it takes maybe a few days if you're dedicated to level to 90. a lot less if you have a couple of those triple xp pots. it's a convenience. an advantage would be something like +stats or drop rate or shit like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you feel that way then just don't buy the mount. Im tired of these kinds of posts when people cry about the cost of a purely cosmetic addition to the game. This mount will in no way make you a better player then the guy next to you. Speaking from exp, the people who buy these mount only get real enjoyment from them for maybe a week or two, if that long. There is a reason people call them &quot;vanity&quot; mounts. If you cant afford it and you want it then try saving some money. Maybe you will enjoy something more when it just wasn't given to you for free.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it really bothers you that someone would waste their money on a level 90 char? Does it also bother you that people would waste their money on the stupid shop mounts too? Both have an equal effect on the game-lives of everyone at 100 (hint: not at all). If someone is botting to level their char, that can actually ruin other people's experience because it's killing mobs that would've otherwise been there for people legitimately leveling a new char. I've personally seen this and reported plenty of people for botting to level their characters. It blows my mind that they would pay for a bot and run the risk of permaban rather than either save $60 to get to 90 instantly, or just do it little by little. There's nothing wrong with taking 3-4 months to level a character to max level when you're not even going to be playing them very often.<br />
<br />
There is something to be said about Blizzard basically selling gold with the tokens because that can work to ruin the in-game economy, but buying a boost to level 90 is hardly ruining anyone's play experience. Personally, I like the tokens because I had like 500k gold when they came out, so now I'm playing for free for at least the next year. Besides, the tokens haven't really had much of a discernible effect on the economy</div></div><hr />

First time when I heard about microtransaction in WoW was in one asian interview during 5.2/5.3 interview and I hoped that it´s a joke. But now they are pushing those microtransaction harder then new content. So this isn´t cool. Microtransaction are fine in Heroes of the Storm ... it perfectly sets for that type of game, but for WoW its not the right way.</div></div><hr />

After filling in my report he later stated that he had obtained several mounts through botting and advised another person to do the same, claiming &quot;They can't tell, trust me&quot;. Earlier today a mutual friend told me that the person posted a screenshot on a facebook group of his account being banned for 6 months.<br />
<br />
I really appreciate that Blizzard is working to keep the game clean and fair for everyone and I just wanted to share my story to vouch for the fact that they are indeed taking actions against bots and they are not just false claims meant to discourage rulebreakers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WELL LOOKY-FUCKIN' HERE!<br />
<br />
If you are genuinely surprised this mount flies, I actually feel sorry for you.<br />
<br />
And Blizz: fuck you.</div></div><hr />

But &quot;large&quot; number of wow players could be majority of the population, I heard this from a friend so maybe he got it confused from Q1 loss.</div></div><hr />

IF that's true... I called way back in WoD beta that this shitty expac would drop WoW to 5.5 million subs. And yet, I can't even get a single lottery number lately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah WoW turned to shit after WOTLK or even BC I guess blizzard decided to drop the hammer since most botters use gold now to play. Blizzard lost nothing if paid with gold. But yeah this would be one of the biggest hits since the first bot Glider. So I would say 1.5million is a understatement.</div></div><hr />

Im tired of these kinds of posts when people cry about the cost of a purely cosmetic addition to the game. This mount will in no way make you a better player then the guy next to you. Speaking from exp, the people who buy these mount only get real enjoyment from them for maybe a week or two, if that long. There is a reason people call them &quot;vanity&quot; mounts. If you cant afford it and you want it then try saving some money. Maybe you will enjoy something more when it just wasn't given to you for free.<br />
<br />
Mate your the one crying, all he said was the video looked better then what patch's get. If you don't like what he is saying then ignore it and move on, stop been a fan boy and crying over others not been happy over a poorly down X-pack. Blizzard are not going to hire u for licking there boot.</div></div><hr />

Fuck blizzard, go honorbuddy! <br />
Continue to allow people to farm gold and sell for real money!<br />
<br />
Ps. I don't play wow anymore nor do I bot anymore. <br />
But it was fun making a few hundred dollars a week for nothing</div></div><hr />

Cause elaizer said its so...<br />
<br />
Seriously you remedial pre teen, what proof could he possibly have? Saved his blizzard email from months ago for a game he isn't playing in order to placate some weenie in the future?<br />
<br />
I'll stop - my brain is beginning to hurt.<br />
<br />
That being said, read and read some more. They don't just accidently ban, they do it frequently. I've known several people who have had it happened and subsequently overturned, especially auto bans.<br />
<br />
What's that analogy about arguing with an idiot?</div></div><hr />

<br />
well maybe not suicide but that wasnt even shot in the foot - its was more like knife to the belly - with those people gone many of their friends will follow too including many of the raiders from the guilds that will collapse due to no being able to replace 5-6 people in 7-9/10 mythic guilds. <br />
<br />
sad days for wow are coming really sad. <br />
<br />
botting is wrong but they couldnt choose worse moment to do it - guess activision force them to action after loosing that lawsuit of honorbuddy.</div></div><hr />

How am I supposed to prove it? They won't even tell you what they are banned you for, if you ask they just repeatedly say &quot;using third party programs&quot;</div></div><hr />

Bought a time token with gold.<br />

Blizzard fooled me again !</div></div><hr />

Ah this game is doomed for failure. Promoting mounts over promoting the in game content or awesome new raid. Blizzard WoW sucks just face it you guys failed to keep your original players and with that you lost a lot of hardcore players. I would like to see the active count vs people not logged in. You may have 7 million active accounts but I bet half are not playing just keeping it active via gold.</div></div><hr />
