I was wondering if in the future they were any plans to make races across the board more customization, when you place all armor on them they look the same<br />
Currently there aren't any solid plans but we are tossing around some stuff. <br />
<br />
Any plans of adding a guild merging system?<br />
we don't have any plans for a feature, but merging a guild is easier to do in cata due to the easier interface. <br />

I love what you guys done with wow, I love you have a lot of strong female chars, I wonder if we can have some that didnt look like they came out of victoria's secrets catalogue?<br />

@ Class Q&amp;A we had 1 question about Demon Soul being just a trinket, basically got answered they dont like to give us 'proper spells' u use a lot, just things u use from time to time... @ Open Q&amp;A there was only 1 about mastery being boring for warlocks, blizz seemed to be fine with that, mastery just should make u better at stuff, not change your rotation</div></div><hr />

I can't tell if he is being sarcastic about Karazhan, because I would love them to open up the bottom part of that instance that you can sneak into, scariest place in the game by far.<br />
<br />
It would be interesting to have a 5 man instance under Kara or something to that effect, maybe tie it into Thrall's journey.<br />
<br />
Also, good lord these people ask shitty question.<br />

Also the question about a 'closet' for event-based items would be great, something that is account based that all your chars could access so you could get the achieves from the events on all your characters instead of just one at a time(which is a major pain in the ass).</div></div><hr />

Q: Why did you remove the support role of the Shadowpriest?<br />

In cata we have a new faction, they counter to the explorers league. Lor'themar is absolutely being developed to a more leadership-ish position. we absolutely want to put him in the front.<br />
<br />
I don't know whether to laugh or cry. Blood Elves were hugely involved in wotlk (Sunreavers, etc), yet where were the draenei? We had a small platoon in Borean Tundra, and their reinforcements were stopped due to that nasty little blood prince, and one huge odd-sounding draenei in Icc right before the frost wyrm before your board the Alliance ship. I mean, if Blood Elves &quot;weren't a large part in wotlk&quot;, then Draenei weren't a part at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very disappointing. I guess the fact that it is pretty easy to get bored without the variety of different toons doesn't matter to them :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
LMAO!! Who asked this gay ass question?</div></div><hr />

Why dont they just do a talent tree for PVP.<br />
Also you should prevent people from using PVE gear in PVP and PVP gear in PVE.<br />
If they want to PVP let them spend gold on a starter set and upgrade from there.<br />
They should focus an idea to get people to pvp all over Azeroth against each othe. Capital cities and towns should be targets at all times like it was during tarren mills and southshore during vanilla wow.<br />
I really hate that there is no conflict between horde and alliance, its like they are going to make all races combine together soon and go hang out in every capital city like we do now with shattrah and dalaran which to me was a terrible idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Male Worgen dance looks good??? How the heck... I have lost all faith with the devs after that comment in making Worgen awesome live. The bugs I see in Beta and just a month away... Deeply sadden...</div></div><hr />

<br /> 
And his excuse is that it's more fun for the designers to design a big weapon like a staff. Did anyone see their last legendary staff? It was a stick with a feather at the top.<br />
<br />
Another expansion and still no legendary for either Shaman DPS Spec.<br />
<br />

Now I know why the content was dumbed down into oblivion, and you just have to look at the questions these idiots were asking that were probably not worth the plane ticket.<br />
<br />
However, I am going to say that Blizzard handled this very unprofessionally and the odd question that did question the current game flaws/mechanics, they got a bit snippy and arrogant suggesting everything is working as intended. <br />
<br />
So it's a double-edged sword; Dumb-ass questions that probably irritated the developers, and the unprofessional behavior displayed the by the staff.</div></div><hr />

I like the dog pet a lot (Gilnean dog pet) any plans on making it more ferocious?<br />
Maybe we can make them a little meaner, give them rabies or something.<br />
<br />
If you watched the live feed, you most likely heard someone in the audience yell out how to fix the issue brought up above.<br />
<br />
While the panel was thinking about an answer to the question I yelled out to them to give them Rabies...they thought about it for a split second and said hmm... we could do that...<br />
