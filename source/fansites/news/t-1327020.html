Blue Posts<br />
Epic Item Prestige<br />
I don’t think this will change any time soon but I must say that I sympathize with what you’re saying, This isn’t a “special snowflake syndrome”. Sure, there might be a little bit of that involved, but it’s mostly a matter of perception, and perception is a very important factor in driving motivation. <br />
<br />
If a colour is associated with rarity, that colour becomes important by itself, and that’s something that only the most old school players probably understand, still feel, or miss.<br />
<br />
What I’m saying is, there was a time when having 1 single purple item was something absolutely amazing, they were not only the very best items but they were also incredibly rare.<br />
<br />
That rarity was a consequence of a combination of many things: <br />
<br />
Raids were hard to get into.<br />
Only a very small minority was actually able to raid.<br />
Players were much less skilled than they are nowadays, so killing raid bosses was done at a much slower pace. Content was also updated much less frequently.<br />
Apart from the very first 40man raids (Molten Core, Ony), the chance of getting any epic items at all was incredibly small (world drop BoEs)<br />
<br />
<br />
So the colour purple meant two things, extreme power and rarity. But the game soon evolved, more raids were introduced, and all these new items that came with it were epic.<br />
<br />
Nowadays purple means power, rarity hmm… not so much, maybe at the very beginning of an expansion. <br />
<br />
But you see, that’s exactly the same that happened in vanilla, the only difference was that raids were a lot less accessible and less diverse (so, less overall chance of getting raid drops), and the patch turnaround with new raid content was much slower, which means, less availability of epic items. There were also no catch up mechanics set in place, so players had to go through all the clearly defined gearing paths of green-blue-purple (quests, 5man, 10man, 40man), and also follow a progression path with raids ZG/MC, Ony, BwL, Naxx.<br />
<br />
We don’t want to restrict raiding again to &lt;1% of the player base, and that’s the only way to go back to purple being rare again. Reducing LFR gear to blue wouldn’t make a big difference, there’s plenty of other sources of high ilvl gear that would need to be changed to blue, and even if we did that and only normal + heroic would drop epics, we would never have the same level of rarity as in the old days, content is just so much more diverse, more regularly updated and players are way more skilled. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265436-epic-isnt-epic/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7860746695?page=2#36))<br />

Patch 5.4 Arena Changes<br />
With this system, and how the wow community is nowadays, why would I even want to play with my friends I might lose with? <br />
If you’re afraid to play rated games with your friends because you don't want to lose matches or rating, then I'm afraid that there is not a lot that can be done to help you with that. The possible losses caused by playing with lesser skilled friends is the same as now though, if you leave your current team to play with some friends and you end up losing, your MMR will drop, which is the key number that matters and influences the way your personal and team ratings change.<br />
<br />
If you want to play with friends without a fear of losing rating in the process, then I would recommend playing wargames. We're also looking into bringing back skirmish arenas which will help in this regard, but sadly we have no date set for when they will return.<br />
<br />
how do YOU think that community will act towards a person who got twice as much losses than wins in arena <br />
It won't be much different to how it is now for finding partners. If you’re a 1500 player, then generally you're going to greatly struggle finding a 2400+ team that is likely to take you on. Same goes for in 5.4, with a personal rating of 1500 and low win rate you're going to be looking for people with similar ratings or stats. If you're aiming to get partners above your personal level, it won't be easy, finding partners that are around your level and improving yourself with them is the best way to get teammates.<br />
<br />
Just going to address this concern here; for those that queue with people who have a low ratings to fight weaker opponents, the players with higher ratings won't get much, if anything, out of those matches. This is because their own personal ratings are above their teams and opponents average.<br />
<br />
Additionally, almost all rating exploits in the past have involved some sort of win trading or a loophole in the system itself. We've plugged up any of the loopholes that we've encountered, and due to the higher volume of players in the Arena pool that will be created from the region-wide matchmaking, there will be significantly less opportunity for win trading.

Lore<br />
[i]The fact that the Alliance gives the Horde Org back with no concessions or reparations suck<br />
It's an important Jaina vs Vyrian moment. Who is to say the High King made the right call? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357379234521546752))<br />
<br />
We ever going to find out why Taran Zhu has it in for the Alliance? The Horde we can see...but he is so wrong about so much.<br />
His goal is to protect Pandaria. He can be a bit xenophobic since outsiders can empower the Sha. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/350646570707988481))<br />
<br />
Do you feel the LORE of Mists could have been stronger? Don't know why we did HoF and ToT, other than, &quot;lets kill stuff!&quot;<br />
What was your motivation behind killing Illidan or Ragnaros? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347192997202522112))<br />
Story in that expansion was very compelling. Arthas had a lot of backstory revealed. Scourge felt threatening.<br />
Maybe, though I find it hard to separate what LK taught us vs. what many of us already knew about Arthas from the RTS games. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/347391759816482817))<br />
<br />
we had a reason to want to fight them. no reason to want to kill lei-shen except blizz saying we should.<br />
Arthas, Illidan and Deathwing are easy because many remember them from the RTS days. Illidan was barely present in BC. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/345673305837142016))<br />
especially since some get outright ignored like Sabellian. i feel like you all forgot who he is.<br />
That particular case is more that we have a cast of 1000s and can't bring them all out every expansion. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/345675736662806529))<br />
<br />
Will the vale turn back to its original state after the whole siege? Seeing all those big black blobs makes me a bit sad.<br />
To be fair, it's supposed to make you sad. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/346770894854692864))<br />
<br />
I have a feeling that y'shaarj is the true baddie in this expansion amirite?<br />
He is dead. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/345673427400683520))<br />
<br />
I'm so sad that Nazgrim gonna die <br />
It's tough because it's always more emotional when you care about the characters involved. The alternate though is not to care. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/345351102910320640))<br />
<br />
what exclusive is there then? Ra-den isn't story relevant. we've never seen him or heard of him<br />
That you initially don't know who he is or how he fits in is WHY he is story relevant. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343807582726676480))<br />
Mogu. Titan. Old god. Sha. Mantid. All these things are connected. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343807716415918080))<br />
<br />
Sometimes it's too obv how little you care about the story/lore of the game.<br />
We care ENORMOUSLY about the story and lore. But we care about gameplay more. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357518766139121664))<br />
<br />
Will the Alliance receive compensation lore wise (Doesnt have to be in game) after SoO?<br />
They just conquered their enemy's capital. What compensation are you looking for? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356135336847486976))<br />
Do Allies gain NOTHING from this war except tens of 1000s dead and their lands stolen? Not even in lore? Goblins keep Azshara<br />
Garrosh is the real problem, not the trolls and goblins. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357381732187639810))<br />
Lore-wise we could say that zones changed hands but wouldn't it be lame once you visited them and saw that was not the case? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357381898651185153))<br />
It's always a challenge doing a lot of work just for lore reasons unless it comes with awesome gameplay too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357382043971231744))<br />
shouldn't multi-billionaire devs be relishing a challenge rather than cowering away from it??<br />
Or one can argue WoW has been successful because the developers made the right choices about where to focus.... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/357516101736857600))<br />
<br />
Like making the Horde back out of Gilneas and Ashenvale?<br />
<br />
I'm a gameplay designer. So what gameplay is there in losing leveling zones for Horde? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356164552624312320))<br />
If Alliance players had some interesting way to spend time there, that would be different. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356164765837574146))<br />

Future<br />
1st Dwarfs are on the bubble of MOP release then models may make it during MOP. Now it's &quot;they take months&quot; among others.<br />
We never said that. Players just inferred it and got too excited. It makes us have to be careful with what we say. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/349193488069435393))<br />
<br />
Hi, do you have any thoughts yet about 5.0 Challenge Modes for next x-pac?. Will they still be in-game or replaced with new?<br />
Our thought at the moment is to keep the older ones relevant (they do scale) and add new ones. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/349192582867329025))<br />
<br />
Here's a teaser I understand if you don't answer; do you think avoidance on gear is going to make it to 6.0?<br />
I don't expect it will work the day it does today. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/348453369091862529))<br />
<br />
any public word u can offer up on the future of sunsong farms in future expansions?<br />
We don't want you to feel like you have to go visit it forever. It's a MoP feature. It will still be there for you though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/356173594092503041))<br />

Right... and why would they introduce an item they don't want everyone to use?<br />
<br />
If they wanted it to be rare they'd put it behind a skill-cap, not a pay-wall.<br />

That's a fair argument I guess.<br />
<br />
Only issue with that is that this isn't a service, or access to one. This is something they've added to the game several times for free. The fact that they're starting to charge for it now shows a scary change in their philosophy.</div></div><hr />

They charge us a subscription then on top of that sell us gear that costs us WAY more than other free to play mmo's. That is called greedy. There is never a shortage of morons willing to pay for it though so good for them. Also lol @ free content. We buy the box, we buy the expansions, we pay monthly, stfu.</div></div><hr />

This argument holds no water: HBO, Showtime, etc are all separate companies from the cable companies. That's why they charge for those channels.</div></div><hr />

For me it is a deal breaker. It's not cosmetic at all and enhances your gameplay. Greedy is greedy.<br />
And the next item will alow to aquire more lesser Charms of Good Fortune. And this is only the beginning.<br />

This is fine for a F2P Game but not for a subscription based.</div></div><hr />

No, the elixir isn't necessary. You can level fairly fast to 90 without it.<br />
Here's a tip: Don't buy it!<br />

Depending on price I might get some, but they are not a deal breaker nor are they obligated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont want to disappoint you, but do you really think they will introduce a whole new in game shop just for an exp boost and the items they can already offer? I doubt that.<br />
As far as i see we are going down the path of a f2p game model (at least shop wise), except they will never go to f2p with millions of subs.<br />

First off, people are getting upset and arguing over things that have not even taken place yet, mostly in regards to the eventual addition of &quot;pay to win&quot; items. I will admit that I am not the biggest fan of the addition of even xp% potions to the store. But even if I wont be purchasing them myself, they really do not cause any harm to my current and future game play. I have heard stories, and seen videos of people leveling at ludicrous speeds (85-90 in a matter of hours?!?!), yet people complain because some people may drop some hard earned money to boost their xp for a few hours? The cable company analogy used above is acctually very accurate when it comes to this situation. As with WoW, you pay a monthly sub for your cable for a set amount of channels. For any &quot;extra&quot; channels or features including PPV, additional channels, and features such as DVR or ability to watch TV on the go, you may pay additional monthly or one time fees. These extras are in no way needed to enjoy your television experience but they simply add to the experience and are all based on your preference and are in many cases there to impress your friends (Everyone knows the guy with all the channels who orders all the PPVs and is always the place to be come Sundays), just like everyone in WoW knows the guy (or gal) with all the store mounts and pets that we can ooh and ahh over. <br />
<br />
So in the end, I personally am going to save all my flaming of Blizzard for being &quot;Play to Win&quot; or anything of that nature until they have 100% implemented it into the live game. <br />
<br />
I just think we are all debating and arguing over a future, which in my opinion, is still a LONG ways off if it ever arrives at all.</div></div><hr />

The only problem I have with this statement is its like a lot of others that make the assumption that there is a slippery slope that Blizzard has to slide down. The problem is that people are comparing the Cash Shop of a game with 7+ million subs, to the cash shops of F2P games that are lucky to break 1 million. An XP pot is no where near gear or any other p2w item.</div></div><hr />

but they are a pretty nice little boost to maybe get to 90 in under a day if you bought 20 of them lol.<br />

Content was also updated much less frequently.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was the funniest part of the post. Because it is a known fact that players that played in BC and orcs and humans can out play majority of players today even in the hardcore scene. Back then it took way more research and time to kill bosses cause we didn't have as many outside sources to do so. Add ons and third party websites. That takes no skill, sorry. To further back my point today's top guilds were barely making top 10 back in that day. With the exception of paragon, blood legion and method couldn't hold a candle to teams like death and taxes or sk gaming. Most players from that day and age moved on cause the game was getting to easy alla lich king. one last thing Always remember Muru the single hardest encounter ever in wow that devs swore to never do again. Some will argue he was broken but don't forget he was still getting killed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Because its a known fact&quot;.... I have to laugh at those statements. It's the kind of thing people who say &quot;literally&quot; as if it was a emphasis interjection would say. <br />
Let's move AGAIN the discussion from &quot;Joe's guild could kill it&quot; and &quot;I'm closer to what Joe's guild does than you&quot; as midcore likes to point, and check the FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. <br />
It's just the subscription of Joe's guild and the midcore remoras that pay the development of those raid most people can't reach? Or Joe's Guild and the midcore remoras are using a raid which development was paid for EVERYONE'S SUBSCRIPTIONS as e-peen?<br />
For how long that can keep going? THINK in how motivated the developers will be to hear your pleas when you're the part that pay for their desserts. And ignore the parts that pay for their houses, clothes, food, cars, etc... See for what you people REALLY are, not the distorted vision you have of yourselves.<br />

Well you would only use it for the free month you get paying the $20 for the RAF account.<br />

One would hope that would happen, but the powerful call of the almighty dollar is clearly becoming stronger and stronger for them.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the value proposition from WoW has gone down in my eyes in the past couple years. Spending $15 a month in any of the several quality F2P titles out there typically gets you more than the $15/mo that is required just to play, and the only reason WoW isn't completely blown out of the water in this respect is because they've had over 8 years to develop a backlog of content that people can spend time in. More and more F2P/B2P/subcriptionless games are letting you access all/nearly all of the content for free and putting vanity/convenience in the store, and a few are even letting you earn these same cosmetics/conveniences in the game if you so choose.<br />
<br />
In terms of what you get for $15 a month, there are several good options out there that offer as much or more than WoW does for the same price, so yeah...the value proposition has definitely gone down. Throwing convenience micro-transactions on top of it - which, unlike the one time purchase mounts and pets, are meant to be purchased repeatedly - not helping.<br />
<br />

<br />
The only problem I have with this statement is its like a lot of others that make the assumption that there is a slippery slope that Blizzard has to slide down. The problem is that people are comparing the Cash Shop of a game with 7+ million subs, to the cash shops of F2P games that are lucky to break 1 million. An XP pot is no where near gear or any other p2w item.<br />
<br />
The majority of cash shops in F2P games in the Western market don't sell pay to win items (anything by Perfect World notwithstanding) - their bread and butter is convenience and vanity. Selling convenience for cash is mostly accepted (some groups consider even this to be pay to win...check out GGG's stance regarding Path of Exile) because of the lack of a required fee and the need for the company to monetize something, and convenience monetizes incredibly well.</div></div><hr />

MMOs are not that large while F2P games in general have gotten quite large like LoL's 32 million players with one of the main sources of income coming from cosmetic character skins.<br />

Not to mention Steam sales and price reductions in general of games that not only offer something new but also engaging for a comparable price or less based on rate of content consumption as I have gotten older and play games less. I picked up borderlands 2 for ten bucks and that will likely last me a couple of months. I picked up MassEffect3 at launch and still play the multiplayer over a year later which had gotten a number of free multi player DLC. I have been playing it this long because it is fun and not because they dangle epics in front of my face. There are many other games out there that are offering engaging gameplay for casual gamers that WoW doesnt target anymore for less monetary investment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they wanted it to be rare they'd put it behind a skill-cap, not a pay-wall.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's a fair argument I guess.<br />
<br />
Only issue with that is that this isn't a service, or access to one. This is something they've added to the game several times for free. The fact that they're starting to charge for it now shows a scary change in their philosophy.<br />
How so, we do not own anything in wow - we pay for access to thier server. It is a lot more similar than we might think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the Issue is that we are already charged to play the game, to access their servers, to be further charge by micro transactions is a scary turn. <br />
It leave the door open for speculation as to where this turn might take the game, With this &quot;catch up&quot; feature being something you need to Pay extra for I feel it would open the door for people who have the money but not the skill and LFD and LFR will get even worse, We already have DK's 20 lvls in advance from where they started at lvl 55 that have no clue how to play their class.<br />
<br />
Aside from the obvious ingame worries there is also the worry that they take it a step further, letting you buy Gear or other items from their &quot;in game store&quot; that gives you an edge on other playes of equal level or gear that can be aquired no where else.<br />

I agree with you 100%, I've played other MMo's that have an &quot;ingame store&quot; its terrible and alienates the players further, our community took a hard hit with LFD and LFR both in game and out, and I would hate to see it furthered by the &quot;in gmae&quot; store.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Titan will not be a subscription based MMO.<br />
The decline in subscribers in Q2 was more evenly split between Asia and the West.<br />
Blizzard will continue to work on making the process of rejoining the game smoother.<br />
The subscriber churn rate was very positively impacted by Patch 5.2 and 5.3.<br />
Blizzard All-Stars is in wider internal testing and will be talked about more later this year.<br />
Diablo 3 has sold over 12 million copies.<br />
<br />
Is EXTREMELY bad news and for those zealots that still support blindly, a final nail in coffin. This is extremely bad news. Where has my game gone, the one that hooked half the planet? &quot;Well, the answer is, and according to us here at Blizzard, the best possible news for you, we have been very hard at work!!!! We can soon announce other games...&quot;<br />

A. They just conquered their enemy's capital. What compensation are you looking for? (Source)<br />

Maybe the lack of understanding of Alliance comes the fact that he calls our King Vyrian instead of Varian. Really?<br />

Yep why don't you go out and farm that 5% droprate single use item and come back and tell us just how much &quot;better&quot; it is. The store flask is there without any sort of rng and all it requires is money, can even get as many as you want. Where as the dread wastes item has some of the worst rare mob rng in pandaria and you only get one, in the time it takes you to farm even one flask(if you're not extremely lucky) you could have gained all those levels you wanted to gain with the flask without it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a more fundamental problem with free to play though; and it's in the word play. <br />
During play, whether it's football, tag or world of warcraft, players enter what Johan Huizinga called a 'magic circle' in which things like status, rank or individual wealth are temporarily suspended for the duration of the game. It doesn't matter how much one football player or the other earns, the moment he's on the field all are equal and have to play by the same rules.<br />
This isn't even only true for humans; it's true for all animals that engage in play behaviour (chimps, but also dogs, dolphins, etc.). They 'play fair'.<br />
<br />
By introducing real money into the game, in-game purchases break this fundamental part of the magic circle. Such a store goes against our instincts: no wonder so many people get upset about it.</div></div><hr />

This isn't even only true for humans; it's true for all animals that engage in play behaviour (chimps, but also dogs, dolphins, etc.). They 'play fair'.<br />
<br />
By introducing real money into the game, in-game purchases break this fundamental part of the magic circle. Such a store goes against our instincts: no wonder so many people get upset about it.<br />
<br />
Wow that was unexpected to see someone quote Huizinga here on the board :D Read some of his stuff last semester at university! :)</div></div><hr />

750% additional xp gain?</div></div><hr />

Consumed on use. At first I was pretty stoked about the XP boost, but if it's consumed on use, forget it. It would have to be hella cheap for me to buy it.<br />
<br />
Soooo, just another thing I won't purchase!<br />
<br />
Ugh yea that was my reaction too. I was hoping for something $20-30 one time purchase and lifetime use. If it's more than $1 per stack I can't see myself buying that... so basically I can't see myself buying it because there's no way it's gonna be that cheap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When we place the mouse over it, it says stack up to 5... But now, thinking about it, it seems like its the max stack of this item... XD</div></div><hr />

I will see people now with average 3-5 toons, with this it will most likely increase to 8-10 or close. <br />
<br />
Enduring Elixir of Wisdom i really dont expect to see a big cost for this item. raf u can do with low cost and last 3 months buff, heirlooms last forever but this item only last 1 hour and if it is consume on use, it should cost mostly nothing at all.</div></div><hr />

DO you honestly think it has a chance in hell of being $1 per stack?<br />

Only a tiny portion of WoW has RaF so your example is extreme.<br />
<br />
The fact that most people have 5-10 alts is the reason for quicker exp.. its not fun any more to level after youve done it time and time again. Same reason they nerf exp by 50% after awhile.<br />

<br />
if you're shocked in any way whatsoever that Blizz has a Marketplace store, you haven't followed MMORPG community at all.. In Fact, Blizzard is like 6 years late. If addicts want to spend more money, why shouldnt they? Horrible business model to only allow an extremely addicted person to spend only $15/month on the game they dedicate their lives to. Blizzard already has a mount/pet store, whats so wrong with adding cosmetics and exp potions? <br />
<br />
Is leveling an alt in WoW seriously buy2win in 2013? Get real.<br />

The ingame store will make hitting that 'cancel subcription' button so much easier.<br />
<br />
The store thats been here for YEARS, where you can buy mounts and pets unobtainable in game? OH MY GOD but NOW all of a sudden its pay2winzz!@11</div></div><hr />
