<br />
World of Warcraft’s achievements system will launch with more than 500 individual achievements covering every aspect of gameplay, including world exploration, PvE, PvP, professions, and character development; from the purely whimsical to the truly epic, there will be something for everyone. Some achievements come with in-game rewards such as tabards, vanity pets, and titles. All of these rewards are purely cosmetic and just for fun, but you’ll certainly stand out when you proudly display them.<br />
<br />
And don’t fret about running out of achievements anytime soon. The list is easily expandable, so you can expect additional achievements with each new World of Warcraft content update. <br />
<br />
The Achievements Window<br />
Upon starting your journey in Wrath of the Lich King, you’ll see a new button on your main action bar. Click that button to bring up the achievements window.<br />
<br />
The top of the window displays the total number of points you’ve received for completing achievements. Below, each achievement appears with its name, description, point value, the completion date, and a progress bar (if applicable). Some achievements expand to display a list of individual components, highlighted to show which parts you’ve finished. You can also designate which achievements to track as you play, similar to the existing quest tracker. An important design goal is to provide players with everything they need to know to unlock an achievement.<br />
<br />
It’s great to be able to see your own achievements -- but it’s even better to let the world know what you’ve accomplished. By right-clicking other players and selecting the appropriate option, you can compare your achievements to theirs. Every time you earn a new achievement, your accomplishment is announced to your guild and everyone in your immediate vicinity -- and the custom achievement animation and sound effect are unmistakable. Also, your achievements will be viewable on the Armory, allowing you to track and show off your accomplishments via the web. <br />
<br />
Feats of Strength<br />
Feats of Strength represent the past glories of Azeroth, and as such, players will find them very difficult -- if not impossible -- to earn. They’re worth no points, and unlike normal achievements, unearned Feats are not displayed in the achievements interface. Feats include old-world player-vs.-player ranks, obtaining rare mounts, special titles, and more. Feats of Strength will be awarded retroactively (that is, they’ll be immediately granted to your character if you qualify) since many of them will be impossible to earn in Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
<br />
<br />
Types and Categories of Achievements<br />
World of Warcraft’s achievements come in several varieties. Some simply require specific actions to unlock, such as getting a haircut or defeating a member of each race in your opposing faction in PvP. Others involve a progress bar and require you to do something several times -- such as give out 10 hugs. Some achievements are progressive; for example, once you complete an achievement to collect 10 vanity pets, you might next be asked to collect 25. Finally, meta achievements unlock when you complete other achievements -- unlocking all World Exploration achievements (see below) unlocks a World Explorer meta achievement. Some achievements, including those that involve quests, honorable kills, items currently in your possession, skills (including professions), exploration, and reputations, will be applied to your character retroactively.<br />
<br />
To help keep track of all the different achievements you can unlock, you’ll find the following categories in the achievements window: <br />
<br />
Player-vs.-Player<br />
This includes arena, battlegrounds, and world player-vs.-player objectives. A few examples:<br />
Hot Streak: Win 10 ranked arena matches in a row.<br />
Alterac Valley All-Star: Capture graveyards, towers, and kill the enemy leader all in one game.<br />
City Defender: Kill 50 enemy players in your faction’s capital cities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
Every end boss of every raid and dungeon in the game grants its own achievement. Future achievements in this category may include ones for completing a run without any player deaths, with fewer than the maximum number of players, or within a certain time limit.<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Advancing to each tier of mastery in a profession earns you an achievement, and there are specific achievements for secondary skills (with major professions to follow).<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
Quest-based achievements (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/july/ssAchievements4.jpg) include completing a certain number of quests and completing specific quest lines. This category contains zone-specific subcategories.<br />
<br />
Events<br />
Seasonal events such as the Midsummer Festival, the Lunar Festival, and Hallows’ End have specific achievements of their own.<br />
<br />
World Exploration<br />
You’ll earn achievements by exploring each zone (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/july/ssAchievements3.jpg) in the game -- and get meta-achievements when you fully explore a continent.<br />
<br />
Reputations<br />
This set of achievements includes attaining exalted reputation with each faction in the game.<br />
<br />
General<br />
These achievements tend toward the whimsical, including getting a shave and haircut (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/july/ssAchievements2.jpg) (a new feature of Wrath of the Lich King), obtaining a certain number of tabards and vanity pets, falling from a great height, and more.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't detract at all from normal gameplay and you can get special rewards for truly epic achievements (killing high end raid bosses). *It took them all of ten seconds to add and didn't do anything to the development of the rest of the game. *You're getting fucking bitchy over nothing. *<br />
<br />
<br />
/agree<br />
Why are so many people bitching about something that is totally optional? If you don't like it then don't open the window, it will be like it never happened. It is like saying you don't like the color of the underside of your floor mats in your car, so you will not drive it any more....lol. I think it is a cool edition, gives people something to do when they are bored. Though they never really did say what the &quot;points&quot; were for exactly.<br />
<br />
Also, did anyone else notice some of the new armor in these pics?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not one to refrain from expressing my annoyance at the increasing casualness of the game, but I think this is a great example of adding something many differnt types of players can enjoy, while not doing anything to detract really from any other aspect of the game. Good addition IMO</div></div><hr />

In fact this is lack of focus in terms of what the game should be about if you ask me. But it seems that my opinion is a minority here so I will avoid to comment further on this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenyatta</div><div class="date">2008-07-17, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's amazing what people will complain about. It's the little things we take for granted and later appreciate. If this was there from the beginning, there would be no complaining about it and by this point, you'd have ignored it, blown it off, turned it off or simply forgot about it by now. By adding some little stuff in later, it gives people a better appreciation for things they probably wouldn't have if implemented prior. A little this Xpac a little that... in the end who cares. And if you are all &quot;GRRRRR... it's all end game or nothing&quot; then you are missing out on a great deal of the game and what it has to offer. Look beyond the crap to be killed, the loot and what's in it for you and you might find the enjoyment in the little shit like this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danielsjt</div><div class="date">2008-07-17, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While some may maintain it's unnecessary and unfitting to an MMO, I believe it's a nice addition. Worst case, you ignore it and go about your regular playtime activities; Best case, someone likes it and it adds to their enjoyment in the game world. <br />
<br />
It seems to be quite optional, and should add some flavor to the game -- I'm kind of interested at how much lore they may tie into some of them.</div></div><hr />

I've tried The Sims but it takes way too much time to build a house. I literally broke down into tears when I saw that i had to add every piece of furniture, paint the walls, and give every floor carpet. Why are games these days only catering to the hardcore players!</div></div><hr />

Actually, I see it as a nice for people to saw &quot;Hey, look, I've already cleared this instance&quot; when going to apply for a new guild. He may not have had gear from some of the last bosses, but he'll have proof attached to his account that he has indeed cleared it.<br />

Guilds already filter people out by certain requirements. This doesn't really change much.</div></div><hr />

but 1 question i have is..what about past pre-tbc/ tbc achievements? i've done mc, bwl, aq40, and naxx back then... not fair that i can't get a &quot;WoW Vet&quot; achievement&lt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

I'm just not sure how you would strip this down and rebuild it... it's a very basic concept, and now with the xpac it will be in WoW. Who cares if it's taken from x, y and z game; I'm playing WoW.<br />

Also it's good that it won't do anything bad to anybody. Yes, nolifers, stop arguing! And, *cough* get a life *cough* let people have fun! These achievements dont do ANYTHING bad for your gametime.

Either way very good idea and will be a good way to really judge what people are capable of as far as boss fights. Sure gear can tell you some, but some times you have downed Illidan 10 times but have just been VERY unlucky on drops. At least this way there is now more tanking someone's word for what instances they have completed. Plus, it is just fun, it is good to have things from time to time that really me nothing in the long run, .. after all this game means nothing in the long run of life and yet here we are pouring our time into it. .. ahhh.. the joys of life!</div></div><hr />

if this really gets tied into armory... i think it can also have negative effects on players views about each other.<br />

Imagine all those armory flames, which are very common these days, taken to a new level when now everybody can see, in which instances you've been (or not been), which boss you've downed (or not downed).<br />
<br />
I'm usually not the paranoid type, but when i get judged by others i want it to be for my social skills, not for me being unlucky to have not been to some certain instances in the past which i couldn't participate for different reasons.</div></div><hr />

Develop a system to record personal achievements. Later add in a guild hall and it can pull from the characters histories what bosses have been killed etc. Not sure why people get upset about Blizzard adding even more stuff to the game. If we didn't have it these same complainers would whine that WoW doesn't have it. Not really seeing how this would have taken that much developer time also as they already seem to record all this data, they just seem to be making it more accesible to players.<br />
<br />
What I would like to know is if there are some achievements I might want to go back and get while I still can. Never killed Kelthuzad in Naxx. Maybe I should go back and get it done is all that keeps going through my head.</div></div><hr />

you do know that since the day WoW launched on their website for the longest time they had seige weapons as something they wanted to add to the game but never got around to it until now.<br />

I definitely think it's about time for this kind of system to be introduced... So we have a way to back up what we say what we can do... Gives us credit and a way to show what we say we can do in the game... And it adds a new element to the game in the form of more goals to achieve... Not only just raiding dungeons and PvP'ing... Not just guild wide achievements... But personal goals as well... It make it more of a multi-level game play experience... Thank you, Blizzard...</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I know they only said &quot;retroactively&quot; in relation to the Feats of Strength. And those are all easily awarded as they involve stuff in your bank (like vanity pets) or reputation. <br />
<br />
Awarding all the normal achievements (like, say, having killed Ragnaros with a partical char) would mean admitting they must have been keeping records of everything you've ever done in the game. Which I don't believe they do. And if they do, they probably won't admit it due to privacy issues and such I guess...</div></div><hr />
