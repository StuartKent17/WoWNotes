Frost Death Knight in 7.3<br />
We're definitely walking an unusual line with a talent that on its face does damage, but is on a &quot;utility row.&quot; The goal would be that you can't use it to gain damage in non-movement situations (and we may have to tweak the timing or other aspects of exactly how it works in order to do that).<br />
<br />
And on a fight where you are forced to sometimes be off-target (which is common), Inexorable Assault would add damage, to be sure--but so does essentially every movement talent on any spec. The fact that it has a place in your damage meter breakdown is unusual but is a bit of a red herring. It's still merely recouping some damage that you'd otherwise have lost, no differently from a talent that lets you get back to the boss more quickly.

Tier 21 Outlaw 4pc Bonus<br />
I think there may be some misunderstanding with what the set bonus does. <br />
<br />
When you Run Through, sometimes you get a buff on yourself that makes the next time you use Roll the Bones grant you one additional buff on top of whatever it already would have given you. <br />
<br />
It does not give you a 25% chance per buff you did not get from Roll the Bones to get that buff.<br />
<br />
If you choose Slice and Dice as a talent, you get a bonus to attack speed. The tooltip should change dynamically if you pick that talent.<br />
<br />
With the 2 piece bonus:<br />
Run Through procs a buff on yourself that gives you +1 bonus buff from your next Roll the Bones. You press Roll the Bones and happen to get 1 buff (base) +1 buff (set bonus) for a total of 2. Your set bonus buff has now gone away. If you press Roll the Bones again because you didn't get your favorite two buffs, those two buffs go away, and you may get 1 buff, or 2, or 5 on your next press. You have lost the 1 bonus buff from the 2-piece until Run Through procs for you again.<br />
<br />
Maybe I misunderstood what is being discussed here.<br />
<br />
Are you saying that for some reason when you get the set bonus to proc, and then use Roll the Bones, that for some reason you may want to immediately press Roll the Bones again if the buffs you gain aren't the ideal combinations?<br />
<br />
Or are you saying that when the set bonus procs, you immediately want to use Roll the Bones as soon as you can? Is the concern that you potentially overwrite the set bonus buff or that the set bonus will fade before you Roll the Bones again? <br />
<br />
Also it should work just fine with the Loaded Dice trait. If Loaded Dice and the set bonus are both lined up to happen, you should get 3 buffs guaranteed.

<br />
One of the worst they've done honestly it looks stupid.<br />
<br />
good to see you don't know what a reskin is.</div></div><hr />

Great class, easy to use, difficult to master. Iconic class, if you will. Now, I read these posts from the devs about what they did to the class, and the RNG they threw into the rotation...you need a fucking spreadsheet to play a combat rogue.<br />
<br />
I really fucking hate Celestalon and his team. They fucked up things that should have been left alone. I can't imagine going back into this game, with what they did to rogues.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather a store mount. I can get a store mount with a mouse click. I can't geta single paragon mount to drop. RNG mounts are fail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That being said, I'm disappointed to see that it just uses the same /mountspecial animation as the Imperial Quilen mount along with the skeleton animations... They could've done something truly unique for the mountspecial effect and sound!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is so ugly and disturbing that I want to ride it.</div></div><hr />

I mean... to me that's just a good job doing something difficult.</div></div><hr />

Blood DKs could do it. But if you look closely, it took the dude 12+ hours to do just that one dungeon (plus all the timelapse, etc). It's not like he went in and solo'd it in an hour or something. Not saying it's not impressive, most people could do that if they really wanted to, it's just time consuming.</div></div><hr />

Paragon cache according to an earlier post I made. Not confirmed though.</div></div><hr />

Subjective, it's good they did something a bit out of the box. We ave really got all we could of of the &quot;horse-esque&quot; and &quot;dragon-esque&quot; mounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's about the FinalBoss TV video, not the DH one. You know, the one titled &quot;Protection Paladins&quot;...<br />

IT was a Veng DH doing it. But hey you are a shining example of this Forums problem with Idiots not even looking at something properly before complaining about it.<br />
<br />
It was about the Protection Paladin video at the bottom, not the one and only things you notice with the DH one. Talk about &quot;idiots not looking at something properly before complaining about it&quot;.</div></div><hr />
