Mount and Pet Dressing Room - Battle for Azeroth<br />
In Battle for Azeroth, if someone links a mount or pet in chat, you can now Ctrl + click it to preview it in the dressing room window, similar to the current functionality for armor and weapons. <br />

<br />
It originally was shown as a reskinned CE/Deluxe raptor. I guess they removed the saddle and went without it to make it more unique.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure if it's maybe a mod but at least for mounts it already works on live. Not sure how long, because I was surprised as well when I found out recently. I was telling a friend about the change when I noticed it's already there. Not for pets though.</div></div><hr />

You act as though we've never gotten new mounts with an expansion before.</div></div><hr />

Currently, it's bugged.<br />
The actual CE mount itself is also lacking its armor.</div></div><hr />

Yep, only mounts and allied races, literally nothing else to BfA than that.<br />

That made my motion sickness even worse than the current WoW raptor animations... <br />
<br />
Very funny to see GW2 mounts being embraced though when I remember so well how I was attacked for wanting the game to have them when GW2 first came out. :D<br />

Raptors have new run animations in BfA, so hopefully they'll extend it to our mounts as well. The bouncy type running that raptor/Raven Lord mounts have is tiresome to say the least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm still irritated that they removed the ability to mount up on both CE mounts. The Raptor looks at least 10x cooler than the stupid horse.</div></div><hr />

This is what the mount actually looks like, I don't know why MMO champ chose the one patch that has both the deluxe mount and this one bugged to show off the mount, but both of them still have their armor.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it seems to be applied to all raptor models, from the level 20 and 40 troll mounts, to the CE ones.<br />
Also wild ones, like the vanilla raptor model, the TBC one, the WoD one, the falcosaur and the BfA ravasaur.<br />
Check it out on WoWhead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a recolor of the BFA Raptor mount.... for some reason parts of the armor aren't showing up in that preview, or on the beta ATM, but they were showing up initially.</div></div><hr />
