And we finally have the last class preview of the day! Tomorrow we will have the previews of the http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior, http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight, and http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue classes. The amount of posts on the front page has been increased to 8 to make the browsing slightly less painful this week, but I'll eventually figure out something more convenient to post everything. <br />
In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, we'll be making lots of changes and additions to class talents and abilities across the board. In this preview, you'll get an early look at some of the changes in store for the priest class, including a rundown of some of the new spells, abilities, and talents, as well as an overview of how the new Mastery system will work with the different talent specs.<br />
<br />
New Priest Spells<br />
<br />
Heal (available at level 16): While priests already have a spell called Heal, the existing version becomes obsolete at higher levels, which is something we intend to change in Cataclysm. Introduced at a low level, the &quot;new&quot; Heal spell will functionally work much like a down-ranked Greater Heal did in the past, adding more granularity to your direct-healing arsenal. If you need to heal someone a moderate amount and efficiency is an issue (making Flash Heal the incorrect spell for the job), then Heal is what you want to use. Heal is intended to be the priest's go-to direct-healing spell unless they need something bigger (Greater Heal) or faster (Flash Heal). We will be following a similar philosophy with all the healing classes.<br />
<br />
Mind Spike (level 81): Deals Shadowfrost damage and puts a debuff on the target that improves subsequent Mind Spike damage. The intent of Mind Spike is to fill a niche missing in Shadow DPS, though it may be occasionally useful for healers as well. Mind Spike provides a quick nuke to use in situations where the priest doesn't have time to set up the normal rotation, such as when adds are dying too fast or you have to swap targets a lot. Spamming Mind Spike will do about as much damage as casting Mind Flay on a target afflicted with Shadow Word: Pain. The idea behind the debuff is that when you cast Mind Spike, we expect you to cast a lot of them; we don't intend you to fit it into an already full Shadow rotation. It also provides Shadow with a spell to cast when locked out of the Shadow school. (School lockouts will no longer affect both schools for multi-school spells.) 1.5-second cast. 30-yard range. No cooldown.<br />
<br />
Inner Will (level 83): Increases movement speed by 12% and reduces the mana cost of instant-cast spells by 10%. This buff will be exclusive with Inner Fire, meaning you can't have both up at once. Inner Fire provides a spell power and Armor buff; Inner Will should be useful on a more situational basis.<br />
<br />
Leap of Faith (level 85): Pull a party or raid member to your location. Leap of Faith (or &quot;Life Grip&quot;) is intended to give priests a tool to help rescue fellow players who have pulled aggro, are being focused on in PvP, or just can't seem to get out of the fire in time. Instant. 30-yard range. 45-second cooldown.<br />
<br />
Changes to Abilities and Mechanics<br />
<br />
In addition to introducing new spells, we're planning to make changes to some of the other abilities and mechanics you're familiar with. This list and the summary of talent changes below it are by no means comprehensive, but they should give you a good sense of what we intend for each spec.<br />
<br />
All HoTs and DoTs will benefit from Haste and Crit innately. Hasted HoTs and DoTs will not have a shorter duration, just a shorter period in between ticks (meaning they will gain extra ticks to fill in the duration as appropriate).<br />
<br />
We want to bring back Shadow Word: Death as an &quot;execute&quot; -- something you do when the target is at 25% health.<br />
<br />
While we want to keep the priest's role as a well-rounded healer, we also want to make sure the class is a viable tank healer, which is something priests moved away from a little in Wrath of the Lich King. Greater Heal will probably be the tank-healing spell of choice, though we've also discussed giving Discipline a second shield so that they have a small shield to cast on lots of different targets, and a big, more expensive shield to cast on a tank or anyone else taking a ton of damage.<br />
<br />
Divine Spirit and Prayer of Spirit will be removed from the game. As Spirit will be the primary mana-regeneration stat, we don't want it to vary as much between solo, small group, and raid play. Blessing of Kings and Mark of the Wild will not boost Spirit either.<br />
<br />
Mana will be a bigger consideration for all healers. We aren't trying to make healing more painful; we're trying to make it more fun. When the cost of a spell isn't an issue, then casting the right spell for the job is less of an issue because you might as well just use your most powerful spell all of the time. We are, however, getting rid of the five-second rule, because we don't want to encourage standing around doing nothing. We're also going to cut back on the benefits of buffs such as Replenishment so priests (and all healers) don't feel as penalized when those buffs aren't available.<br />
<br />
New Talents and Talent Changes<br />
<br />
We want to improve Discipline's single-target healing capacity. One key is to make sure shielding isn't always a more attractive option than healing.<br />
<br />
We want to improve Holy for PvP healing. One way to do this is to make sure that Heal's throughput is similar between both specs.<br />
<br />
We want to improve Shadow for short fights and reduce its susceptibility to school lockouts.<br />
<br />
Discipline will finally be getting Power Word: Barrier as a talented ability. Think of it like a group Power Word: Shield.<br />
<br />
We want to make Holy a little bit more interesting to play. One new talent will push the Holy priest into an improved healing state when he or she casts Prayer of Healing, Heal, or Renew three times in a row. The empowered state varies depending on the heals cast.<br />
<br />
Since the Shadow tree has a lot of passive damage-boosting abilities -- something we're trying to avoid in Cataclysm -- we will need to replace several of the tree's talents. One idea is to play off of the new Shadow Orbs mechanic (see Mastery section below), possibly allowing you to consume an orb to increase damage from Mind Blast or reduce Mind Spike's cast time.<br />
<br />
Misery will no longer affect spell Hit chance. We want players to be able to gear themselves around a Hit cap that isn't variable depending on group composition.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery Passive Talent Tree Bonuses<br />
<br />
Discipline<br />
Healing<br />
Meditation<br />
Absorption<br />
<br />
Absorption: Improves the strength of shields such as Power Word: Shield, Divine Aegis, and Power Word: Barrier.<br />
<br />
Holy<br />
Healing<br />
Meditation<br />
Radiance<br />
<br />
Radiance: Your direct heals add a small heal-over-time component to the target.<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
Spell damage<br />
Spell Crit<br />
Shadow Orbs<br />
<br />
Shadow Orbs: Casting spells grants a chance for Shadow Orbs to be created that fly around you and increase your shadow damage. This will help lower-level characters feel more like &quot;Shadow priests&quot; before they obtain Shadowform.<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoyed this preview, and we're looking forward to hearing your initial thoughts and feedback on these additions and changes. Please keep in mind that this information represents a work in progress and is subject to change as development on Cataclysm continues.<br />
<br />
[...] <br />
<br />
A few quick clarifications:<br />
<br />
Neither Inner Fire nor Inner Will has charges. The decision is on which armor you want up at the time.<br />
<br />
Preventing dot clipping is something we want to do in general. It obviously benefits Shadow priests just as much as warlocks.<br />
<br />
The idea behind Mind Spike is that you can't always settle into your normal, and high-ramp up rotation. It's also useful when you have to move or get school locked.<br />
<br />
The closest analogue to PW:B is the DK Anti-Magic Zone, but it has some important differences, such as a way to counter it in PvP (since it absorbs all damage, not just magical damage).<br />
<br />
The idea behind the Holy &quot;cast three in a row&quot; talent (it's called &quot;Chakra&quot;) is that we've always positioned Holy as a versatile healer. This talent lets you shift into different modes. If you need to be a tank healer, cast three single target heals and your single-target healing is now better. Cast three area heals, and you can be a temporarily specialized group healer. We're going to try to play this mechanic up with a cool UI to try to get that &quot;I'm almost in the zone&quot; feel. We'll let it apply to as many types of spells as we can, perhaps even Smite for those times when nobody's taking damage.<br />
<br />
We pulled Misery because we are pulling every group benefit that improves hit. It's annoying to have to swap your gear in and out depending on who shows up for your group. In general we're going to push even harder in Cataclysm for bringing people you like to play with, not bringing people who have awesome buffs. The answer to almost every question of &quot;But why would they bring me?&quot; should be &quot;Because you know what the hell you're doing.&quot;</div></div><hr />

SUPER excited that PW:Barrier is making a return.<br />
Sounds like Blizz is trying to implement a psuedo-Holyform... I like it!<br />
Shadow orbs sounds really cool too. Might have to dual-spec into Shadow...<br />
<br />
I'm also completely confused by Inner Will. I'm finding it hard to imagine many PvE situations where a Disc priest would choose Inner Fire over Inner Focus... Reduced cost of PoM, Penance, PW:S, PW:B (presumably) + Movement Speed increase is probably going to be more beneficial in almost all cases except for static fights when the Priest has NO risk of going OOM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please keep Shadow fun and effective in PvP. Either add even more exceptions to Shadowform's Limitations, keep on making interesting Discipline Spells, or make Shadowform only prevent heals. You have made it clear that we aren't Elemental Shamans, and need to be penalized when we switch from damaging to healing, just don't make us unable to compete.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wadark</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This actually has some nice implications for other DPS as well. Misery/Imp. Fairy Fire are a bit of an annoyance for hit capping because if you don't have one, you might be below hit cap which = bad. But if you gear assuming you don't have one, and you DO have one show up, suddenly it seems a bit wasted.<br />
<br />
The way gear works now, it's hard to very accurately gear for hit. But with reforging, it'll be easier to get hit to that kind of accuracy, and it will be nice to not have to stress over group comp in the gearing process.</div></div><hr />

High end gear will have the mastery stats, yes. However, you still get a certain amount of mastery bonus for each talent spent in the tree you are mastering (IE: have the most points in).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure that Inner Fire/Focus change is going to have pvp priests excited about being hamstring/whatever chained; it's only 4% better movement than an enchant.<br />
<br />
Also, All HoTs and DoTs will benefit from Haste and Crit innately. Hasted HoTs and DoTs will not have a shorter duration, just a shorter period in between ticks (meaning they will gain extra ticks to fill in the duration as appropriate).<br />
<br />
is much better wording than the notes for warlocks.</div></div><hr />

Sad that Shadow Priests have no ground breaking changes though. The Mind Spike looks like it will be VERY situational.<br />
<br />
They're basically going to be gutting the spriest talent tree, because it's so full of 'boring passive talents,' so spriests will probably see a lot of changes in the beta.</div></div><hr />

Edit: To everyone QQing about priests misusing it, how often do you wipe because a paladin misuses their bubble or DIs a healer during the fight? This isn't going to ruin the DF tool either anymore than the healer just leaving the party like they can do now. There will be people who abuse it at first to be funny but it will end up as a very effective tool in both PvE and PvP.</div></div><hr />

I'm kind off mixed about this subject. Specially on the removal/reduction they plan with Replenishment effects. To me, the importantcy of receiving benefits while playing in groups outweights their argument to why to put limitations on it.<br />

And for those getting QQy about Life Grip, it will probably require you to be in the same group or raid, so you cant use it on random people, and will probably require other things to limit its abuse. Yes it will still be abused, but hopefully not to much. I want to see it get to release.<br />
<br />
Though I know if it does, I am going to put it on a bar, far away from my other abilities, and not keybind it, jsut so i don't accidentally hit it.<br />

Since you can only life grip party members, it's not going to be like a priest can just jump off the cliff in Arathi, life grip an enemy and levitate while they fall and crash on the ground.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Life grip CAN be used to grief a lot of players thou, and one can not do anything to prevent it, or smack the griefer back. A limitation should be made so one gotta sign up for accepting the help. Like being in the same party or raid at least so one can choose not to be gripped by morons.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daegalus</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few quick clarifications: <br />
<br />
Neither Inner Fire nor Inner Will has charges. The decision is on which armor you want up at the time. <br />
<br />
Preventing dot clipping is something we want to do in general. It obviously benefits Shadow priests just as much as warlocks. <br />
<br />
The idea behind Mind Spike is that you can't always settle into your normal, and high-ramp up rotation. It's also useful when you have to move or get school locked. <br />
<br />
The closest analogue to PW:B is the DK Anti-Magic Zone, but it has some important differences, such as a way to counter it in PvP (since it absorbs all damage, not just magical damage). <br />
<br />
The idea behind the Holy &quot;cast three in a row&quot; talent (it's called &quot;Chakra&quot;) is that we've always positioned Holy as a versatile healer. This talent lets you shift into different modes. If you need to be a tank healer, cast three single target heals and your single-target healing is now better. Cast three area heals, and you can be a temporarily specialized group healer. We're going to try to play this mechanic up with a cool UI to try to get that &quot;I'm almost in the zone&quot; feel. We'll let it apply to as many types of spells as we can, perhaps even Smite for those times when nobody's taking damage. <br />
<br />
We pulled Misery because we are pulling every group benefit that improves hit. It's annoying to have to swap your gear in and out depending on who shows up for your group. In general we're going to push even harder in Cataclysm for bringing people you like to play with, not bringing people who have awesome buffs. The answer to almost every question of &quot;But why would they bring me?&quot; should be &quot;Because you know what the hell you're doing.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I was expecting some new heal, but I guess it's not needed. Honestly though, I've never felt like my priest's AoE healing to be anywhere near good?<br />
Prayer of Healing feels slow as hell and Circle of Healing has a quite long cooldown. But whatever, since I'm not doing HM25 Lich King I'm not allowed to speak.<br />
<br />
The improved healing state, aw.. give us Holy Form :p<br />
<br />
Oh and, if any DPS promply bashes me for not Life Griping HIM out of danger, I'd stop healing him alltogether.<br />

Shadow changes seem nice.<br />
As they pointed out, Shadow lacks in short fights, so I could've expected something like Devouring Plague (since it can only be active once at a time) dealing some AoE on tick, but meh.<br />

I never thought they would make heal viable again but I'm glad they did.<br />
I am also glad shadow priests got a nuke, they needed it as it takes them way longer then other casters to build up damage.<br />
The new empowered state after casting 3 of the same heals also sounds interesting and i can't wait for more information about this.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that it opens an opportunity for a class to kill another class who is in the same faction, while the victim cannot do anything in response to it (mainly fight back)</div></div><hr />

<br />
to see pw:b come back- nice.<br />
<br />
to have different shields is nice... bigger smaller and a &quot;normal&quot; one, if this goes live- nice<br />
<br />
life grip.... hm well... we will see ... sounds pretty fun, but blizz WILL change something on that. as it is now it wont go through the beta... it just cant... i just cant imagine to be able to grip a friend out of combat to me or somethin like this.... death grip is pain, life grip will be the same... <br />
<br />
for me <br />
We want to make Holy a little bit more interesting to play. One new talent will push the Holy priest into an improved healing state when he or she casts Prayer of Healing, Heal, or Renew three times in a row. The empowered state varies depending on the heals cast. sounds pretty cool, this would make the whole holy tree more funny and not that boring, as holy is atm in raids.<br />
radiance seems to be a step towards mobility as a holy priest aswell... <br />
<br />
inner fire and inner will... hm... sounds damn nice, one of the things which will to 100% raise the skillcap of all priests<br />
<br />
all in all im happy with the healing-priest changes which are upcomming... not &quot;too happy&quot; just &quot;happy&quot;... could have been much worse tbh<br />
<br />
the shadow preview is just meeeh... nothing game breaking... i want to see the shadow talent tree first before i could say anything bout the changes in cata... beta will be very interesting</div></div><hr />

You can't grip someone when you are in midair. Can't be done. Not allowed.<br />
<br />
You can only grip people in the same party or raid. If you think it will be hilarious to grip the tank into a huge pack of fire or whatever, good luck ever getting invited back.<br />
<br />
Even if you gripped another party member out of combat for no reason. Then what? It's not like you can hurt them, you've just caused them mild inconvenience.<br />

Leap of Faith is a cool spell. Deal with it nerds.<br />

<br />
Leap of Faith is really cool. I see it being useful on many fights in ICC. Marrowgar to get people out of fire, Deathwhisper to pull a lagging melee to adds or someone out of DnD, Gunship to pull someone off the enemy ship?, Saurfang to get a failing kiter away from a beast, and the list goes on from there.<br />
<br />
To the PvE qq, if you don't want griefing priests in your raid, don't pug. Join a guild that raids with smart and skilled players. Problem solved.</div></div><hr />

Well, since they are going to rebuild the shadow talent tree i'm not going to QQ a lot, just a little bit.<br />
What the SP gets: Mind Spike lvl 81. just LAME:<br />
&quot;Spamming Mind Spike will do about as much damage as casting Mind Flay on a target afflicted with Shadow Word: Pain.&quot; <br />
With 1.5 secs cast, way faster than Mind Flay, ther SP is loosing his ultra-cool-facemelter in favor of Mind Spike (can't see a reason to use Mind Flay now, except for the porpouse of renewing SW:P on target) .<br />
Shadow Orbs: Cool-looking, we'll see how they play out, a SP in shadowform with 5 orbs around him will look goooooood.<br />
Misery goes : Alright Blizzard, better increase our DPS or else... who will want a SP in their raid setup?, with all our support abilities already in other classes...<br />
SW: Death : Coming back as an Execute. Not a bad idea, since now SW:D is just a filler or something you cast while running, changes to the mecanics must be done if its going to be an execute, meaning it will cause a lot of DMG to a target below 25% they better remove the part where the SP takes all the freaking damage done to the target if it does not die, right now I can´t imagine taking let's say 10k damage every 12 secs (assuming they increase the damage it does).<br />

<br />
And comparing the responses from priest and shamans , its like totally opposed. At the shaman changes only cheers and omg happy people , but for priest <br />
not that &quot;zomg&quot; ... but people jump on the hate train for an interestting spell , not that ground braking , but good to have in situational moments and totally ignoring the <br />
other mediocre shit they get.<br />
<br />
Altho its only a preview and i think its only a small part of the changes that are being made , so we might get more info as beta/cata release day approaches.<br />
But I can't shake the feeling that things won't go so well for the priests , mainly for shadow priests...</div></div><hr />

I know how you feel, didn't they do this once before in BC? Tried changing the mana issues and made it so bad a lot of healers quit? All I know is, if I have to worry about going oom again, I'll just go back to solid DPS. At least my hunter won't have to worry about that utter BS. She will just have a crazy orange &quot;energy&quot; bar.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miggy</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a melee dps, the thought of life grip is somewhat worrying - i'm perfectly capable of avoiding fire and whatnot, I really don't want another class making the decisions for me and yanking me 40+ yards away from the boss and me having to spend ages running back.<br />
<br />
Also, not everyone had in depth knowledge of each and every class - for example if we are struggling on dps for a fight, I might decide to stay in an aoe but pop shamanistic rage to keep me alive through it - the priest healer might not realise what i'm doing and grip me away to avoid the aoe, thinking he's helping but he's not.<br />
<br />
I think its definately more of a pvp skill to help out your team mates if in trouble, but for pve its got more potential to mess things up than help imo.</div></div><hr />

Leap of Faith (or &quot;Life Grip&quot;) is intended to give priests a tool to help rescue fellow players who have pulled aggro, are being focused on in PvP, or just can't seem to get out of the fire in time. Instant. 30-yard range. 45-second cooldown.<br />
Am I the only one who thought of Assassin's Creed when I read the name of this spell?<br />
<br />
I like these changes, and I can see a lot of uses (both funny and cruel) for this Leap of Faith spell. Jumping over some edge, and then LoFing some ally just to see him/her go &quot;splat&quot; while I levitate. It's going to be so much fun :D<br />
Because of the changes to Shadow Priests I may even change one of my specs to shadow again, but I think I'll have to wait and see before deciding anything.<br />
<br />
But I will most definitively be keeping my disc spec:<br />
Discipline will finally be getting Power Word: Barrier as a talented ability. Think of it like a group Power Word: Shield.This sounds sooo cool :D</div></div><hr />

I feel this is quite wierd.. Do you think it's fun having healers spaming their biggest heals for a entier encounter without actually looking at their mana? :q They're making sure you can't just spam the biggest and fastest heal you have in your spell book, you actually got to THINK before you heal since in a huge part of wotlk some healers have not had to pay attention to their mana bar which is wrong imo and removes what should be an extra concern for the healer.</div></div><hr />

Also I don't understand Shadow Orbs, increased Mastery on gear increases the effect or number of Shadow Orbs around Shadow Priests which in turn increase shadow damage dealt, wait isn't this the same as Mastery #1: Spell Damage???</div></div><hr />

Does anyone imagine that Leap of Faith will ever make it out of beta? At least they limited it to group or raid members, but even at that I see this as nothing but trouble. A quick read of the comments regarding it here will confirm the potential headaches. Between this, and Blizz's outrageous, and completely unprecedented, highjacking of the blood dk dps tree for tanking only, Blizz has proven once again that they are often just flailing around in the dark, with little concern regarding their own traditions or broken promises. <br />
<br />
Dammit don't dangle the carrot unless there's a chance that we can get to it: in the case of Leap of Faith, it will never see the light of day in the finalized expansion, not as currently described at least. Unless Blizz is even more incompetent than I sometimes consider them to be.</div></div><hr />

I might have to try out Holy, looking at those changes, Chakra seems pretty awesome...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What the SP gets: Mind Spike lvl 81. just LAME:<br />
&quot;Spamming Mind Spike will do about as much damage as casting Mind Flay on a target afflicted with Shadow Word: Pain.&quot; <br />
With 1.5 secs cast, way faster than Mind Flay, ther SP is loosing his ultra-cool-facemelter in favor of Mind Spike (can't see a reason to use Mind Flay now<br />
<br />
I would imagine it will cost more mana than Mind Flay. We'll have to cast/stack the debuff from Mind Spike before it does the same damage as Mind Flay.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wouldn't Life Gripping a tank generally be bad?<br />
<br />
I don't think it's designed to be used on the tank, though it could be good for those Arcane Explosion type bosses. I imagine it would lower the targets threat, letting the tank drop an AoE down to grab them all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had to smile about &quot;life Grip - for those who just can't seem to get out of fire.&quot; I already have dps saying, &quot;why didn't you heal me.&quot; I say, &quot;you were standing in fire for over a minute, I can't heal stupid.&quot; Now we will have dps saying, &quot;why didn't you pull me out of the fire?&quot;<br />
<br />
Think about WSG were once people figure out the spaceing, they can do premade teams of a gobin mage runner uses his racial/blink abilities to jump to friendly team mates, while priests life grip him when his speed boast cooldowns are not up. We can have some very fast WSG flag caps with this.<br />
<br />
PS. when I tried to post this thread was on page 8!<br />
I do like the idea that all our schools are not linked to counter spells. I hated running low level instances for achivments, only to be counter spelled by a mob 20 levels lower than me, and find that when my holy spell was CS that my disco spells are also locked out. I duel spec to shadow and when my shadow spells are CS then my disco spells are locked out as well. As a Draenei I felt bad that if my holy spells were CS then my racial is also locked out... that just felt wrong.<br />
<br />
They really are going to have to change racials around if they are changing hit so it is not dependant on group comps. No more &quot;have to bring a Draenei so we can be hit capped.&quot; If they keep the Draenei's 'heals for less than herbalism's heal over time' racial then I sure hope they finally allow us to use our racial in shadow form!<br />
<br />
As far as them saying that they want to equalize holy and disco's thoughtput... I prefer the positioning of one being an amazing raid healer, and one being an amazing single target healer. I don't care which is which, but since priests are the only class with two schools of healing, and in a raid there are two types of healers, I would prefer that distinction. <br />
<br />
I had to smile that they are removing the spirit buff that priests bring, in BC it was a talent that was in the disco tree. When BC was ending, and we got WOTLK talents, and all bosses were nerfed to the ground, my guild did Kara to try everything out. I chose not to spec into that spirit buff, and got kicked out of the guild because of that choice... now they are removing it completely.<br />
<br />
I got really excited when I saw that Shamans got an ablility to cast spells while moving, but got disappointed priests didn't get something similar. Shamans also got a great AOE healing spell, healing rain, I hate them for taking my raid spots... Heroism+fear totems+these changes... no wonder so many priests want to grief with Leap of Faith!<br />
<br />
I thought it strange that they are saying the shadow orbs are for low levels to feel more like shadow priests before getting shadow form. I thought this game was balanced around end game, not for low levels to feel good about themselves. <br />
<br />
The both &quot;inner&quot; buffs are in two parts (SP+armor) and (reduced mana+movement), so a PVE and a PVP component. I hope they are off the GCD so you can change quickly.</div></div><hr />

Exactly... CONCERN... an anxious feeling... Not fun... Don't get me wrong, I don't want endless mana and I do pay attention to my mana, but worrying about mana is not a good direction if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

The shadow changes seem pretty underwhelming though. Shadow priests have long been the red headed step child of WoW. Pretty much the only thing that secured us a raiding spot was the buffs we brought. In Classic we were all but unheard of at end game. In BC we were mana batteries. Then in WoTLK, several classes could do it. So Misery then became our trump. And while I can understand that gearing around hit is a pain for other classes, the 3% extra hit is just about the only thing we've got left at this point. It terms of DPS output we take a while to ramp up. In a flat out burn between two comparibly skilled and geared players - one a spriest and one a pure DPS - the biggest majority of the time the pure DPS is going to come out ahead. If Misery is going away and Replenishment isn't a factor, I can't really see a good raid guild having much of an incentive to bring a spriest along when there are other classes that can do what we do so much better. At this point I can only hope that the shadowy balls of goodness actually bring us a competitive edge. And maybe the talent tree will be loaded with super awesomeness. Maybe . . .</div></div><hr />

couldnt the priest, (as long as the tank has a nice amount of threat)<br />
pull the tank out of the way of a bosses big hits?<br />

(Tank could then range taunt the boss to make sure its still on him)<br />
<br />
and again, if the boss has no cleave attack, the boss would then have to run over to said tank and carry on his attacking, all the while the dps (in particular Tott rogues and MD hunters) can carry on dpsing the boss, while the tank takes no damage?<br />

So, if we know a big hit is coming to the tank, we can 'dodge' it by moving the tank out of melee range from the boss?<br />
<br />
This would make quite a few bosses quite trivial would it not??</div></div><hr />

If a big hit is coming we'll use Guardian Spirit, could be too risky to leap the tank.</div></div><hr />

Life grip will be pretty awesome. (And no it won't be overly abused, unless people in your raids DI/BoP the tank constantly or MD/TotT the healers.) I see it as something awesome for battlegrounds and arena.<br />

Leap of Faith looks to be more pvp oriented. It seems rather blah for pve with the potential to annoy raid members. The same way tanks despised knockbacks, players probably aren't going to like being interrupted and have abrupt shifts in movement (a healer could be pulled out of range of a target, etc). I am interested in what's in store for Holy. Being able to go into an improved single target or aoe healing mode could be fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, this may seem like nitpicking to some, but why are Priests getting a spell that deals frost damage? Every class has always had its damage types set in stone and has never broken that mold; to do so now, and to have just one single spell that deals a different type of damage than everything else in your arsenal just seems off to me. If they really wanted to give Priests a dual-type spell, then it should have been consistent with its current damage types. Give them a shadow/holy damage spell, and simply make it castable in Shadowform.</div></div><hr />

Also this. So much this.<br />

They said one numerous occasions that they will have to tweak EVERY SINGLE ability, every rank, every talent, every rating to the new system. So of course healing spells will be tweaked. We alreaddy have a lot of awesome heals, they just don't have the throughput that other healing classes have right now. That's a problem of numbers though, not a problem of design.</div></div><hr />

Death Grip can't be cast while moving. Falling counts as moving. That's why you can't Death Grip that damn Shaman the booms everyone off the bridge at the top of AV. There's no justification in making Leap of Faith different.</div></div><hr />

Imagine a priest standing next you on a cliff , bam he jumps of with levitate , tries to cast Grip....but but... it doesnt work cause your not in his grp!?! WHAT THE HELL!?<br />
Next scenario , he invites you before he does that ! Jumps off with levitate , tries to cast Grip .. but .. but. IT STILL DOESNT WORK YOU DIMWITT!<br />
<br />
Seriously this is like the 100th post of this kind...and people keep say &quot;IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY!!&quot; , is it that hard to read what other people are saying ?<br />
Fact : It doesn't work to grip some1 in the air!<br />
Fact : To be able to use the spell you need to be in the group/raid with him!<br />
Fact : Its not that great of a spell , yeah it can be fun but... how long will that &quot;fun&quot; lasts? few weeks tops . Realize that its a situational spell in Pve.. <br />
Oh nooo , the priest gripped me!! now i have to walk all the way back to the boss damnit !! *You hear on vent* STOP STANDING IN THE THAT DAMN FIRE !<br />
<br />
Fact : People who abuse this to have fun in a progress raid , suck at this game big time and wont get invited ever again...<br />
<br />
Priest goes &quot;HA! In your face! i can do w/e i want and wipe the raid!<br />
Raid Leader then proceed with &quot;/ignore&quot; &quot;/kick&quot; and good riddents! And maybe issue a small warning to other people &quot;careful with &quot;x&quot; he is a douch&quot;<br />

Not a fact. This is entirely dependent on the guild, the raid, the raid leader and the gripped target.<br />
<br />
If the target happens to be someone who has had a few lag spikes recently then life gripping could save them, for example.<br />
<br />
If it's a boss with limited attempts then most people probably wouldn't use it but if you've been wiping all night on a raid boss and the raid needs some comic relief then it could help lighten the mood. A friend told me about a poor tank who got turned into a rabbit using the noblegarden item (that can be cast on group / raid members :P) just as he was pulling General Vezax. The raid wiped, the tank screamed, and most people laughed their asses off.</div></div><hr />

And while yes, it's people's own jobs to get out of the fire etc, it's still nice of you if you pull them out of it and save their ass. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. Not to mention disconnects.

Limitations like not being able to life grip a target currently with aggro from a boss will probably be implemented if this happens. I doubt many priests will do this tough, there are the occasional assholes who will abuse this tough which is sad since its such a practical spell :S</div></div><hr />
