Unholy Death Knight Feedback<br />
An upcoming PTR hotfix (unsure of timing) will increase the damage of Portal to the Underworld and proc rate of Armies of the Damned.<br />
<br />
One other set of changes is meant to help free up a little space in the rotation, or at least get back to the point where you're not frequently wasting resources due to not having enough time to spend them all. We're reducing a few effects that inject large amount of resources into the rotation (such as Pestilent Pustules) and increasing overall damage slightly. The net result is that people playing busy builds like Castigator/Pestilent Pustules/Infected Claws will likely still be using most or all of their global cooldowns on abilities, but will less often be in a state where they ignore or overcap Runic Power.

[Feedback] Marksmanship in 7.1.5<br />
An upcoming PTR hotfix will increase the proc rate of Marking Targets significantly. Our expectation is that in stationary situations, it should be straightforward to have a Vulnerable ready when you need or want to spend Focus on Aimed Shot, and the primary factor in full or near-full Aimed Shot effectiveness is good Focus management. In addition, a Vulnerable window that's ineffective due to movement, freshly spawned targets, or similar issues will be much less punishing.<br />
<br />
We are also testing a subtle change that should address one of the flow issues that's been discussed. If Marking Targets appears very shortly (a split-second) before an Arcane Shot or Multi-Shot cast, it will no longer be consumed by the cast. When you're using Arcane Shot to build focus on a target that's Marked, if Marking Targets lights up, you will more reliably be able to react and cast Marked Shot, rather than overwriting the Mark with a new one.

Micro-Holidays in Patch 7.1.5<br />
Patch 7.1.5 brings with it a variety of updates and new content. One of these new additions is what we’re calling micro-holidays. Each one is meant to make the world feel more alive without making players feel like they need to participate for big rewards—while still providing some more variety and fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Call of the Scarab - January 21-23 - To commemorate the first ringing of the Scarab Gong on January 23, 2006, players will be able to relive a portion of the Ahn’Qiraj gate opening by collecting items for turn-in. The winning faction will then be able to claim bragging rights and have their faction flag hang over the gates until the next Call of the Scarab micro-holiday event.<br />
Hatching of the Hippogryphs - February 23 - Those who head to Feralas will be able to bear witness to the yearly hatching of the hippogryphs. You may even make a little friend for the day.<br />
March of the Tadpoles - April 5 - Each year, the Winterfin murlocs allow their tadpoles free reign over their village. You can make a difference by adopting your favorite, feeding it, and protecting it from nearby predators.<br />
Volunteer Guard Day - April 28 - Step into the shoes of a guard in the major cities with a /salute and you’ll get to serve and protect the city just like them. Stay vigilant and watch out for any invaders.<br />
Spring Balloon Festival - May 10-12 - Several of Azeroth’s characters – some of whom you might recognize – are giving tours of Azeroth in their hot air balloons. You’ll enjoy their commentary and interact with other citizens as you take in the scenery.<br />
Glowcap Festival - May 27 - Head to Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh, collect some rare mushrooms, and help the sporelings heal the great mushroom, Fshoo. You’ll gain a bit of Sporeggar reputation for helping them out.<br />
Thousand Boat Bash - June 6-8 - Thousand Needles is where the biggest bash on boats can be found in Azeroth. It’s a chance to unwind a little, away from the lurking danger of the Burning Legion.<br />
Un’goro Madness - August 10-12 - Dinosaurs are running amok in Un’Goro. Help quell the rampage and you’ll be awarded some temporary evolution buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
These holidays are just the beginning and we’ll be adding more even beyond the patch so keep an eye on the calendar!<br />

Hi,has Sargeras truly become a demon (can reform in the Nether) or is he still just a titan with demonic features (horns..)?<br />
Sargeras is a titan first and foremost. #Argus knows (Alex_Afrasiabi (https://twitter.com/Alex_Afrasiabi/status/809519158681432064))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Do you think there’s a problem with the playerbase mistaking ‘optimal’ with 'viable’? This is mostly a WoW question, but I see it a lot in League too: The belief that this champion/class/spec isn’t the top of the meters or winrate lists, so they’re absolutely trash.<br />
Yes. I think there is a lot that goes into this mindset, including the human predisposition to want to blame the game instead of ourselves, and the weirdness that sometimes results when “bet the best I can possibly be” mindset inside the game gets mutated into “lobby the developers to make me better.”<br />
<br />
I have also seen players have a really unhealthy reaction to data being presented as a stack rank. When they see their name as #2 beneath a #1, they don’t always stop to analyze whether 2 and 1 are really different. They just see first place and not first place. The visual presentation of data as stacks can be problematic for this reason.<br />
<br />
But I think a lot of it comes from a philosophical difference between the following two responses:<br />
<br />
<br />
I could improve my results by 30% just by playing better, so whether or not I am statistically 2% behind another characters is largely in the noise.<br />
I could improve my results by 30% just by playing better, but every bit counts, so being even 2% behind another character is relevant.<br />

I am reasonably sure it will come before that Jan 23rd to celebrate 'Call of the Scarab' or they'd make us wait a whole year to experience this holiday which would suck</div></div><hr />

Well looking at nighthold release being the 17th and Call of the Scarab being January 21-23 which would come before the next reset after NH. 7.1.5 has to come out Jan/3 (think Jan/10 would be way to close to NH release) or with NH and mythic raids being pushed back until atleast February.<br />

I'd be happy if this was actually true. On one hand we know players will always bitch abuot something. On the other hand blizzard has never once balanced dps anywhere close. With the top and bottom specs always being radically differant. <br />

I would welcome the player base screaming about spec names if it meant dps was that close.</div></div><hr />

Sargeras is a titan first and foremost. #Argus knows (Alex_Afrasiabi)<br />
<br />
I really wonder if Afrasiabi is doing it on purpose these days.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knaak: Sargeras ceased to be in the sense of his physical being in the mortal world of Azeroth. He was cast into limbo, so to speak, as Blizzard wanted. Otherwise, he pretty much would have immediately returned to try to destroy Azeroth again. ‘Ceased to be’ was used specifically for that reason.<br />
This is Knaak clarifying by what was meant by Sargeras ceasing to be in the War of the Ancients Book, losing his physical form.<br />
Then the World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 1, the most recent lorebook, is cited as saying and specifying:<br />
<br />
Refusing to believe his defeat, Sargeras stepped within the collapsing portal in a futile attempt to rebuild it. It imploded, casting him in to the Nether.<br />
<br />
Sounds pretty demon-like to me. Friggen Alex just fucking with lore as usual.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Statistics don't fucking matter if the game code doesn't allow it, but I guess it's easier to lie to players about the raw data than say nothing at all.<br />
<br />
Optimal and viable are not inclusive of each other.<br />
<br />
If a class played optimally is not viable, it's a balance failure.<br />
<br />
If a class is not viable because it can't be played optimally without reaching a point, it's a design failure.<br />
<br />
If a class is viable but can't be played optimally without reaching a point, THIS is where the line is blurred. It could be part of the carrot on a stick, or a design/balance failure.<br />
<br />
A class must be viable and play optimally regardless of gear. Talents should only serve to improve a niche, and not prevent optimal play. Gear should only serve as a means of progression, not hinder viability.<br />
<br />
They can fabricate whatever game mechanic they want, but if the numbers aren't balanced nobody fucking cares. Tweaking. Numbers. Is. Not. Fucking. Hard.<br />
<br />
It's bad enough players have to rely on DPS meters because the devs have to lie so fucking much about the raw data and their &quot;intended&quot; design goals.</div></div><hr />

Basically every sentence is wrong. He sounds like early teenager who has read his first new age book and now thinks he has all figured out.<br />
1. people know how good they are<br />
2. when only variable what changes is game, then game is changing playing experience<br />

If only it would be 2 % , its more like 20 % .<br />
Stop giving that morron a box to stand on , hes out and so should be his opinions .</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ItachiZaku</div><div class="date">2016-12-23, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To sort of piggy back off what GW said, I do NOT consider max level to be the end all be all of the game, or that &quot;the game starts at 110&quot;, i don't believe that at all. So when people complain about specs/classes that I'm really liking (my level 103 SV hunter for instance), I really don't pay it too much mind. I'm having fun, the meters tell me that I'm really, really effective... that's why I play.</div></div><hr />

It has so many class changes that they cant release it on raid release.<br />
<br />
It has to come before Mythic Nighthold opens at the latest.<br />
<br />
No one really cares about Heroic.</div></div><hr />

Too many, I'm almost tempted to say that &quot;development time spend on these could have been spend elsewhere.&quot; no really, should they just have updated the traditional holidays in WoW which have been the same for ages...?<br />
<br />
Would be interesting to see an official MMO-Champion Poll/Thread about micro-holidays, do people really care about them or not..</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Oh boo hoo, i don't get a legendary for doing micro holidays, I don't want to play anymore!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tell you what, go cry to a CM, at least they're paid to give a fuck.<br />
<br />
Are you dumb or just unwilling to read? I said nothing about legendaries. As a matter of fact, all the examples I gave are all things that don't add to character power. Maybe learn to read instead of being an asshole.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They literally give no fucking incentive. No achievments, no pets, no toys, no titles. There is literally no reason to do these stupid micro-holidays.<br />
<br />
they gave me your salty tears, thats enough</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excuse me if i point out to shadow priest which can top dps meter by doubling dps of 2nd on that same meter.<br />
<br />
If it was 2% then yeah fine, but its closer to 40%.<br />
Even healer which are imo most balanced they ever were are nowhere near 2% difference...</div></div><hr />
