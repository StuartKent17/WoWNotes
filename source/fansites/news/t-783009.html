We have a few more changes which have just come through the pipeline we'd like to share. Some of these changes override changes previously announced in this thread.<br />
<br />
This is the sort of rapid iteration our development teams excel at, which is why we're sometimes unable to share every single tweak we make with the public. Game balance is an ongoing project, but since we have a good platform in this thread for sharing tanking changes, let us have a look at the latest:<br />
<br />

Deathy Acting Funky<br />
For those of you who attended or watched BlizzCon 2010 and claimed a Deathy pet, you may have noticed that he’s acting strange. In fact, he seems to think he’s Grunty the Murloc Marine. This is an unintended consequence of the groupthink from which all murlocs suffer. Deathy will be undergoing an extensive rehabilitation program and should be acting appropriately destructive once his idol, Deathwing, shatters the world in an upcoming patch that will debut prior to the release of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Raid - Al'akir and Nefarian<br />
Paragon released two more raid videos from the beta realms. The first one is the fight against Al'akir, the Air Elemental Lord and end boss of the Throne of the Four Winds. The 2nd video is the last encounter of Blackwing Descent, Nefarian and Onyxia! <br />

<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Beta - Raid Loot Update<br />
Even more items have been discovered on test realms, it looks like Blizzard decided to introduce items with random enchantments in raid and Reforging will probably make that addition very interesting for theorycrafters. <br />

Patch 4.0.3 on test realms<br />
The test realms are currently loaded with 4.0.3 data. Most of the content that will be implemented with this patch will not be activated upon its release. That will come shortly after with patch 4.0.3a, which we are likely to deploy at some point during the 4.0.3 PTR phase. <br />
<br />
There are a few changes, but the majority of the patch 4.0.3 content is &quot;under the hood,&quot; so to speak. There will be a number of bug fixes going in, though some of them will not be active until 4.0.3a either due to the way production on these two patches is being handled. It's somewhat of a unique patching process for us in World of Warcraft's history, so we'll do our best to clarify what is changing and when.

Early level balance<br />
Very few players raid below max level. All of the tanks will be fully capable of handling 5-player dungeons below max level. It's important that things don't feel too broken below max level, but balance is not exposed to anywhere near the same harsh spotlight it is at max level. You'll be fine below level 79.

Healing burst damage<br />
I said that dragons don't breath for 100% of tank health. If they breathe for 60% of tank health and your tank dies, then you made a fatal error in your healing strategy. If the dragon breathes for 60% of tank health while simultaneously clawing the tank for 60% of tank health, then we made an unhealable encounter and deserve to be ridiculed for it.<br />
<br />
You seem to be implying that you shouldn't ever have to worry about the tank dying, which is not our design intent. You should not have to worry about the tank dying in two melee hits before you can get a spell off, assuming you weren't asleep at the wheel for the period prior to those two hits. When the dragon breathes is usually telegraphed far in advance so that everyone can work together (including the tank) to make sure the tank is topped off and emergency spells are at the ready.

Survival Talents<br />
Selfish players won't take survival talents. Pug players who don't interact with a regular group might not. But we think organized guilds will. This kind of situation happens already, and we think it will happen even more in Cataclysm:<br />
<br />
The raid wipes. The leader, or the officer, or the tacticians or whoever start looking through combat logs and parses to see what they can do better. Ah, the Resto shaman kept running out of mana. They start to look at why. Well, this one rogue and one dps warrior took a ton of damage that ended up wasting healer mana. Maybe they stood in the fire. Maybe they were too focused on dps and not on situational awareness. Maybe they skipped over a couple of talents that could have minimized damage. We don't expect every guild to post damage *taken* logs and tell their guys to fix those problems. But some will.

Warrior changes clarification<br />
<br />
Warriors get 15% block chance for choosing Protection.<br />
Their mastery stat on gear increases their chance to block and their chance to critical block.<br />
Shield Block provides +25% block chance temporarily. If any of that chance is wasted (that is it would put you over 100%) the excess counts as critical block instead.<br />
The Vigilance talent no longer provides 3% damage reduction. It is otherwise unchanged.<br />
Finally, Shield Wall provides 50% damage reduction on a 2 min cooldown (talented). If you use the glyph, you can have 50% damage reduction on a 3 min cooldown instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
That clearer? It only sounds complicated because we're trying to explain the difference between the 3.3.5 patch, the 3.9 patch, the current beta patch, and the beta patch after these changes. Those are all different states of the game, so it's often hard to keep track of what change is where. After the big dragon arrives, everything will be in sync.

<br />
Not the same my ass.<br />
<br />
A single ability for each class being similar (or 3 of 4 being the same) does not make the tank classes the same. There have been a ton of abilities that have functioned similarly or exactly the same since classic.<br />
<br />
The goal is to make tanking feel balanced between the classes, while still retaining enough uniqueness so that they aren't exactly the same. The major issues will fall on druids and warriors since they use the exact same resource system. A DK will feel different from a paladin, or a warrior, or etc... until you get to druids vs warriors. But even then some of their mechanics are different.<br />
<br />
Would you rather go back to a game where warriors were the only viable tank and every other tank class that wanted to play 1/3 of their talent trees was a gimp?</div></div><hr />

no i think those that attended got given a code?!?!? just a guess im not sure about that though,,,i jus checked the site myself and it says we who paid to watch it streamed get a email with code in 6 to 8 weeks after the event which basically means we get it about the same time as cata goes live.

I'm not sure if you'll read this, but the three BoE weapons you linked will more than likely--based on the past two expansions- not be world drops.<br />
In Wrath of the Lich King, Reinforced Junkbox from Rogue's Pickpocketing had a small chance to drop the Krol Cleaver , Spineslicer, and The Dusk Blade .<br />
<br />
There were similar versions of these weapons at level 70, from Strong Junkbox, they were The Night Blade, and Spinesever.</div></div><hr />

Pug players who don't interact with a regular group might not. But we think organized guilds will. This kind of situation happens already, and we think it will happen even more in Cataclysm: <br />
<br />
The raid wipes. The leader, or the officer, or the tacticians or whoever start looking through combat logs and parses to see what they can do better. Ah, the Resto shaman kept running out of mana. They start to look at why. Well, this one rogue and one dps warrior took a ton of damage that ended up wasting healer mana. Maybe they stood in the fire. Maybe they were too focused on dps and not on situational awareness. Maybe they skipped over a couple of talents that could have minimized damage. We don't expect every guild to post damage *taken* logs and tell their guys to fix those problems. But some will.<br />
<br />
oh ghostcrawler you make me laugh. <br />
<br />
you know what else causes wipes? hitting the enrage timer on a boss because the dps took pvp survival talents, or even without an enrage timer the fight going on too long and the tank healer going oom because the dps are specced into survival talents when the boss should have bene dead a minute ago. <br />
<br />
the only time people pick up survival talents is when they have a few left over points to dump somewhere and pick up utility; and that's pretty much a no brainer.</div></div><hr />

She wasn't testing what her main will do, she was test what her main *would* do if she started over. She wasn't doing the new lvl 80-85 content, she was leveling a new baby Druid. Which still isn't as stupid as OP implies (since the NE starting zone has been redone), but also isn't some smart attempt to get a head start on leveling her main. Realistically though she'd probably have enjoyed doing a Goblin or Worgen more. While the other starting areas have been revamped, I doubt they got anywhere near the attention that the new ones did.</div></div><hr />

The thing I've noticed from watching all these fights is that, once again (thank god) standing in fire will kill you pretty instantly. Not compared to Kora where you could be healed through the damage...that guy on Nef was taking like 30% health each second. lol</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Retarded Quotes like this just show how disconnected Blizzard actually is from the game. If a DPS is taking damage because theyre standing in something, theyre bad and need to get better or not raid. If they're taking unavoidable damage and making healers oom, a raid leader is going to look at ways to get the healer more mana regen or try to make them be more mana efficient. I think just about the last priority is to tell dps that they should take points out of dps talents to take survivability talents.</div></div><hr />

Savage Defense is massively overpowered on beta and has been dealt with accordingly. Many of the reports of beta raid bosses two-shotting tanks were because that was how much damage the bosses needed to do in order to challenge Feral tanks. With less damage absorbed, the boss damage can be adjusted downwards. We've reduced the multiplier for attack power on the absorption effect (from 65% to 35%, still modified by mastery) and it no longer procs from periodic critical hits.<br />
<br />
Bear Form -- Stamina bonus lowered from 20% to 10% and Heart of the Wild health bonus from 10% to 6%. Bear health should be close to plate tank health with this change.<br />
<br />
Survival Instincts -- Damage reduction changed from 60% to 50%. Cooldown reduced from 5 minutes to 2 minutes. Duration still 12 seconds.<br />

He's absolutely spot-on with it for any fight that's got high raid-wide damage output. There's tons of ways to play more optimally as a DPS to meet any sort of enrage timer, there's very few ways to reduce unavoidable damage.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you should play the game yourself. He's very much up-to-date with stuff.<br />
