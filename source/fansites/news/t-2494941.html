Blue Tweets 
Can you please do something about the phasing in Nazjatar? It's incredibly frustrating to join a group for the pvp event only to not be phased to it, no matter the relogs, teleports or other things done to try and force it. 
Apologies for the frustrations. We’re actively investigating and working on solutions. Thank you for your patience and reports. (WarcraftDevs)

<br />
Here are some other issues we're working on quickly:<br />
<br />
(1/3) We’re increasing the health of all of the lowest-health rare spawns in both Nazjatar and Mechagon, to help more players get a chance to hit them before they die. They also scale in health faster as more players tap them. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1145780618313314304))<br />
<br />
(2/3) We’re making &quot;Dangerous Creatures&quot; only require 1 rare, and we’re fixing a bug where some rare spawns didn’t give quest credit. Combined with the above change, it should be a lot easier to complete. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1145780679344578561))<br />
<br />
(3/3) World Quest bosses in Nazjatar will no longer show up with a silver dragon portrait. After this hotfix, is should be easier to tell what’s a boss for a World Quest and what’s a true rare spawn. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1145780728015269888))</div></div><hr />

While it's indeed true how they should not release the patch until all the PTR issues are solved, your statement is false. I mean, they just said they are working on it. They eventually work out all the important issues, while we beta play their game, but they do.</div></div><hr />

Ohhhh shiiiiiiit, you told them! Damn, they must be crying in a corner now. Good on you! Happy that you moved on though, you shouldn't linger in a game you don't like. Might I suggest also moving on from the forums? It's a bit like stalking an ex's social media... creepy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you seen devs video pre 8.2? Clearly not. Clearly not.<br />
Also on the note: people were bitching about how they want a new patch already and that it was &quot;incredibly late&quot; despite having a new mini raid not so long ago. Imagine making patch late again because of rare mob health is not quite right....<br />

None of the items are spread across Naz'jatar. Each of them is concentrated in one sub zone. Ofc it takes your forever if you are looking for pods all over the zone when they only spawn in the Coral forest . . .<br />

Seriously the only issue with Naz'jatar is that it doesn't hold your hand and people are just playing stupidly.</div></div><hr />

By issue I meant for the problems the poster I responded to sees. I don't consider it an issue. For me it's the only good part. I like the music, the environment is OK at most, the lore is nonexistent, the story is poor, the mobs are annoying instead of interesting but the exploration part, they nailed that down.</div></div><hr />

Just compare sub numbers. We hit 14 million during LK. We're under 1 million now and shrinking. My guilds (I play across a few servers to maximize gold intake) have all seen participation dropoff of 10-25%, and this is still the honeymoon phase of the patch.<br />

<br />
1) There is literally no evidence backing up your claim about sub numbers. It's literally just conjecture.<br />
<br />
2) Classic will not save the game. The community has changed. People will realize how fucking boring Vanilla was, how broken classes were, and how fast you can run out of content. Classic will be full for maybe two months before only the people who enjoy tedious grinds on alts remain.</div></div><hr />

Without a yellow arrow to point to what they have to do they literally can't figure it out.<br />

Locking WQs behind a 15+ minute queue for a tank and healer is exceptionally poor game design.</div></div><hr />
