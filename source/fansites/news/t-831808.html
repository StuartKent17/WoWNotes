In which case I don't expect them to release a video until they have downed her, or are close to downing her because it would jeopardize a possible world first on her too.

Why bring other healers, when Paladins and Priests are the best ones atm? This is a race to get the first kills, this is probably the best setup for Cho'gall as we speak.</div></div><hr />

Why is that a surprise? Shamans, Druids, and Paladins are probably all much more effective for the current content. Priests are on the short end of the stick at the moment, and PoH is only getting worse.</div></div><hr />

O'rly? I'm healing the shit out of Druids and Shamans at the moment, and I'm Disc. Can't really comment on Paladins though, since we don't really raid with a Holydin at the moment.</div></div><hr />

Yes, there wasn't any beta realm testing with Sinestra. Only some abilities - which are supposed to be in the sinestra fight - have been datamined.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She's been confined to a wheelchair following her &quot;encounter&quot; with Deathwing. However, Blizz couldn't find a way to make a wheelchair-bound dragon look menacing, so they hid it under the floor instead.</div></div><hr />

Oh, what an useful and contributing post. Call us when you are doing H Cho'gall too, since this is so boring for you.<br />
<br />
OT: Grats to FTH! To be honest, I didn't expect them to down Cho'gall, and this is fine actually, the 2 top guilds still have 2 bosses AND Sinestra to go, and more than a month has passed, I don't remember Naxx or any Wrath launch raid (Maybe OS 3, don't remember) lasting half as long than this did, so no, I'm not surprised for the kill by now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're joking, right? Holy Priests and Holy Paladins are generally considered the best healers right now. HPriests tend to be on top of the logs in 25-mans by a slight amount, and Holy Paladins tend to be on top of the logs in 10-mans by a slight amount.<br />
<br />
The other healers are all still very good and there are some fights where they are even way better than HPriests/HPaladins, but -overall-, those two are probably best.<br />
<br />
Anyway, their healing composition was:<br />
<br />
Two Holy Paladins<br />
Two Discipline Priests<br />
Two Restoration Shaman<br />
<br />
<br />
I hardly consider 2 of a healer 'class-stacking' of any sort, so most of these comments are pretty invalid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and normaly sens this is there world first they must show a kill vid once two or three guilds have done the kill that is the normal way things is done<br />
<br />
Yeah, until Sinestra and Al'akir are dead and at least -1- guild has gotten 12/12 heroic, I doubt they'll say anything.</div></div><hr />

2 Balance Druids. 2 Resto Shaman.<br />

4 Paladins and 5 Priests. Somehow you're statement doesn't quite fit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pfunkmort</div><div class="date">2011-01-15, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">on the class balance issue. blizzard has stated a number of times that their design goal isn't that all tanks tank everything equally (I assume by extension this also applies to other raid roles). It is that they are all capable of tanking things within a range - such that it's not prohibitive, when looking at the overall playerbase, to have tank class a instead of tank class b in your raid. This is illustrated perfectly with the conversation that occurred during and after sarth 3d progression, with the notorious nerfs to druids and dks (and subsequent paladin buffs and warrior QQ) during the start of ulduar...I'm sure I'm not the only one who remembers the premo tests on the patch dummies in the ulduar ptr, where they cycled through all the tank classes to find ttl, etc. <br />
<br />
If the nature of your comments here is that because for the horde beat an encounter that wasn't even meant to be downed yet, with gear that doesn't properly reflect how the fight is tuned, as the first in the world, hence your classes need buffs, I say meh. If the nature of your comments is instead that fundamentally, over the course of 100 guilds, with relevant gear and preparation, that say...shaman and druids...are incapable of healing the encounters properly, then you might have an argument to make - and one that they'd even listen to. But Blizzard isn't going to nerf entangling roots or whatever because paragon downed an encounter with it. they might (hopefully) look at a class that has overall utility that is higher than their counterparts and deal with it. <br />
<br />
I just find it frustrating that people can immediately jump to these unfair conclusions about class balance, so as to make themselves feel better about what they view to be a broken spec, or frustration with their class...when in reality most of it is just either a, random, or b, a non-standard way of beating an encounter, or c, etc. It's doubly frustrating when blizzard takes the dreck qq and implements changes based on it as though it were the class analytics they presumably pay GC for. /rant</div></div><hr />

Congratulations to them. I'm glad Blizz kept encounters off Beta so the hardcore players have something to do and aren't too terribly bored so soon into the xpac.<br />
<br />
Also, I feel sorry for the people who are so pathetic they have to try and insult people who raid in WoW, on a WoW forum for the game WoW, because those people are better than them or use a certain set-up that does not include their class, and feel that as the poster-children for progression-based raid's leaders, their set-up might shaft the class said insulter might play.</div></div><hr />

It's not that. It's because resto druids can't heal heroic cho'gall. Shamans are there to feed priest &amp; paladins mana, and for sub-par raid healing. So far nothing in patch notes is being done about it, there's huge concerns over this.</div></div><hr />

yes u can, pallies and priests are far better healers than anyone else atm, so anyone that plays anything but pally/priest are gonna be left out on fights if the grp thinks they can do better without them...its in all seriousness not fair, people all pay the same amount of money to play this game, but u arent gonna be invited to a raid bc of the class u play...thats the exact thing that blizz said they dont want, so why cant they just fix what they broke?<br />

btw why do so many people lie on forums about already being up to heroic bosses 0.o its pretty unlikely your not due to the sheer facts that only 614 guilds have downed atleast 1 boss on heroic diffilcuty (and like 400 of them having only downed halfus) prove that the likeliness of you being on here to read the post and comment about how you already do Heroic Modes too is just not true. if you want to prove me wrong tell us the guild your in and your toons name and we can check if your actually in it and have participated in the Heroic bosses = O</div></div><hr />

Actually, Mana Tide Totem is at stupidly broken levels of overpowered right now. If you time it with your mana regen cooldowns and one of those five Priests' Hymn of Hopes, you can regen over half your mana with ease. That is probably why they took the Shaman over another Priest and Paladin.<br />
<br />
Kind of sad to be wanted just for a cooldown, but hey, at least they got a raid spot.</div></div><hr />

Would you guys quit crying allready? Every healer is good enough to heal the encounters in the game atm. You aren't at world firsts level and there is the only place where the set-up actually counts. And if you insist of getting a raid spot over someone who can do your job better atleast for the first guild kill... then I'm sorry to tell you but you are slefish. Healers are fine, if you don't get invited for the first kill because the class that you play, suck it up. If you don't get invited for other kills, you should look to improve your skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dargonax, her &quot;son&quot; was believed to have killed her when he burned away from absorbing one of the Nether Drakes, causing bad stuff to happen given the instability already present in Dargonax. Perhaps she survived in some manner, and now appears as such, given she had already had the Deathwing encounter before we saw her in Outland, as she's Ony and Nef's mother, and they were obviously around for a long time given both were mature wyrms rather than whelps.<br />

Holy Priests and Holy Paladins are generally considered the best healers right now. HPriests tend to be on top of the logs in 25-mans by a slight amount, and Holy Paladins tend to be on top of the logs in 10-mans by a slight amount.<br />
<br />
The other healers are all still very good and there are some fights where they are even way better than HPriests/HPaladins, but -overall-, those two are probably best.<br />
<br />
Anyway, their healing composition was:<br />
<br />
Two Holy Paladins<br />
Two Discipline Priests<br />
Two Restoration Shaman<br />
<br />
<br />
I hardly consider 2 of a healer 'class-stacking' of any sort, so most of these comments are pretty invalid.<br />
<br />
I bet the shamans are there just for mana tide anyway. PoH is by far the best AE heal in the game at the moment.</div></div><hr />

Priests and paladin healers. What a surprise.<br />
<br />
One disc, one holy, 2 resto shamen, 2 holy paladins... i don't think that's a bad setup. I think someone's just got a grudge.</div></div><hr />

This is a race to get the first kills, this is probably the best setup for Cho'gall as we speak.<br />
<br />
Actually, I count 2 Holy Pallys, 2 Resto Shaman 1 Holy Priest and 1 Disc Priest. You didn't actually think they used 9 healers for that encounter, did you? There is a damage buff in the last phase, which is why you see 3 Shadow Priests. They scale in a linear fashion, like Warriors, so I'm guessing they racked up some serious damage in that phase. Why bring the other DPS when you can bring 11 Druids? Oh, wait. That's already happened, too, for a world first. The real problem here is encounters that didn't take into account the strengths and weaknesses of the various classes. It's almost like each encounter is optimized for a unique raid composition.<br />
<br />
TLDR- Get into a big guild so you can play musical chairs with your raid comp.<br />

O'rly? I'm healing the shit out of Druids and Shamans at the moment, and I'm Disc. Can't really comment on Paladins though, since we don't really raid with a Holydin at the moment.<br />
<br />
Get better Druids and Shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As it should be considering that priests are pigeon holed to enormous amounts with this chakra crap. If they have to worry about what chakra state they are in through whole of the fight, and fighting to keep in that state but then again fighting against the CD to be able to switch to a different chakra on time, they should top the damn healing meters. Until every other healers get some crap class dynamic like that, holy priest should be on top. <br />
<br />
That's how it should be - How it is however, is that the charka is useless crap forced on priests. Instead of focusing on healing, they have to focus on their chakra state and if you somehow don't heal in a chakra or are in the wrong chakra for the wrong phase, your heals are worse as that of a bandage. <br />
<br />
Druids aren't that bad as people try to portray them, their mastery is crap, yet they still heal well and are almost on par with priests and paladins. Shamans have the only reason to complain at the moment.<br />

Congratulations to them. I'm glad Blizz kept encounters off Beta so the hardcore players have something to do and aren't too terribly bored so soon into the xpac.<br />
<br />
Also, I feel sorry for the people who are so pathetic they have to try and insult people who raid in WoW, on a WoW forum for the game WoW, because those people are better than them or use a certain set-up that does not include their class, and feel that as the poster-children for progression-based raid's leaders, their set-up might shaft the class said insulter might play.<br />

<br />
Yeah, no.<br />
<br />
She looks like Kil'Jaeden because she's standing in lava, has wings and horns. That's the end of the comparison. If you actually compare the two, say, by using this image of Kil'Jaeden (http://images.wikia.com/wowwiki/images/a/a5/KiljaedenSunwell.jpg), you'll note that none of the other features are even remotely similar. She's Kil'Jaeden in pretty much the same way that Sindragosa and Malygos are the same.</div></div><hr />
