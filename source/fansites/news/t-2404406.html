Blizzard just released a blog post to discuss updates on Classic WoW.<br />
Greetings! Development of World of Warcraft Classic is underway, and we’re very excited to share some of the challenges and solutions we’re working on. As we mentioned last BlizzCon, the process of restoring the classic game is not straightforward, and it’s important to us to take the time and effort to get it right—this includes poring over numerous game versions, data, and code; meticulously scrutinizing all the changes we’ve made over the years. Rest assured: The WoW Classic team is hard at work making it a reality, and we’re at a point in development where we’re ready to share some of the things we’ve been working on.<br />
<br />
WoW Classic: First Prototype<br />
<br />
The first—and among the most important—decision we had to make was which version of the game to focus on. As many of you have noted, the classic period was two years long and full of changes. Core features like Battlegrounds were introduced in patches after WoW’s original launch, and class design similarly changed over time. After careful consideration, we decided on Patch 1.12: Drums of War as our foundation, because it represents the most complete version of the classic experience.<br />
<br />
Once we had our starting point, we began taking stock of what we had in the source code and what we could make available, which included restoring the original development database from archival backups. After stitching various key pieces together, we had a locally rebuilt version of Patch 1.12 running internally. The team could create characters and do basic questing and leveling—and dying, which we did many times. For testing purposes. Obviously.<br />
<br />
Our initial runs exposed a few (expected) issues: the game sometimes crashed, didn’t recognize our modern video cards, and was incompatible with our current login system. That first pass also couldn’t support any of our modern security and anti-cheating capabilities. Clearly we had a lot of work to do to make WoW Classic live up to the Blizzard standard of quality, and deliver the experience players want.<br />
<br />
The Path Forward: Second Prototype<br />
<br />
Speaking of engineering, World of Warcraft is a very data-driven game, which means the basic code is flexible and the specific way it behaves is controlled by information contained in databases. Things like quests, monsters, items, and the rules for how these all interact are defined by the designers and artists in data.<br />
<br />
So we asked ourselves, would it still be possible to deliver an authentic classic experience if we took our modern code, with all its back-end improvements and changes, and used it to process the Patch 1.12 game data? While that might seem counterintuitive, this would inherently include classic systems like skill ranks, old quests and terrain, talents, and so on, while later features like Transmog and Achievements would effectively not exist because they were entirely absent from the data. After weeks of R&amp;D, experimentation, and prototyping, we were confident we could deliver the classic WoW content and gameplay without sacrificing the literally millions of hours put in to back-end development over the past 13 years.<br />
<br />
While our initial effort helped us determine the experience we wanted to provide, this second prototype really defined how we’d get there. Starting from a modern architecture—with all its security and stability changes—means the team’s efforts can be focused on pursuing an authentic classic experience. Any differences in behavior between our development builds and the patch 1.12 reference can be systematically cataloged and corrected, while still operating from a foundation that’s stable and secure.<br />
<br />
Digging In<br />
<br />
So what does it take to recreate an authentic classic experience with modern engineering? Let’s start by categorizing the different types of game data that make up WoW:<br />
<br />
<br />
Table data: This kind of information is almost always represented as numbers. How many hit points a creature has, the amount of Strength an item grants, or where and when certain creatures spawn, are all examples of the numerical data we store in our databases. We can also store and enforce relationships between different pieces of data.<br />
File data: This is often very dense data like 3D models, textures, animations and terrain. Our user interface is built up from XML and Lua files. Many of the art files do not use the same file formats that commercial art tools spit out. Our build pipeline takes these raw art files and translates them into something optimized for our game to read and process.<br />
Lua scripts: Some features are driven by Lua scripts written by designers, allowing them to easily define custom behaviors for server-side logic without requiring deep engineering knowledge.<br />
<br />
<br />
How Engineering Has Changed<br />
<br />
One challenge we face is that all the classic data is in the original format used at launch, but that format has changed substantially in the intervening years. Major work needs to be done in this area to make the modern client compatible with the classic data.<br />
<br />
For example, spells could originally only perform three actions on the spell’s target. In table form, that looked something like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/classicchart1.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/classicchart1.jpg)<br />
<br />
As you can see, there is a lot of space taken up by ‘Nothing’. Over the course of WoW’s lifetime, we’ve improved our data design and normalized much of our database data. Today, that same data would be separated out like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/classicchart2.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/classicchart2.jpg) <br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/classicchart3.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/june/classicchart3.jpg)<br />
<br />
In this form, there is much less wasted space and spells are no longer limited to three effects. But before we can load any database data, we need to transform the old data layout into the new one. This is not limited to spells, as almost every game system (including items, creatures, player characters, spawning, AI, and more) has had its database layout altered over the years.<br />
<br />
Looking Ahead<br />
<br />
All the work we’re doing will ultimately allow us to recreate an authentic classic experience on a platform that is much more optimized and stable, helping us avoid latency and stability issues. Additional modern improvements will include modern anti-cheat/botting detection, customer service and Battle.net integration, and similar conveniences that do not affect the core gameplay experience.<br />
<br />
We are looking forward to the challenges ahead and share your passion for the classic game; every code check-in data conversion we make brings WoW Classic closer to providing that authentic experience you—and we—want. Thanks for joining us on this journey.</div></div><hr />

Simple solution is to allow the players to toggle between old and new models, imo.</div></div><hr />

No, you cant. You can use the old skins, but not the old models (animations). I like the current skins, I just don't enjoy most updated skeletons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You still can. It might just be one of the options hidden behind an addon because I was doing it recently. The only exception iirc is night elves now always use their new models because the old models can't support demon hunter animations.</div></div><hr />

Thats not the 1.12 client. All of what you listed are things that blizzard can turn on/off or edit server side. And has nothing to do with the base in which they build the game on.<br />
<br />
Only thing this affects are talents, which can be countered by increasing health and damage things does.</div></div><hr />

The easiest analogy I can provide is having a junker hatchback car when you're in highschool, and you think it's amazing and great but the car is a total PoS. Eventually you grow up and get a career then buy yourself a luxury sedan. You then, a few years later, trade that great car in for an exact copy of your old crappy high school car (that runs slightly better due to a minor tune up)..... it still doesn't have power steering or better fuel mileage, it has a cassette deck (or possibly an 8-track) instead of satellite or even a CD deck. no gps, nothing.... and the AC probably doesn't work. Plain dumb, no one, that isn't a complete idiot would do that. <br />
<br />
And before any dumb &quot;it has character&quot; responses pop up, no, old and busted doesn't automatically mean character and your piece of junk highschool hatchback isn't a cherry roadster or classic hotrod, it's a piece of crap.</div></div><hr />

I'm more amused recalling comments from some people, and not even here, that they're expecting it to release at Blizzcon, and they're gonna spend 2019 standing on the bridge in Ironforge getting admired by awestruck players.<br />

This is pretty far from a releasable product. 2020...maybe. Beta, maybe. They're not even going near time frames here, except &quot;we have a lot of work to do&quot;.<br />

What a colossal waste of resources.<br />
<br />
I don't think the team is that big, and they're not taking away from other teams to do this. Blizzard is big enough that they can have a small team work on this, and not effect anything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm guessing you just pay a monthly fee and have access to both ... but I hope you can just do classic for less than $13-15. Otherwise, I'll stick to GW2 (the price is right).</div></div><hr />

They'll just gate the actual content behind server-side changes. Interesting to know whether they'll even bother with traditional patches outside of content updates though and if this will have an impact on overall progression length which is a finite experience. <br />
<br />
Guess it depends on how much work they want to put in to it. Will we start MC with 16 debuff slots and buffed 1.12 characters or will they still follow a faithful patch cycle barring bugs and exploits being ironed out from the start?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Molten Core/Blackwing Lair/Ahn'qiraj will all be fairly silly with 16 debuffs and Naxxramas class redesigns. Like ridiculously fast kills.<br />
<br />
Much of the early gearing process will be irrelevant as well, which will also mean rapid gearing and destruction of the most of the game's raid content.<br />
<br />
Also, no opening of Ahn'qiraj :(All vanilla raids were always going to get utterly destroyed because players are a lot better/more knowledgeable now then they were all those years ago.</div></div><hr />

All of what you listed are things that blizzard can turn on/off or edit server side. And has nothing to do with the base in which they build the game on.<br />
<br />
Only thing this affects are talents, which can be countered by increasing health and damage things does.<br />
<br />
They said they're doing patch 1.12. I assume they mean 1.12 in every way. I doubt they start retuning raids.<br />

Go sit in a capital city and cry because you have nothing to do while trolling in the trade chat with anal joke<br />
<br />
My bet is this - it will be popular at release, because nostalgia, and it's something new. <br />
<br />
I'm giving it 6 to 8 months for the servers to be ghosttowns. <br />
<br />
Players today won't play vanilla like it was played. Everything is &quot;go go go go go go&quot; now, completely datamined, botted, and nobody is going to take 4-5 hours to crawl through UBRS, and deal with the final boss, and getting a hunter who can kite the dragonoid. They're gonna bum rush all the content, expecting to chain pull, and wipe their asses off, and ragequit. A bunch of tryhards will game their way through AQ and just sit in capital cities and sneer at everyone. Nobody is gonna grind Hydraxian rep to deal with Onyxia, or grind fire resist. Chat is going to be 1000000 more of shitshow than it is now, and who the fuck wants to sit in a city chat for 4 hours looking for tanks for Dire Maul? Or take the HOURS it takes to clear old school dungeons, let alone raids. Scholomance is longer than most raids - and in parts, were harder, as raids back then were mostly just DPS pressure with simple tactics. <br />
<br />
The current day WoW players don't play that game. They play the current wow, which doesn't support the old game play, either. It's going to be brutal. I'm gonna laugh my balls off as the wheels come off this. But hey, you wanted it, you're getting it. And, you get to pay to do it. :) <br />
<br />
The first graveyard run on the first Molten Core wipe is gonna be fucking hilarious. &quot;ARGHIFUCKINGQUITHOWDAREYOUMAKEMERUNFROMTHEGRAVEYARD!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll be honest, it would be great to see the original Alterac Valley again, or the Onyxia event in Stormwind. But overall...nobody is gonna like it. None of the quality of life improvements, all of the suck. <br />
<br />
Yeah, it's totally gonna kill retail. Kill it with the sniveling and complaining, more likely. <br />

Why would they straight up lie to us? They told us repeatedly that one of the core reasons they couldn't make a classic version was because the data was long ago written over. Now they admit they have archived versions of it that they booted up with other bits thrown in. Ugh. Now I feel like a moron for defending them when they said they didnt have the code and that they would never do classic.<br />
<br />
Well to be fair, alot of people at my office think that old files are no longer available after they deleted them or replaced them with newer versions. <br />
When in fact those files are most likely still present in backups. Recent files can be restored easily, but very old files (1 year or older) are on backup tapes and it takes more effort to restore them. <br />
<br />
And lets not forget that WoW is like 14 years old or something. In those 14 years, the backup system was probably changed 2 or 3 times. And the people who were operating them at the time are likely no longer working there.</div></div><hr />

Nobody would play it properly, anyway. They didn't back in vanilla, which is why they changed it. I'm glad i got to experience it pre-1.12. It was awesome. It's completely wasted on players these days, as they have no interest in playing content like that.</div></div><hr />

I think it was Chilton who said that their record keeping was crap back then, and they were over-writing the database and not saving the original values - so if they changed a variable on fireball, they have no record of where it started at. Considering the endless revisions that probably exist, and how many variables have to be recreated, is why this is a large job. For the client, yeah, they have dev backups, but don't forget that the heart of the game was live databases, which didn't get backed up, or only partially, and they didn't long-term archive everything.<br />
<br />
But they're &quot;lying&quot;, lol. They have no reason to lie about it. They had shit records and workflow back then. This stubborness of the usual suspects to accuse them of lying all the time is hilarious, it's like they did it on purpose, that Chilton sat there in his office and twirled his Snively Whiplash mustache and gloated &quot;They'll never play classic again! Muahahahahahahah!&quot; <br />
<br />
It's so fucking childish, and pointless. They lost a bunch of numbers, get over it already. But nooooooo, you can't be glad they're making the effort, they're LYING. Because I don't get what I want RIGHT NOW. Or something.</div></div><hr />

Shouldn't we be happy that there are several versions of the game and everybody can chose and enjoy the version they like? What is it to you if you can enjoy Classic and others enjoy Legion or BfA? Your wish that Classic kills retail will eventually mean, that you also lose the funding that made Classic servers a reality.<br />

Seriously now, I don't think it will litterally kill retail. But I expetect a slow down in Retail.<br />
Let's just say, I am not really confident with BaF success.<br />
Blizzard will be carefull upon the release of Classic (IMO), for exemple, at end of the expansion and even wait before releasing another expansion.<br />
Some people will stick to it, like they stick on private server, some will play for the nostalgia and after the first walk in the capital city, they will log out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1:30 dungeons? Maybe Ragefire, or that prison one in Stormwind. Most, if not all of the rest of them could take all night to clear. Zul Farrack, Uldaman, LBRS, UBRS, all of them took a decent amount of time to work through. Remember, this is 1.12 - no heirlooms, no boosting, just found gear on 1.12 era content, and shit took forever to die, even trash, in lower level content. You had to actually take your time and pull carefully. You died, fast. Wipes happened, a lot. Plus, graveyard runs eat up a lot of time. High end stuff, like BRD, Scholo, Strat - one wing was easily more than 1.5 hours. <br />
<br />
1 hr for BGs...later on, sure. I remember signing up for pre-1.12 Alterac Valley, and playing for hours, and not getting in. People would just go to the Crossroads or Tarran Mill because it was easier than waiting for a BG. They didn't really get efficient queus for BGs until TBC, from what I remember. <br />
<br />
Crossroads, before HK was even a thing, now THAT was fun. Nothing to win, or lose, just good old beat the brat with the ball fun. Just seeing how far into Tarran Mill you could get as Alliance before getting dogpiled was a blast.<br />

Are you crazy? Xrealm wwas added only in WOTLK before that you had to wait ppl on you own server to do content. And before TBC you had to spam in trade chat do find ppl to do stuff, while on TBC they added the dungeon group finder tool but only with ppl from your own server.</div></div><hr />

If we could get our stuff again (I deleted a warrior once that had the plate armor from ZG- including the helmet I could never get again) AND still use them for transmog/mounts and such, Blizz might get more people to go to the classic to grind and fight and work to get them. It will still take the same amount of effort it once did, so I don't see the problem with it. Without it, though, not that anyone cares, but I for one won't bother going back to do all that again if the hard work just stays on that server.</div></div><hr />

Maybe one wing of Mauradon. And even then, it took a while. I don't remember doing the whole place in one run, because it took so long. Getting to the Princess was the point.<br />

I didn't run the live side of Strat until nearly the end of vanilla, because nobody wanted to run it, because it took too long, and the drops weren't that good.</div></div><hr />

This isn't a remaster, it's a full-fledged retro version of an MMO that they have since moved on from (Even auctioned the old servers). I'm sure it took countless resources and man/woman hours over the years to create what we have today in BFA and i'm sure that it will take the same effort for them to bring classic servers to life again.

The only problem is now i don't have the time nor the inclination to repeat something i did already. So ya for some people this will be amazing, but for the majority I think they will p[lay it then realize they no longer have the time to invest into classic like they use too, and all just to do the same thing you have done done before.<br />
<br />
I also see quite a few people not playing this because of the subscription, because I highly doubt Blizzard is putting all this effort into this just to make this free. Blizzard most likely won't go down the one-time payment route either since they are a company that likes money.</div></div><hr />

There has been no other company that would do this for their customers just because they asked. This isn't a remaster, it's a full-fledged retro version of an MMO that they have since moved on from (Even auctioned the old servers). I'm sure it took countless resources and man/woman hours over the years to create what we have today in BFA and i'm sure that it will take the same effort for them to bring classic servers to life again. Blizz truly loves us it seems.<br />
<br />
Runescape brought back their classic game. But they probably had much of the code (still intact) unlike Blizzard. <br />
<br />
I agree with you completely.</div></div><hr />

Thats exactly why they play it cause they are too cheap to pay for a sub, and the population on those servers are nothing to be based on cause they are too small. Plus if you think those ppl are gonna switch for the official server if they can play for free you are very wrong. Maybe some small amount of them might but majority sure wont.</div></div><hr />

You being in a bad guild doesn't make vanilla raids bad. We had a roster big enough that there were always 10 raiders on the bench just waiting to replace whatever scrub couldn't set aside the full 3 hours( - a 10 min break in the middle ) to raid.</div></div><hr />

They really need to do it the way Nost did it so it's not *as* faceroll. 1.12.1 but with 1.0 itemization that doesn't come in until patch 1.6 iirc.</div></div><hr />

I really wanna try and understand this. If the old models was the default and you saw everone with Those models if you choose to. Would it ruin it for you if someone Else could choose the new models? (you would still see the classic models)</div></div><hr />

<br />
you do realize you can disable them right? I would prefer the option to have it defaulted to original player models with the option to turn on the newer model so the player chooses whether or not to see the old or new models. There's no real reason to disclude the feature? Sure it didn't exist in Vanilla, but player models old or new do change the core game in any way, it's just a display option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shouldn't we be happy that there are several versions of the game and everybody can chose and enjoy the version they like? What is it to you if you can enjoy Classic and others enjoy Legion or BfA? Your wish that Classic kills retail will eventually mean, that you also lose the funding that made Classic servers a reality.<br />
<br />
The fact people don't realize this really appalls me.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, let people play whatever they want to play without bashing one or another. The endless banter which have created a feud between those who play the progressive live version, those who wish for a complete relaunch with progressive patches and those who wish for a remastered version akin to what has been proposed albeit with modern features. I perceive it as nothing more than a group of children explaining why toy A, B and C is superior to one another.<br />
<br />
<br />
While I have never been on the &quot;Classic boat&quot;, I have no qualms with people wanting to join those servers and have an authentic, yet already explored experience in the form of information, if they so wish to do such.<br />
<br />
Therefore, just play what you want and keep your arguments within your own circle (this case, live vs. Classic). Blizzard is the main actor in this scenario as well as the producer and director. Us players are but side characters and admirers/critics whom states a feedback regarding the way they are going through.</div></div><hr />

Retail community is never happy too mate. Have you been on forums? They are not happy on things which are still in beta and blizz has stated they are working on it :D Players are never happy, everyone has their own ideal wow which has own ideal stuff, some might have pathfinder and no lfr, some might have just lfr and no pathfinder, some might have no transmog and one of those above. This is what blizz is trying to compromise with.</div></div><hr />

While it's been in the advanced System options since patch 6.0.2, it essentially became obsolete when patch 7.0.3 removed the skeletons and race-specific animations that had been used by the original models, replacing them with their HD counterparts.<br />
<br />
I was not happy about it, nor was I the only one upset over the changes. I can still remember Watcher's post when this was brought up in the Legion alpha forums, and his reaction came across as genuinely surprised that people would actually prefer the classic versions.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asotcha</div><div class="date">2018-06-15, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just want to know what the payment model will be!<br />
<br />
I'm guessing you just pay a monthly fee and have access to both ... but I hope you can just do classic for less than $13-15. Otherwise, I'll stick to GW2 (the price is right).<br />
<br />
My armchair guess is that they'll roll it into the price of a regular sub. It would make the most sense to give people who are already subbed the ability to easily make toons in either version, so they probably won't want to set a pay-obstacle between them and that. I dunno if they'd go to the trouble of making a separate cheaper sub to only access that mode.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, as I was writing that, I realized it'll probably have its own place on the launcher list of availible games because regular patches to modern WoW wont need to include Classic and vice versa.<br />
<br />
I wonder what they'll end up doing.</div></div><hr />

We should be able to. I believe you'd still have to fulfill all of the requirements to open the gates before you can actually go in.

No, they said they are using patch 1.12 as a base for their development of the server, that is something completely different than a 1.12 replica.<br />
<br />
If they retune raids or not doesnt matter much, the raids will be cleared very fast by hardcore guilds no matter how hard they tune the bosses, and AQ and naxx is still as hard as they used to back in vanilla due to almost every class already having recieved they revamps by that time, with the exception of a very few.</div></div><hr />

Simple solution is to allow the players to toggle between old and new models, imo.<br />
<br />
that wont work because the new models come with new animations and that wont be a toggle feature its hard coded like if you toggle old models on retail now you still get new animations which look weird with old models.<br />

again, that doesn't work as you keep new animations with old models, try it on retail now it looks weird as and there is no compromise needed you are playing classic not legion so the models will represent such.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it wont and even if it did you would still have to do blackwing molten core and aq multiple times to get geared before even seeing naxx in saying that with 1.12 patch comes buffed gear and items that are not normally on loot tables, onslaught girdle perditions blade buffed deathbone set in scholomance, spell hit rating gear in dungeons for casters etc so having 1.12 with 1.12 items is more detrimental to the overall progress then I would say having the raids out on launch would be though I doubt that will be the case</div></div><hr />

Those raids/dungeons are a joke from today's perspective. Naxx mechanics, for example, are laughably easy for people accustomed to modern-day mythic or even heroic raiding. And Naxx was on a whole different level than the earlier ones, which were RIDICULOUSLY simple by today's standards.<br />
<br />
The biggest barrier to Naxx is gear, as raids weren't exactly well-scaled in that respect. But given how easy most raids were, you can probably just skip ahead fairly easily and not even bother with things like MC. Use ZA/AQ20/AQ40 to get some a handful of good pieces, and then you'll be set for Naxx. Well itemized dungeon blues or certain quest rewards will easily be able to substitute for raid gear (like the 2% crit trinket from Blackrock Spire) if you compensate with skill.<br />
<br />
Remember, 99% of raiders at the time were utter morons. People had never heard of theorycrafting, or even damage meters. Their talent trees were all over the place. They used abilities more or less at random. Addons were mostly QoL and not for performance. Not being afk and simply moving out of the fire while pressing 112112112 was enough to clear a raid for most people. LITERALLY.<br />
<br />
I remember some people at the time looked into how much skill matters, and there's some amazing results out there. People soloing dungeons at max level, or two-manning dungeons people went in with 10-man raid (like UBRS or Scholo). There was even a Molten Core raid with people in all green items, iirc.

And Naxx was on a whole different level than the earlier ones, which were RIDICULOUSLY simple by today's standards.<br />
<br />
The biggest barrier to Naxx is gear, as raids weren't exactly well-scaled in that respect. But given how easy most raids were, you can probably just skip ahead fairly easily and not even bother with things like MC. Use ZA/AQ20/AQ40 to get some a handful of good pieces, and then you'll be set for Naxx. Well itemized dungeon blues or certain quest rewards will easily be able to substitute for raid gear (like the 2% crit trinket from Blackrock Spire) if you compensate with skill.<br />
<br />
Remember, 99% of raiders at the time were utter morons. People had never heard of theorycrafting, or even damage meters. Their talent trees were all over the place. They used abilities more or less at random. Addons were mostly QoL and not for performance. Not being afk and simply moving out of the fire while pressing 112112112 was enough to clear a raid for most people. LITERALLY.<br />
<br />
I remember some people at the time looked into how much skill matters, and there's some amazing results out there. People soloing dungeons at max level, or two-manning dungeons people went in with 10-man raid (like UBRS or Scholo). There was even a Molten Core raid with people in all green items, iirc.

something that both you and the person you quoted are forgetting and/or ignoring, is the fact that they have rebuilt the whole game from scratch using their current systems and coding, which means that while the game may well be in the version of 1.12, they can easily disable raids/dungeons and do a timed release like they did in the pass that the older code/systems couldn't allow (like they do now every new expansion by blocking off the raid portals), so you're not gonna see people clearing naxx in a matter of months it's highly likely in fact that it will take years to get there.</div></div><hr />

But that's not the classic experience, is it, if you retrace the raid release schedule BUT with everything on 1.12 patch levels. There were substantial changes to some classes in later raid tiers.<br />
<br />
I mean, I'm not saying they couldn't do it. They could do lots of things. But it wouldn't be vanilla if they changed it.<br />
<br />
Also, it doesn't matter - the same thing would apply to whatever raid is available at the time. It'll be cleared INSTANTLY.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the minute it's open, it's cleared within a few hours.<br />
<br />
Players do not have to do research this time around, they know what was done back then and they'll do what they did back then and it's going to make it so much easier in general. Raids back then were not even remotely hard, they were a time sink and had huge roster requirements, and it's hard to keep a 40 man or bigger roster engaged and have all of them be available for multiple hours per day to raid. Hence why everything was slower, because it was simply so hard to keep everyone showing up and finding a stable schedule with 40 players or more isn't a very easy task.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
that wont work because the new models come with new animations and that wont be a toggle feature its hard coded like if you toggle old models on retail now you still get new animations which look weird with old models.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
how is it dead?<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
again, that doesn't work as you keep new animations with old models, try it on retail now it looks weird as and there is no compromise needed you are playing classic not legion so the models will represent such.<br />
<br />
again, i think that's the best &quot;down the middle&quot; compromise<br />
<br />
since you seem incapable of seeing why this would work I'l spell it out for you.<br />
<br />
the switching of models from old and new would only be for YOUR screen, other players would only see what they switch on or off....it's that simple and no it wouldn't look weird hence, the compromise....get off your high horse you classic purist and realize that this isn't a bad idea in the slightest<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
it wont and even if it did you would still have to do blackwing molten core and aq multiple times to get geared before even seeing naxx in saying that with 1.12 patch comes buffed gear and items that are not normally on loot tables, onslaught girdle perditions blade buffed deathbone set in scholomance, spell hit rating gear in dungeons for casters etc so having 1.12 with 1.12 items is more detrimental to the overall progress then I would say having the raids out on launch would be though I doubt that will be the case<br />
<br />
yeah i dont think that people realize how hard the game was, it wasn't neccessarily because people didn't have the knowledge, but the numbers didn't actually match up....they are gonna get a real wake up call when they get hit hard by a boss because the gear wasn't itemized very well and you actually had to have skill....plus most people don't remember that you needed FORTY people for naxx and aq and other raids....<br />
<br />
if you think raids are hard with trying to coordinate 10-15 people now I mean geez wait till it's 40 people that aren't geared and can't get past trash mobs in molten core lol</div></div><hr />

Maybe a little grind for attunement. But ezpz.<br />
That's not what it says. It's says they're using 1.12 as their foundation for rebuilding the game using modern back-end infrastructure. From there they can strip away or add whatever they want or need to do.</div></div><hr />

But releasing 1.12.... does this mean we miss the whole event towards opening the AQ gates (often seen as one of the best experiences for plenty Vanilla players, apart from the connection problems during the actual opening :P ) and other great moments during the course of Vanilla.

Thing that strikes me about this thread is that people are viewing the classic server experience incredibly wrong. MMO-C seems to be made up of hard core raiders, and are viewing it from an &quot;end game&quot; point of view. Classic servers in m view are not about raids at all A very very minute portion of players raided at all back then, and raiding was maybe the least important game feature in classic WOW. The core gamer base didnt really care that much about raiding that much. The game then was much more about the journey to max level, questing, exploration and the feeling that WOW was a living breathing world. It was very much not about loot or consuming end game content or any of those things. The vast majority just liked the world experience, before everything was about teleporting in and out of content and leveling to max in a couple days. It took most people months to reach max level. That will certainly not appeal to many here, who want to just consume &quot;end game&quot; content and view questing, leveling and exploration as annoying road bumps to &quot;progression&quot;. If you are a hard core raider, play War of Azeroth, this game is not really designed for you. My guess is that the servers will be very popular with people that enjoyed WOW as a WORLD, not as a vehicle for &quot;end game&quot; content. Old WOW was a long term experience, new WOW is not. I will always contend that the WOW developers always listened to the wrong segment of their gaming population and would be much more popular now if it was closer to old WOW at this point than the new consumable WOW experience it has become.</div></div><hr />

+1 for this post. That was Vanilla indeed for many, and that's why I loved it so much.<br />
Not sure if I will experience it like that again (lack of free time, left Europe also last year so life is hectic) but I will certainly dive back into it and see what it will be like once again to just be out there in the Vanilla zones.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ranger007</div><div class="date">2018-06-16, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, yes exactly... should have added this to my post, a few above this one...<br />
<br />
Classic WoW was all about the journey. That was definitely part of the magic and allure for me. I loved taking my time exploring, doing professions, gathering resources for professions, etc.. I really wasn’t as concerned with rushing to max level content, although I enjoyed seeing the fancy Naxx-geared players. I saw that as something to aspire to, if I wanted to, at some point.<br />
<br />
This is really how I’ve always spent my time in game and I’ve never let my sub expire. I watch a lot of Classic YouTube videos and I do look at my (many) old screenshots from 2006-ish and I miss seeing the WoW as it was back then. The environment, the way classes played. I do miss all the little details that made my immersion so enjoyable (buying reagents, arrows, etc). I’ve always been more suited to Classic WoW type play.<br />
<br />
I realize others don’t feel this way and that’s just fine. I love and appreciate current WoW, too (not all the changes, but you get the gist). I just wish there wasn’t such a big divide between those that love Classic and those that love currently WoW. Why so much hate? Why can’t the majority of both “sides” get along and all of us just honor and appreciate both, whichever we want to play? Like I said before, I’ll be playing both! :) Looking forward to the original charm of Classic.</div></div><hr />

Well, thing is, the toggle now only brings back the old skin, not the old animations, which is what I want.<br />

I really wanna try and understand this. If the old models was the default and you saw everone with Those models if you choose to. Would it ruin it for you if someone Else could choose the new models? (you would still see the classic models)<br />
<br />
No, I wouldn't mind it as a toggle and everyone can use whatever they choose. I just personally want to have the old models + old skeletons. I don't care if others choose to use the new ones, I wouldn't need to see it if I toggled 'em off. :&gt;</div></div><hr />

dont forget that 90% of dps will be any combination of warrior/mage/rogue pumping numbers which will allow people to 20 man 40 man instances :) if you will bring in 40 man raid filled with mages/rogues/warriors it will be a joke - imagine combustion runing through 10 mages or 15 mages ^^ :P</div></div><hr />

You shouldn't have believed them in the first place - they do stuff like this all the time.

As someone who studies this subject (Anyone can understand this anyway), figures why vanilla was so unstable, laggy and such... Those tables are awful and inefficient haha<br />
New models make much more sense obviously. They have lots of work ahead.<br />

vanilla runs better than the modern game does, your'e talking out your ass. <br />

Glad they're putting so much effort into something that people will play, and quit after a week.<br />
<br />
It's amazing that there are so many posts like this? If Blizzard re-released Classic as it was it would be a riproaring success to shake the gaming industry. but if they continue on this path of massive infrastructure changes to the way the game functions then they might lose the charm of the game, and people might not play at all. <br />
<br />
Anyway, if people don't want to play it, that will be a problem of Blizzard's making.<br />

Using patch 1.12 is fine. But just make sure you don’t release all raid content at launch. Otherwise it’s dead for me at least<br />

Progression is dead no matter what. People already know everything about all the raids in vanilla and even if someone has been living under a rock, the raids are easy enough that people will clear them faster than LFR is being cleared.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biomega</div><div class="date">2018-06-16, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thing that strikes me about this thread is that people are viewing the classic server experience incredibly wrong. MMO-C seems to be made up of hard core raiders, and are viewing it from an &quot;end game&quot; point of view. Classic servers in m view are not about raids at all A very very minute portion of players raided at all back then, and raiding was maybe the least important game feature in classic WOW. The core gamer base didnt really care that much about raiding that much. The game then was much more about the journey to max level, questing, exploration and the feeling that WOW was a living breathing world. It was very much not about loot or consuming end game content or any of those things. The vast majority just liked the world experience, before everything was about teleporting in and out of content and leveling to max in a couple days. It took most people months to reach max level. That will certainly not appeal to many here, who want to just consume &quot;end game&quot; content and view questing, leveling and exploration as annoying road bumps to &quot;progression&quot;. If you are a hard core raider, play War of Azeroth, this game is not really designed for you. My guess is that the servers will be very popular with people that enjoyed WOW as a WORLD, not as a vehicle for &quot;end game&quot; content. Old WOW was a long term experience, new WOW is not. I will always contend that the WOW developers always listened to the wrong segment of their gaming population and would be much more popular now if it was closer to old WOW at this point than the new consumable WOW experience it has become.<br />
That was certainly the case.<br />
<br />
BACK THEN.<br />
<br />
Back when WoW was new, MMORPGs were new, gaming wasn't this mainstream, and the internet hadn't blown up to today's proportions.<br />
<br />
That sort of naive player doesn't really exist anymore. You can get the old environment back, but you can't get the old people back. Bringing back vanilla WoW won't erase 10+ years of WoW experience from people's minds, and it won't make new players coming into the game into blank slates that had never touched an MMO before. 5-year olds play games now. The toothpaste is out of the tube, there's no squeezing it back in.</div></div><hr />

Well, even things like getting raid-ready blues from places like Stratholme is hard work, and you can't jump from Molten Core to Nefarian, it just doesn't work that way. but the ability to farm greens from Dire Maul (even if they don't release the dungeon, from outside the dungeon) will kill most of that progression.</div></div><hr />

Naxx mechanics, for example, are laughably easy for people accustomed to modern-day mythic or even heroic raiding. And Naxx was on a whole different level than the earlier ones, which were RIDICULOUSLY simple by today's standards.<br />
<br />
The biggest barrier to Naxx is gear, as raids weren't exactly well-scaled in that respect. But given how easy most raids were, you can probably just skip ahead fairly easily and not even bother with things like MC. Use ZA/AQ20/AQ40 to get some a handful of good pieces, and then you'll be set for Naxx. Well itemized dungeon blues or certain quest rewards will easily be able to substitute for raid gear (like the 2% crit trinket from Blackrock Spire) if you compensate with skill.<br />
<br />
Remember, 99% of raiders at the time were utter morons. People had never heard of theorycrafting, or even damage meters. Their talent trees were all over the place. They used abilities more or less at random. Addons were mostly QoL and not for performance. Not being afk and simply moving out of the fire while pressing 112112112 was enough to clear a raid for most people. LITERALLY.<br />
<br />
I remember some people at the time looked into how much skill matters, and there's some amazing results out there. People soloing dungeons at max level, or two-manning dungeons people went in with 10-man raid (like UBRS or Scholo). There was even a Molten Core raid with people in all green items, iirc. Stuff was hard only because people were new to things and utterly clueless. With modern, teched-out approaches to the game, the content will be OBLITERATED in no time. I wouldn't be surprised to see some of the truly hardcore guilds take out Nax within days of release.<br />

There were tons of reasons vanilla FELT more difficult, but from a modern perspective, it really wasn't. People just didn't know better. 10+ years of raiding experience compared to 1 year? Even the best players in the world back then weren't all that great by today's standards. It was mostly about showing up, and about farming what you needed to sustain your raiding. Playskill was secondary, because the average player skill was low - and that was fine, because the mechanics weren't as demanding as they are now.<br />

Understood, what i am saying is having websites, knowledge of fights, experience of raiding wont make it a walk in the park, sure once you have gear and resitance you have momentum but the get go is hard cause of the things you just specify, people are acting as if its gonna be LFR walk in the park <br />

I do expect it to be a walk in the park. Things like resistance gear etc. were actually more like crutches to compensate for bad plays. Once you got better a fight, you dropped more and more resistance gear, until you basically didn't use any at all. I remember that from both MC, Nax, and BT (Mother) vividly, where I had to reroll to a new class at the request of the guild and went in without resistance gear thinking it didn't matter if I died - only to find that I didn't.<br />
<br />
The obvious exception is the cloak for Nefarian, since the damage there is at ludicrous levels by design. It's more of an attunement.</div></div><hr />

Using 1.12 as a base is definitely news, though.

its really hard how you and the other posters above have not the slightest glue about what you talking. horrible.<br />

you cant go back to the old run animations on live. was never the case, since they were introduced, cause skel and rig are different.<br />

you cant switch back to old tauren model styles cause of high mountain taurens.<br />

4)<br />
same goes for every allied race that will added (i.e. orcs or dwarves in BfA).<br />
<br />
you can test that for yourself. make a tauren, click the checkbox. wohoo nothing happens. surprising...<br />
<br />
so, nearly no old model can be used any longer these days. <br />
<br />
or in short: you just talk shit and dont know what you are talking about.<br />
<br />
above user who wants all old models and run animations in classic is right. and i have the same oppinion here. for me one of the major points of classic is to not run bouncing up and down like an idiot and not have that manga idiotic models. todays style (especially running) is completely crap and hillarious in comparission with classic. so, thats a reason for some of us to play classic, and no, we „just can do this alrdy on life“... nooot.</div></div><hr />

Um, it's certainly not hard work to get blues from the dungeons, time consuming, yes, but not hard work. You can for sure jump from molten core to nefarian if the raid knows what they're doing.

That sort of naive player doesn't really exist anymore. You can get the old environment back, but you can't get the old people back. Bringing back vanilla WoW won't erase 10+ years of WoW experience from people's minds, and it won't make new players coming into the game into blank slates that had never touched an MMO before. 5-year olds play games now. The toothpaste is out of the tube, there's no squeezing it back in.<br />
<br />
ppl like you will have a hard time, when you are the first time in an classic raid. :) and realize that „some idiots“ dont interessted on min/max etc. will not easy peasy compensated.<br />
<br />
what do you ppl think ? that all ppl in that time were complete idiots ? that they cant learn ? that it took 2-3 years of classic to „understand“ mmorpg gaming and encounters ???<br />
<br />
wtf!</div></div><hr />

who cares about BLIZZARD THE OVERALL company as a wow player ? i dont hold shares of them...<br />
<br />
and why do i care about wasted resources on i.e. overwatch (or a new project, or whatever blizz do outside of wow) when i dont give a fuck about overwatch ? i dont care what resources they waste, when its not on wow. so your argument has the meaning of nothng for ppl only interessted in wow.</div></div><hr />

what are you gonna do? you gonna level a toon to 60? ok cool. you gonna raid with some people, get some kills, get some gear? then what? you're going to start bitching that its time to talk about a BC re-release. you people are choosing to take a literal step back in time instead of progressing a story. baffling to me.<br />

the ability/talents &quot;revamp&quot; from 1.12 may help make it easier i guess but it was never about the mechanics<br />
<br />
thats the truth. its about commitment. about farming stuff and gear. about min/max gear, talents, micromanagement. its old mmorpg style.<br />
<br />
that ppl that talk horrible BS here have never played it and never get that. they even dont realize that not all (nearly none) encounter at this time was a movement encounter. classic is completely about other topics.<br />
<br />
but if i had not played something and go talking yada yada yada about it, well, then i would sound that idiotic too.<br />

ppl that think lalalala we are the new players, we know everything, ppl in the old days were complete idiots, go into classic naxx and just quick run that stuff like lfr....<br />

wtf!<br />
As someone who actually raided during vanilla, yes, about 30 people per 40-man raid were bumbling idiots. But it didn't matter, because raids weren't difficult enough to demand bleeding-edge coordination and optimization to beat. It was about having fun, and ideas like &quot;hardcore&quot; or &quot;casual&quot; weren't exactly in everyone's minds at the time. Naxxramas was the first raid were things got noticeably more demanding, and that's contributed to its reputation - but it still wasn't anywhere near as difficult as modern raids, even &quot;just&quot; on heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
And looking back, even the great players in vanilla were far less skilled than they are now. Part of that has to do with the fact that they simply didn't have to be. There wasn't mythic raiding, where you messing up some small thing leads to an instant wipe. There weren't super-tight enrage timers or damage phases and so on, that demanded you min/max your character to the very last point if you want a WF kill. I played with the guys from Fury back on Stormrage, when they were the first to get kills in BWL. Those weren't hardcore gamers. There were people with their girlfriends, husbands and wives, just normal people who happened to have a bit more time on their hands than the average player, and who happened to know some people who had ambitions. You know how you got into top guilds back then? They needed a priest. They needed someone who can actually show up 4 nights a week. They needed someone who didn't mind farming Felwood for silly tubers. There were no logs, or rankings, or whatever.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it's impossible to have fun in classic these days. Far from it. But expect a lot of things to not turn out like you remembered, simply because the people who play it now aren't the same people who played 10 years ago, even if they actually played back then. And make no mistake: there will be ambitious raiders playing it as well, and absolutely WRECKING the classic raids. Not that that should necessarily diminish the fun for others. But it's just a reality that raids back then are lightyears behind modern raids.</div></div><hr />

i get it, you're mad because i'll end up right. look, i'm not here to argue with you about your 10th grade memories. i came along right after the beginning of BC. i got to hear the stories of running until level 40, only getting one or two epics at max level (which i do find that kind of cool, when every slot is purple or orange in the current build it does take away the cool factor of having something &quot;epic&quot;), and all the other shit that came with classic. <br />
<br />
i wonder why blizzard has decided to change EVERYTHING about the game from classic over the years. it's almost like they knew what they were doing...<br />

as far as my mmoc account time...what's your point? you sound silly.<br />

Newsflash mate. I never played Classic. I played FF11 at the time.<br />
<br />
The resources allocated are in no way affecting WoW. They made this quite clear. I'm not defending the Classic concept. They probably had a budget and idea ready for it after the whole thing involving the big server. No company puts all their funding in one basket. <br />
<br />
What we need is a reliable source backing up the claim that something else lost resources. What you consider a waste as well is highly subjective. They would not be doing it if they weren't confident about the project.<br />

The people being different is true, and I agree that is a major overlooked factor. Classic wow isn't going to be the semi-pop cultural event it was back then. You aren't likely going to have many fringe gamers, highschoolers, semi-interested boyfriends/girlfriends playing it. IMO those people added a lot of flavor to the game world that is going to be missed. Its going to be mostly older people, nerds, people who have done it all. The thrill of learning it, and teaching new players what to do will not be a big part of it like it was.<br />
<br />
On raids, for me the best part about old raiding was simply that there was only one version of each raid. Its way too fractured now. That alone will make raiding better than it is now imo.</div></div><hr />

Classic will allow people like you and me to experience the original game, that's fine. it will also allow younger people just getting into WoW to see the origins of the game. that's great. but i really foresee a couple years down the line a headline here or on the main website &quot;Classic Servers Closing.&quot; and that will happen because of the lack of players. <br />

Those aren't gameplay features. They are social and anti-cheat functionality.<br />
Cross-realm grouping (especially for dungeons) is also a social feature. Achievements (except for the few that give actual rewards) and unlocking transmogs in non-classic are also social features.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that it will be added - just that many changes can be sold as social features.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I understand and appreciate your decision to base Wow:Classic on 1.12.1, I think that you should come up with a way to introduce Vanilla content periodically, originally starting the game with no battlegrounds up and no Dire Maul up and with the only raids up being Molten Core and UBRS, the way it has been done in Vanilla private servers following Nostalrius closing down.<br />
<br />
E.g. Patch 1.4, patch 1.5, patch 1.6, patch 1.7, etc.<br />
<br />
When experienced this way, Vanilla content is even more fun and allows one to experience the whole game from start to finish.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
P.S: Thank you very much, I really appreciate you guys working on Classic and I can't wait to resub and play Classic again under Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

When your target audience is in the tens of millions and you can scale something like Classic to be cheap to maintain for just a few dozen thousand there's no real point in closing it down. There will always be a niche audience for this that will be large enough to sustain it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, that's not a shared experience. If I choose a player character, that should be the one everyone sees. Especially given how ludicrously different the modern models are than the older ones. If they had tried to port over everything perfectly instead of create a new vision, this line of reasoning might be kinda acceptable.<br />
<br />
New models is not vanilla. Period.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I would assume the main benefit is that different spells apply the same aura (i.e. sharing spell auras) - and that many spells only have aura or effect; but this example doesn't show that.<br />
<br />
I would assume the main benefit is that you are keeping only the stuff you need, at the cost of access time. If you make a single data structure that needs to remember everything, you end up with, like they showed, the fact that fireball has three auras, one of which is empty, and then it has three aura data points, one of which is periodic damage and two of which are nothing, and then it has three damage data points, two of which are populated and one of which is empty. In the other model, fireball has a reference to its damage and a reference to its periodic thing and then some termination concept, and then each of the damage and its dot has that value and nothing else. They probably made the change because they wanted to be able to decrease the memory weight of the database at the cost of a couple more references, and didn't keep support for the older model.<br />
<br />
I feel what they should be doing is adding in the support for the older model of thing so they can use the old data in place, because that's a truer emulation of the server side. But that's clearly not the direction they are going. This way should, in theory, work just as well, at higher initial effort cost.</div></div><hr />

The benefit is not about the number of entries. With the new tables you can share the same effects between spells, and(edited) have any number of effects per spell.<br />
This is just an example but basically there are properties that a DB should have to become better (more efficient to read, easier to expand..).<br />
<br />
Back in the early 2000s not all engineers knew or cared about DB design. Now it would be weird for a big company like Blizzard not to go for the objectively better solutions.<br />

I'm not denying the benefits of the new DB, just stating that the example doesn't show the benefit they claim relevant for 1.12 client: much less wasted space.<br />
<br />
If they wanted to show that spells share the effect - they could have shown two spells with the same aura, or if they wanted to show that the new way handles variable number of effects better they could have shown one spell with only damage - and no aura.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That means that the new data-base format isn't necessarily that beneficial for 1.12 WoW; but better supports updates and later versions.<br />
<br />
Another more interesting question is how can they use the fact that 1.12 could be in theory played in the same client as modern WoW. Time-walking would be one possibility.<br />
<br />
Another more interesting possibility is that during the cataclysm there was a change in the world data-base format as well (as far as I understand) - they have to convert that as well it seem, i.e. have a pre-cata world in a format usable by a modern client. And there are now multiple leveling paths; it seems that this could bring a rather obvious possibility: pre-cata leveling to 60 after BfA.</div></div><hr />

Why would a development team go through all that trouble, spend the time &amp; resources just for an &quot;I told you so&quot;? Do the people who demand for classic even hear the crazy conspiracies y'all overreact from every bit of classic WoW news?<br />
<br />
I'll say what I've always said since the announcement of classic WoW server: For me Vanilla was great because of the community back then, the sense of experiencing something new for the first time, you won't get that 1:1 experience you had when you first started playing this game a decade ago, with none of the aforementioned classic WoW was just a boring. Y'all can bring up how much more choices we had with talent trees back then all you want, but you know you'll end up following a meta build either way because that's want going to be the most efficient for whatever you are doing in-game.</div></div><hr />

Actually I realized I missed this in my earlier reply: the new tables don't allow you to share effects between spells (look more closely and you see why), however, as blizzard already noted it does allow you to have any number of effects per spell.<br />

I'm not claiming that you are wrong. However, Blizzard didn't make that claim - and their example doesn't indicate any reason why it would be true.<br />
<br />
I would also expect that hardware, and other software changes, during the last decade have increased stability and performance in a more significant way. <br />
However, part of those software changes are in the new WoW-version so it was probably easier to change DB-format than back-port the other changes.</div></div><hr />

It's not entirely impossible. One of the main motivations that they brought up, from the dev point of view, was to preserve the legacy of the game - so if it's just a &quot;look what we did back when&quot; kind of project, that a large company like Blizzard can afford, then why not make it free? It's not like once it's up and running they'll be making new content for it. <br />
<br />
I don't really have a horse in this race - if it's free, or paid, it's fine. I was never against them doing it, I get why people would be curious and try it - and I still maintain 6-8 months before the bulk of the new players go back to current WoW. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
I just laugh at the grandiose claims of the usual suspects - &quot;Classic will kill WoW!&quot; is about as meaningful as the predictions of doom WoW has gotten from day one - yet here it still is, actively being developed. The core of the classic server crowd here has been blowing things out of proportion for years, it's to be expected. They're expecting the whole world to stop spinning when it releases, because they think it's that important - the reality is, outside of their very small community, nobody is really that invested in it.<br />

Just to be that guy yet again, they have said repeatedly it's the data they don't have anymore, the numbers in the database. Most of the code for the client is there. There's a huge difference there.

As someone who actually raided during vanilla, yes, about 30 people per 40-man raid were bumbling idiots. But it didn't matter, because raids weren't difficult enough to demand bleeding-edge coordination and optimization to beat. It was about having fun, and ideas like &quot;hardcore&quot; or &quot;casual&quot; weren't exactly in everyone's minds at the time. Naxxramas was the first raid were things got noticeably more demanding, and that's contributed to its reputation - but it still wasn't anywhere near as difficult as modern raids, even &quot;just&quot; on heroic difficulty.<br />

I'm guessing you didn't go to the WoW forums during vanilla. &quot;Filthy casuals&quot; was born then - the &quot;Casual vs. Raid or Die&quot; war raged for all of vanilla. It's practically all the General forums talked about - and then the fits of rage with TBC when Blizzard admitted Raid Or Die didn't really work, and were actively supporting casual players AND &quot;hardcore&quot; raiders. I distinctly remember whole threads of people saying &quot;filthy casuals&quot; didn't deserve drops - at all - including stuff off trash and open world mobs. To say it wasn't in anyone's mind is hysterical, but you ran face first into it in the forums, on websites, and in chat in the game. You couldn't escape it! <br />
<br />
I really wish there were archives of the first year of General Chat from the WOW site. It paints a completely different picture from what a lot of people claim happened back then.</div></div><hr />

And even then, it took a while. I don't remember doing the whole place in one run, because it took so long. Getting to the Princess was the point.<br />
<br />
I didn't run the live side of Strat until nearly the end of vanilla, because nobody wanted to run it, because it took too long, and the drops weren't that good.<br />
<br />
You couldn't really even do the whole place in one run. The level difference between bosses made sure of that (on top of miss% because of needing more +hit on higher level enemies). <br />
<br />
You ran a wing of mara every couple of levels, and when you were high enough for Princess, you were not about to do the wing with the Satyrs because the gear it dropped was on par with your greens anyway (and the blue for finishing the last quest).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koward</div><div class="date">2018-06-17, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I realized I missed this in my earlier reply: the new tables don't allow you to share effects between spells (look more closely and you see why), however, as blizzard already noted it does allow you to have any number of effects per spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Indeed, I read too fast and missed their SpellID columns. At first glance I though Spell Effects was a raw list of effects and that they had some other relation to link them with spell.<br />
Mmm, that means two spells using identical Damage effects with the same parameters (and I just checked the actual tables, there are quite a lot) would have duplicate entries with just the SpellID that differs. I wonder if there's an advantage to that, I don't see it. Still better than vanilla anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
You know can revert to the old busted looking models in the current game right?<br />
<br />
The animations were removed around something like 6.1 (it was the patch that fixed a bit Night Elf models, but I do not remember which one exactly) so that even old models use the new skeletons. And nowadays, even the old models are not accessible for some races (at least elves and taurens I think).</div></div><hr />
