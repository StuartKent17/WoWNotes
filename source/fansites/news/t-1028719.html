Future Blizzcon Plans<br />
Blizzard recently sent out an email to everyone who purchased the Virtual Ticket with hints of what they are considering for future years. If you ordered the Virtual Ticket and have not provided feedback yet, check your email for your survey link.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 4.3: Raid Finder Loot Rules<br />
As previously announced the Raid Finder will use an altered version of Need Before Greed that provides loot roll bonuses to those that have entered the raid in the role (tank, DPS, healing) that uses those items. Unfortunately the system is currently unable to detect spec, and so this creates some issues for classes that utilize stats that are not &quot;common&quot; to that role.<br />
<br />
To help clarify which items you will or will not be able to roll on based on the role you entered the raid in, we have some basic guidelines that we've followed that should help you anticipate which items you'll receive the roll bonus on.<br />
<br />
If you're in a raid as one of the below roles here is what you'll receive a roll bonus on:<br />
<br />
Tank:<br />
Agility Leather (for druids)<br />
Strength plate with tank stats on it<br />
Trinkets with tank stats<br />
Trinkets with Agility (for druids)<br />
<br />
Healer:<br />
Any appropriate caster gear without Hit<br />
Trinkets that trigger on heals or beneficial spells<br />
<br />
DPS:<br />
Mostly everything that doesn’t have a tank stat on it<br />
Spirit gear (for elemental shaman, shadow priest, and moonkin)<br />
Trinkets that trigger on damaging spells/melee hits<br />
<br />
In some cases we've been overly restrictive when flagging accessories (Petrified Fungal Heart and Signet of Grasping Mouths in particular), and we're planning to modify a couple of those items to be less restrictive before or shortly after the patch goes live.<br />
<br />
With Mists of Pandaria our expectation is that we will have the ability to detect spec, and so all of these issues go away for future raids. For Dragon Soul there will be some overlap, though, and it's important you're aware of the loot rules as due to the automated distribution system our support department will not be able to assist with any loot disputes while using Raid Finder. <br />

the only reason it's got a 45% boost to sinister strike is because it's a dagger instead of a slower weapon. it'd hit like a wet noodle otherwise.</div></div><hr />

At the same time, I bet it feels like it suits the commercial. That's why I consider it interesting. Anyway, props to Blizz for double commercials.

<br />
yer, there are many druid tanks out there. It's rather unlikely you'll get a Paladin/Warrior Warrior/DK or DK/Paladin comb. Mhm, poor rogues and hunters and feral dps and enhance shamans (you forgot those two). You could also say that Feral tanks are getting screwed since they have to roll against dps feral druids and rogues for leather pieces, and the mentioned 4 for trinkets, whereas warriors/dks/paladins will have to roll each other out instead. Get over it to be honest :P <br />
<br />
Man, it really doesn't matter that much. It depends on the other proc the trinket has, it's unlikely a hunter wants an agi trinket that procs dodge or has a use of an absorb or triggers armor. Just wait and see.<br />
<br />
You could say the same for shadow priests/elemental shamans/moonkins, they can need on spirit gear! :O!! So meaaannn! Can't help it that a Spirit/Haste gearpiece might be their BiS before normal/heroic raiding gear. <br />

Which means Agi Leather drops. Rogue rolls 1-100 +100 and I roll 1-100 +100. I'm okey with this, its fair. But what about stuff thats not caught under the &quot;tank-category&quot;?Necks, rings, relics and weapons?Staff of the awesome agility drops.Hunter rolls 1-100 +100.

use full sentences, completely unreadable.<br />
<br />
on topic: Healers get a bonus on Spirit gear, just like shadowpriests, moonkins and elemental shamans. Why ? Because the gear is just as usefull for them too. A spirit/haste Necklace is good for all those classes, just like the mace or off-hand for example in Firelands. BiS is BiS and I'm not going to pass to a healer in LFR because of that.<br />
<br />
As a result of this, shadowpriests, moonkins and ele shamans are easier to gear up than other dps'ers and healers rolling on Intellect gear. <br />
Is it a problem ? No. LFR is there to assist in gearing up. It's not the final stop. The real raids are. You'll replace the gear you get fast enough (I hope)<br />
<br />
Blood Dk's will get a roll bonus on 2-handers with Mastery on. They SHOULDN'T get it on a weapon without mastery on it.<br />
<br />
Druid tanks will get a roll bonus on the 2 Agility trinkets and on the 2 Tanking trinkets. But Agility IS a good stat for Druid tanks and they may end up using it if they need more dodge for example. Or they may need it for their Feral OS.. It's just LFR level, see above...<br />
<br />
I don't like that they didn't bother to fix the issue of Shaman and Druid dps'ers being able to roll on almost everything. If you're an Enhancement shaman, you sign as DPS but you get a roll bonus for all Intellect gear too ! Same for Druids. Would have been easily fixed with instead of choosing dps, having to choose Ranged and Melee DPS but Blizzard has chosen to not implement that and instead ignore the incoming QQ about that.</div></div><hr />

It does NOT have dodge or parry on it, that means it's a DPS item.<br />
<br />
Both tanks and dps will get a roll bonus on that item.<br />
<br />
Not all stats are relevant. Only what distinguishes them from other stats. Mastery, Dodge and Parry.<br />
Just like Hit, Spirit or none of them distinguishes for Healers and DPS casters.<br />
<br />
It may not be a BiS item, but it's the tank's or dps's choice to Need it and use it.<br />

I thought it would be quite amazing if Blizzard teamed up with someone like OnLive, and allowed us to play the games online. Blizzard's biggest worry would probably be their game getting out. So, they would need some way to ensure that someone at OnLive wouldn't leak the game demo.</div></div><hr />

She does impressions and her monotone voice isn't her real voice, it's the voice she uses in Parks and Recreations. She is WAY above-average, I don't know what girls you see where you live but none of them look like her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They need to be tough on ninjas with the system as it presently stands otherwise you will get resto druids ior shammies needing on agility stuff for their off spec and then just leaving the group. Hell, a mage who is a plank could need on a haste trinket with an agility proc because of the haste. He may get kicked but it could be 5 or 6 more runs before it drops again and 15 before you win the roll.<br />
<br />
It's going to be tough enough to win stuff going forward with the number of people rolling on anything and everything that they can. Thats how it was in the Zand dungeons in the beginning.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't spirit becoming even more important for healers? As in: our complete regen will be based on our spirit and intellect won't have any influence on that anymore.<br />
We should get as much, if it isn't more, bonus on our rolls on spirit items.<br />

<br />
You are misreading it. It says that druid tanks would get a roll bonus on the trinket, AS WELL AS dps. Non-druid tanks would not get a roll bonus. It's pretty obvious that rogues/hunters would also get a roll bonus - next time maybe reread things with the mindset that you may be misinterpreting things rather than rushing to teh interwebs to register your outrage.</div></div><hr />

no, comparing amongst only the tank classes, Druids are screwed. Plate tanks will compete with only the other tank in LFR. 2 possible rolls for gear.<br />
<br />
Bears will compete with kitties (all), Rogues (leather, jewelery, trinkets), Enh shamans (jewelery, trinkets), hunters (jewelery, trinkets, weapon) for gear.<br />
Not to mention nearly all the DS leather gear has haste on it, a crap stat for bears.<br />
<br />
only DK's amonst the tanks have to compete with a DPS for gear (2h weapons, with warriors, Rets and DKs)<br />
<br />
LFR has to be one of the biggest slap-in-the-face moves to bear tanks so far.<br />

So you cant trade it to other people. It would prevent people rolling on their friends item. Even though you might have traded a lot of gear in the past year (with the 2 hours timer).
