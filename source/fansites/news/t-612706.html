<br />
Content Patch Before Wrath of the Lich King<br />
With the release of Wrath of the Lich King approaching, we wanted to provide you with some important information. In preparation for the expansion, we will be issuing a new content patch in the coming weeks. Much like the patch made available shortly before The Burning Crusade's release, this content patch is designed to bridge current game content with that of the expansion and will contain some exciting changes and additions.<br />
<br />
We have outlined some of the larger features scheduled to release with the patch below:<br />
<br />
New class spells and talents<br />
Stormwind Harbor<br />
Barbershops in capital cities<br />
Zeppelin towers outside of Orgrimmar and Tirisfal Glades<br />
Two brand-new Arenas featuring challenging new layouts, terrain hazards, and moving obstacles<br />
Guild calendar<br />
Hunter pet skill revamp<br />
New profession: Inscription<br />
<br />
As mentioned above, this is not a comprehensive list, just some of the major highlights. We’ll post the full patch notes as soon as they’re available. Regarding Inscription, please note that all Burning Crusade players will be able to select Inscription as one of their two professions and level up to a skill level of 375 with it. Upon the release of Wrath of the Lich King, players who purchase and install the expansion will be able to continue leveling in Inscription and the other professions beyond 375. <br />
<br />
Wrath of the Lich King Arenas<br />
Preview of Season .. 5 ? Arena rewards from beta servers : LK Arena 2 2H Mace (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/august/arena2_2hmace.jpg)<br />
We want to provide some information about the direction of the Arena system. Upon the release of Wrath of the Lich King, players will find they are still able to access the Arena system at level 70 for rated matches. Those competing in the Arenas at 70 will still be able to attain items using Arena points and rankings; however, we do not currently plan to offer new items or titles for this bracket. Players who level past 70 will have their Arena points reset to 0 and be removed from all Arena teams in the level-70 bracket.<br />
<br />
Two new skirmish brackets (71-75, 76-80) will be available for players who wish to hone their Arena skills while leveling in Northrend. Those who reach level 80 will once again have the opportunity to create new Arena teams and play in rated matches once a new season starts. New items, titles, and end-of-season rewards will be offered to the most successful teams at level 80. Additionally, the sets released for the Arenas in Wrath of the Lich King will no longer share aesthetic similarities with tiered raiding gear. We want those equipped with the best PvP rewards and those with the best raiding sets to stand out from each other. Players at level 80 will also have the opportunity to compete in two new Arenas featuring challenging new layouts, terrain hazards, and moving obstacles. <br />

<br />
Having said that bring on warhammer! It seams all the 'less desireables' are going there and will make my wrath much nicer.<br />
<br />
In more releated news, as a shadow priest I'm not 100% looking forward to this patch as it will gut my raiding with 3% less mana and massive hit shortage.<br />
<br />
<br />
WArhammer online is terrific and very well polished at this stage. I played debacle that was Age of Conan and I will say that WAR blows that game out of the war with class balance, PVP, and ease of play. I think mythic achieved everything they aimed for and I look forward to its release on sept. 18th.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While your experience involves nothing but standing idle in a capitol city, my experience is much more diverse. I find myself doing battlegrounds, running dungeons, fighting in arena, hunting my sworn enemies(griefers:P), doing quests, gathering reputation, doing holiday-specific tasks, playing on alts, etc. I also enjoy goofing around with my girlfriend wherever we may go, putting on some rp equipment and having fun:P<br />
<br />
You see, when I'm done with arena/battlegrounds for the week I do other stuff. Thats what I did when I raided as well. I have rarely been idle because I always find something to do. Why you can't find anything else to do I don't know. I'm not trying to be rude by saying you play the game wrong or anything, I just wanted to point out that some do find other stuff to do:)<br />
<br />
And on the subject of Warhammer, I will try it out. I don't know if I'll stick with it though, since I don't like the idea of RvR. I feel WoW is restricted because of the two factions and making it so that they are not even in the same world seems like an immersion breaker to me. FFA is what I enjoy the most since it gives me the feeling of realistic warfare and a living world. But people prefer different things.</div></div><hr />

And I bet you'll get bored eventually just attack or defending your land, WAR seems like a big scale old school AV. I haven't heard anything about what happends when the capital city boss dies, respawn and do it again?</div></div><hr />

yes they look similar &amp; thats it<br />
&amp; dont forget once upon a time everquest wore the crown for undisputed mmorpg champ now where is it?<br />
i say good on mythic for doing warhammer it has rich lore-inovated game ideas &amp; it brings full scale pvp too<br />
remember guys n gals competition is good it keeps blizz on their toes which is good for us ie the customers ;)<br />
so dont judge aor till its out-then try it &amp; say its great omfg or wtf i hate it. <br />
i bet content patch sept &amp; remember blizz said the 5th of when its ready so i put money on oct<br />
just my thoughts</div></div><hr />

WHAT? They haven't done anything at all for Rogues, shamans and many other classes and they're already talking about releasing some content in a few weeks? Blizzard better work extremely fast or maybe they'll just implant NYI skills.</div></div><hr />

Well, I think they intended it to say &quot;sooner than you thought.&quot; Otherwise, they would have used the phrase &quot;in the coming months.&quot;<br />

Methinks they actually do want to counter Warhammer. I thought they were going to be content to ignore it as they did with AoC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Why, exactly, would any of it need to be tested and balanced for level 80 when the patch we're talking about would still have a level 70 cap? They can release that patch and keep the Wrath Beta active for testing level 80, you know...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You gotta have a hell of a computer to play Age of Conan, the reason why people are not sticking to it. I played WAR this week end and i gotta say, this game is REAL COMPETITION to wow... and don't get me wrong, i'm a wow lover all the way. But i was really impressed with WAR and how smooth the game was. Goblin shaman FTW!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seref</div><div class="date">2008-08-26, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">they didn't balance them to 77...<br />
<br />
they said they were waiting for level 80 to even BEGIN balancing...<br />
thats why some classes were doing insane amounts of dps(ret) and some weren't doing as much.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borntrue</div><div class="date">2008-08-26, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure you'll see players with new talents but i bet they will respec back to the lvl 70 raiding spec instead of the new ones. <br />
<br />
May i just say that this comment is not true for all classes , I can only speak for warlocks but it is not possible to spec DS/destro (shadow) with the new talent trees with only 71 points, infact it is not really possible to spec DS/destro (shadow) atall.<br />
<br />
So it's going to be a weakend version of Imp Destro (fire) or a hybrid close to the old SM/Ruin builds from what i can work out anyway.<br />
<br />
Any ideas for level 70 specs with Wotlk talents ? Lets see what ur gonna try :)</div></div><hr />

I think it's awesome that Inscription is being given up to 375 without even having to buy the xpac.<br />

If someone is bored of WoW and they want to play something else then good for them. What's it matter? It's just a game... move on.<br />

<br />
First off, about Warhammer.<br />
<br />
Yes I've been in the closed beta and even on preview weekend (3 days) I reached lvl 21 and had my mount on the last night for a few hours. Anyway, Warhammer is a very well made game, it's got it's bugs, but If you played warcraft beta you know we had alot there too. You are able to compare warhammer and warcraft very easily, but they are totally different games. As a hardcore raider and a fairly decent pvper I very much enjoy playing Warhammer, there are alot of things in which I think Warcraft should implement (that would even fit into lore) that Warhammer has done pre-launch. They are both very good games and I could honestly see myself playing both If I wasn't a hardcore raider that wants to go somewhere in wrath.<br />
<br />
Now about the talents being released and the upcoming release of the xpac.<br />
<br />
I do believe the TBC talents were released roughly 1 month before TBC itself, and I see the same falling true for Wrath. The reason for this is they want people to test out the new talents a bit more before release and they want to give people the time to get inscription up to 375 and many other things. Now with that being said, my personal belief is such.<br />
<br />
Warhammer comes out Sept 18th.<br />
Blizzard will release new talents and such at the end of Sept or very beginning of Oct. This will allow 1 month before my expected release date of Nov 5th (they already gave us the &quot;5th&quot; hint).<br />
<br />
On 1 more note, I'm VERY VERY VERY excited that they will be differentiating between PVP and PVE gear, because that was a pet-peeve of mine, if I'm in T6, I don't want the S4 guy to look like me, because I havn't achieved what he has and he hasn't achieved what I have.</div></div><hr />

Up to this point, Blizzard claimed that they will (most likely) not release a patch before WoTLK unless there will be a delay with the expansion itself. This news, for me at least, confirms that we will probably not see the expansion until really late this year, or early next year. But at least we'll get to play around with the new talents on live as well, which is good :) <br />

I didn't read anything like that. From what I've read, they've always planned to release a similar to pre-bc patch before Wrath. A bridge patch is very useful, and helps inch people into the expansion, it's almost necessary. Don't worry, with the resources and man-power Blizzard has, they will no doubt shoot out a completed expansion very soon.</div></div><hr />

Edit: After a quick search I found this interview. http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=7361.0 --&gt; Scroll down for &quot;Patch 2.5?&quot; I'm sure I read a blue post that was specifically saying that unless there will be a delay, they don't plan to make such a patch :) Anyway, off to work, see you later :)</div></div><hr />

<br />

They meant there would not be another patch with additional TBC content.<br />
A bridge patch that introduces features of WotLK is something different.</div></div><hr />

It will most likely be around a month before the release of Wotlk and after the talents and skills are 99% finalized. As soon as all the classes had their balancing attention and those loooong class changes compilations here on mmo-champion are getting shorter and shorter and only deal with very minor things you can start hoping for the patch. But I would be very suprised if that was any time before late October</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The public 2.0 patch was released 5 weeks before TBC, rogues talent has Cloack of Shadow as 41 Sub tree... When TBC hits live server, CoS was a level 66 skill. Patch bridge talents =/= LK release talents !!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also I think every one in the game is getting bored/aggitiated with the current game. The new talents will be fun. Straight up wtf fun. Yes there will be bugs, things will be op. Guess what? NOTHING IS PERFECT. Unless you just hit 70 and started raiding/pvping I seriously doubt you are still having oodles of fun. You may very well be. Though there is a lot of people who are bored.<br />
<br />
When I hear, or read, about people talking about what will kill WoW. It seems like their world is going to end if WoW isn't exactly what they want. What game will be better, what game will offer more kewl stuff, what will be balanced, etc and so forth. Look at it this way; What game will be the most FUN for you? Let us remember this is still a game. That is a huge problem with most WoW players I meet. Its like a job. No its a game. Treat it as one. If it is not fun, don't play it.<br />
<br />
As to the people talking about when. Well they said in the coming weeks, not months. Don't try to read into what they have said. Simply read what they said. If they change their plans, they change them. Right now they said weeks. 2-3 weeks max till it comes out.<br />
<br />
Personally I am quite excited. Every one I play with is excited. Its new, that is the biggest thing for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Balancing, who cares? Wrath is coming out, they don't care about balancing right now. Hell they opened up BT/Hyjal for every one who can get ZA/Badge gear.<br />
<br />
TBC is over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You install that, get access to some WOTLK stuff but not all. The rest just sits there waiting for release.<br />
<br />
They may then release another couple of smaller patches prior to release. Once release day hits, you just have to enter your CD key on the website and you pretty much hit the ground running. No lengthy install process, as you already have the content on your PC.<br />
<br />
That's how I remember it with BC. One of the pre-release patches for BC was 600mb and that was all the new maps and models. It wouldn't surprise me if this WOTLK pre-patch is also of the 600mb+ mark.<br />
<br />
Either way, it's good news and seems to suggest November is looking promising.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So Badge of Justice should be the currency to buy 80 epics too?<br />
I will get 5000 arena points and 75k honor / 100x4 marks.<br />
But still, its not fair at all. New players will have nothing at 80 and old players who PVP much will have tons of gear day 1. Not fun to play vs us who got max saved arena/honor.<br />
<br />
Reset Arena and Honor points + marks imo. Then all start on square one = fair. An alternative would be to raise the cap to 10 000 / 150 000 or so. But i still prefer the reset even though i would get a huge boost if they dont.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bogus comparisons FTW! The current badges of justice will be replaced by new badges for level 80 gear, so if you had 500 badges of justice saved, at level 80 you'd be able to buy 500 badges worth of level 70 gear. If you kept your 5000 Arena points you'd be able to level to 80 and instantly buy a bunch of level 80 Arena purples and instantly outgear everyone who didn't have Arena points saved. Maybe a little imba yes? But then I guess not being able to wave your epeen about earlier than everyone else is what's got you upset. Just spend your points on level 70 Arena gear before you start levelling ffs.</div></div><hr />

and how i understand it u can still arena at 70 to your hearts content but u will only be able to do that as long as ur 70 and u go any farther u will be reset. not sure if this is for arenas and honor or just arenas so u cant save ur points up to just buy the gear when u hit 80 sorry to all those who thought differently.</div></div><hr />

Well, we are not talking about a 2.5 patch here, but most likely a 3.0. A 2.5 patch would be further changes/content added to the Burning Crusade, while the 3.0 is simply a patch made to test the woltk stuff on the live servers :)</div></div><hr />

actually thats a good thing, TBC was plagued with arena weapons being alot better then pve weapons, yust look at the one handed swords for rogues, they are simply the best ingame for them. <br />
<br />
Might be true you'll see PvErs now going in with there PvE weapons in arena, but remember, the diffrence in resillence needed will be much higher, you'll see PvE people be punished alot more with using them in sense of resillence.<br />
<br />

From what I've heard from my dev bud as well as some other people, the dev team has a different build than what the beta testers do. He's been saying that druids (and I think pallies) are getting their big ol' focused patch next, and locks are to follow. If the devs really are ahead of us, which I'd bet my last 30g they are, druids (and I think pallies, it's late and I can't remember for sure) are already done and they're working on locks (bout time imo, though I do feel for the Rogues out there), so that just leaves rogues and maybe another class or so for major stuff.<br />

Might be true you'll see PvErs now going in with there PvE weapons in arena, but remember, the diffrence in resillence needed will be much higher, you'll see PvE people be punished alot more with using them in sense of resillence.<br />
<br />
fair for PvE players to PvP for better items? i think not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well PVP gear is always gonna benefit PVE in someway and PVE gear is always gonna benefit PVP but if you want to PVP the PVP gear should the THE best gear. If you want PVE the PVE gear should be the BEST gear.<br />
<br />
PVE cant just go and get S4 weapons since they need 2050 rating so not like they just go buy them. Just like PVP guys dont kill Illidan for Warglaives so easy.<br />
<br />
Ofc the best PVE swords should be far better for PVE then PVP sword. Just as PVP swords should be better for PVP then PVE swords. <br />
<br />
But DPS is the wrong way to go, keep DPS the same but use more sta/resil on PVP gear and more Hit/AP/Crit in PVE gear. <br />
<br />
About resil, get PVE weap and put a resil gem. Then you get imba DPS weapon and same resil.<br />
<br />
There is one exception i can agree and that would be legendary items.</div></div><hr />

As PvE player you have a guild that raids and can kill mobs like illidan easier than a PvP oriented person with a small PvP guild. I doubt that the PvP player will ever see Illidan but the PvE player just needs to play 10 Arena games and get the points. I am talking about people who have the same time and skill so the rating is meaingless.<br />
Yes in Wrath you can raid in 10 or 25 man setup but in 10 man you wont see the mace...</div></div><hr />

They'd just increase the cap, or add a new faction.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, it's kind weird actually.<br />
They are punishing all the players who got 5000 arena points right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, never saw they deleting my arena points when TBC came out and I leveled to lvl 61...&quot;<br />
<br />
How you say that if arena only exists after TBC came out and never had a level cap increase in the middle of its seasons?<br />
<br />
It's totally insane that you grab arena points at 70 to buy 80 gear... why not save your T4,T5,T6 tokens to change for T7,T8,T9 when you just hit 80?<br />
<br />
The only thing that is weird is removing the player from the team and the need to create a new one. Why not just put the 70+ player non elegible for lvl 70 arena matches and create a separate team rank for lvl 80 matches? Maybe the teams/ranks will get a little bit confused or their system won't allow it without a huuuuuge (and unecessary just to save some gold) modification...<br />
<br />
But really, punishing? Why? It would punish, in fact, every other player who can't use lvl 70 tokens to buy lvl 80 stuff right out of the bat. They're not taking it from you, you're removing yourself from the lvl 70 league.<br />
<br />
Honor is honor, reputation is reputation, achievements are achievements... arena is another stuff, it's a competition between lvl 70s that will be over, you'll start a new competition/league at lvl 80. And remember, arena is controled by Goblins, you shouldn't ever expect a goblin to not be greedy.<br />
<br />
The faction wars and the friends you made (rep), won't get diminished or diferent because you hit a new level. Everyone will still be fighting for AV at lvl 80. So your Honor will still be Honor (wich used to be ranks).<br />
<br />
PvE players will have to farm everything again for lvl 80, so go play arena again at 80 for well deserved lvl 80 gear. :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah sure less Stamina and Resilience, but it doesnt matter when u only get hit once before u killed one guy. Its good with PVE gear in arena today and if its gonna be like this its gonna be even worse. Unless they make a huge change to Resilience or Stamina or something else.</div></div><hr />

Well either PvP gear makes the 10-man raid progression completely trivial, or the 25-man raid gear (weapons) is better than the PvP counterparts. Those are pretty much the two options you have.<br />
<br />
In either case, raid gear is about doing lots of steady damage, PvP gear is about survival over damage output. Pound for pound, PvP gear should be inferior at pure dps to raid gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm...have we been playing the same beta? Warhammer is not what I would call polished in the least. As an animator working in the field I find some of their character animations to be down right offensive to my senses. The classes are NOT balanced and frankly the overall experience lacks any depth. Its great if you like the mindless hack/slash sort of thing maybe...but everything I've seen from the warcraft xpac is twice as fun and will no doubt keep me playing for a while yet.</div></div><hr />

Can you give more details, or are you posting in another thread perhaps? I've been looking for some opinion like this. No one seems to be saying bad or good things about WOTLK. I'm sorta hoping that's a good sign rather than bad.</div></div><hr />

The new instances are drop-dead gorgeous, perfect length, and really fun twists.<br />

Looking forward to the even though, I'm totally going to ditch work for it I'm sure. WOTLK has had a much more epic, and WoW like feeling for me than BC.

No its not, Lots of Sta/Resil for PVP, AP/Haste/Hit/Crit on PVE.<br />

Yes PVE should be better for PVE and PVP better for PVP, thats why we need balance and DPS on weapon is the wrong way to go. Just boost AP/Haste/Hit/Crit on PVE gear and Sta/Resil on PVP gear not +15 DPS on weapon...<br />
<br />
4xT6 / 4xBrutal Rogues are already INSANE in arena (even after cheat death change). This is just making it worse.<br />
<br />
And PVE guys still need 2050 rating to get the weapons + points. Btw make it 20 or 30 games per week so it takes more time? Alot of PVE guys seem to dislike 10 games for points.</div></div><hr />

Beta will last for a good 2+ months from its current state (we've only been in beta for close to 5 weeks), and we're definitely not in the &quot;few weeks&quot; range. <br />
<br />
<br />
Consider the time TBC was in beta before it went into patch 2.0 and that included less changes than wotlk. Also &quot;the coming weeks&quot; is a referrence to something a lot closer than 2 months away. Looking at the past once the talents went 2.0 they pretty much stayed that way all the way into live, which isnt exactly satisfying at the moment, also i think its a mistake to force themselves into a reduced timeline. And we all know the kind of &quot;constructive, mature, considerate feedback&quot; that we see on live servers compared to beta ones. The moment someone points out something isnt working 10.000 &quot;you whine blablabla its fine l2p&quot; posts jump in, preventing a constructive conversation about what changes are needed and how to fix what is broken. In my opinion and experience, blizzard are shooting themselves in the foot with this, and the quality we can expect from the finished product thus also takes a blow. <br />
<br />
If you want more to test, send out more beta invites or go into open beta, it doesnt lock yourself on the path to the same degree this kind of thing does.<br />
<br />
@Schnitzel: But you seem to forget they first need to test those big patches and then fix them and patch them again, then apply changes ect. Releasing the &quot;big patch&quot; for the classes isnt the final step, its the first step of the process, so every time they release a big patch, they also need weeks to then patch the fixes to the patch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">larsson</div><div class="date">2008-08-26, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a raider, I love the crying from arena people who think 1 hour a week with a cookie cutter arena group should always get the same item level as a 25 man 12+ hours a week, loot not guaranteed raid group. I for one love the fact that 25 man weapons will always be higher than 10 man/arena.<br />
<br />
Item quality should be based on both skill and time invested. While some arena people have skill (I don't mean the arms warrior retards who get high rating thinking mortal strike, hamstring and intercept is all they need to do) the time invested is no where near 25 mans and yes I felt the badge system had too low requirements on the 't6 level' stuff (should have been 150-200 badges an item). With little real effort I have an alt tank who can easily tank most of black temple/mount hyjal (not just be.imba crap I've tried it in game).<br />
<br />
<br />
Well its not fast to farm full Guardian + trinkets + Brutal. Sure not random drop on a boss but lots of time to get every piece. Yes i agree PVE takes more time but its not free in PVP either. And sure make it 20-30 games per week to get arena points, fair change imo.<br />
<br />
And you need 2050 rating to get weapons, not free for every1 + u dont get many points per week in 1500.<br />
<br />
So PVP is easy but PVE is not? Sure there is good team combos in PVP. But Warr/Druid vs Warr/Druid should be fair right? Its &quot;quite&quot; fair in the long run.<br />
<br />
And its not like PVE is rocket science, dont tell me its hard to keep SnD up, rupture and keep using Cooldowns in PVE, i never did much PVE but damn it was easy compared to PVP. Both take lots of time even tho PVE take more time and is harder to control since u just cant logout.<br />
<br />
But to my original point. Is it fair that 25man raiders = top rated arena guys? Very funny for us PVP guys who dont touch PVE (raiding and dungeons).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kittynipples</div><div class="date">2008-08-26, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No its not, Lots of Sta/Resil for PVP, AP/Haste/Hit/Crit on PVE.<br />

<br />
<br />
So the PvE Weaps will still be the superior damage weapons. Their advantage just isn't in upfront dps.<br />
<br />
And quite frankly, if you've managed to not only do all the arenas and gotten the rating to wear the PvP gear PLUS you've found the time to also do the 25-man raid to get the weapon, you should have an advantage over the people who do nothing but sit in Dalaran queuing for the next match.<br />

The raid encounters are not too terribly difficult once you learn what you are supposed to do. Getting 24 other people to not be morons and pay attention to what is going on so that you can actually beat them is a bit more challenging. In a 25 man raid, all it takes is one person to cause a wipe.</div></div><hr />

E vola, weapons which are rather useless for PvE, but quite good in arenas.<br />
<br />
The only problem there would be what to do with healer &quot;weapons&quot; since ignoring resilence isn't really that important to them, at least compared to a dps class. Maybe a chance to ignore healing reduction debuffs, but that again is a bit situational.<br />
<br />
<br />
The main problem of the PvE-PvP item of BC WoW is the time investment. If you can choose between spending 20 hours in arenas to get the points &amp; rating for a weapon or spending 40 hours in raids to get the dkp and boss progression *and* loot luck for a weapon...well. Even if the PvE weapon is marginally better the PvP one is effort/effect the &quot;smarter&quot; choice. For PvE.</div></div><hr />

Warhammer will fail, just like AoC. I wanted to believe another game would be a greater success but I played AoC in hopes of it being better and all that happened was I wasted money. WoW FTW.</div></div><hr />
