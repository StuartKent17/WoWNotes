On a sidenote, it seems that a lot of people used the old talent calculator yesterday. It was updated automatically but the only reliable Cataclysm calculator you should use is http://wowtal.com (http://wowtal.com). The old one doesn't have prereqs and make most of your builds useless. (The old talent calc only stays around for 3.3.5 Live builds)<br />
<br />
<br />
Pet Classes - &quot;Move To&quot; Command<br />
A new action has been added to the Pet bar in the latest beta build. You can now order your pet to Move to a targeted location and stay there.<br />

Developer Chat on Twitter -- 7.16.10<br />
We will be holding our next developer chat on Twitter on Friday, July 16, at 5:00 p.m. PDT with World of Warcraft's systems design team. This chat session will focus on the recently-announced talent specialization and Mastery system changes coming in Cataclysm: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=25626290449&amp;sid=1<br />
<br />
We'll be taking questions live through Twitter, so be sure to sign up for a Twitter account at https://twitter.com/signup and follow @Warcraft to participate.<br />
<br />
To submit a question for the developer chat, please tweet using the #BlizzChat hashtag between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. PDT on July 16. Due to Twitter's character limitations, all answers will be posted in a dedicated thread on the World of Warcraft forums. <br />

Blue posts<br />
A typical day @ Blizzard<br />
Most of the day is spent in communication of some sort. We'll have formal meetings where we review a current talent tree. We have just tons and tons of discussions of &quot;Hey, guys, I had an idea,&quot; or &quot;Hey, I can't solve this problem. Any thoughts?&quot; We do work quite closely with the programmers implementing things like the new talent UI or the new scaling spell model. We also work closely with the artists coming up with new spell visuals. Our QA department is constantly trying to sort through what the design of the moment is, and they do a great job of triaging the totally broken things from the &quot;fix this before we ship&quot; things. The community team brings us concerns that they have seen on the forums or from their interactions with players. This is particularly true for the non-English forums, because my non-English for one is sadly lacking. History geek that I am, I studied Ancient Greek in college, which serves me about as well in day to day life as you probably imagine.<br />
<br />
GC's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan. He speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom. He'll blend in -- disappear -- you'll never see him again. With any luck... he's got the Grail already.<br />
<br />
GC: Does anyone here speak English? Or even Ancient Greek?<br />
<br />
There aren't many typical days. Sometimes we will spend literally hours discussing one problem. The last few days it has been the paladin rotations. We'll throw things on white boards, send out some ideas to guys not actually in the office, try out some stuff in game to see how it feels, and get feedback from anyone who has recently run one of the new dungeons or tried a new BG. We interact a lot with the community outside of the building, visibly on forums like this one, but through email, IRC and even in game. There are a lot of excellent PvP and PvE players with whom I regularly correspond, and I want to call out any of you reading this and thank you publically.<br />
<br />
Overall the environment is very collaborative. The team as a whole (by which I mean the artists, programmers, producers and everyone else) don't get enough credit for the design decisions that go into the game. In many cases, my guys are just the implementers, but the ideas and feedback come from everyone working on WoW.

Beta Testing<br />
Deepholm - Alliance Gunship crash<br />
If you are experiencing client crashes in the area near the Alliance Gunship, temporarily turn your graphic settings to low and set your view distance to the minimum setting. After youâ€™ve completed the quests at the gunship, feel free to restore your settings.<br />
<br />
The fix for this issue has already been implemented in the next build. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968750006/feedback-deepholm/))<br />
<br />
Deepholm - Temple of Earth<br />
The Temple of Earth should be a sanctuary, if that's what you're talking about. Everything else is fair game for PVP. This area should be flagged correctly in the next build. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968750634/wtb-booty-bay-guards-in-deepholm/))<br />
<br />
Player vs. Player<br />
Anti-Crowd Control Talents<br />
We are getting rid of a lot of the &quot;being CC'd doesn't really counter you&quot; talents, because we think they have led to classes not having weaknesses. The fact that instant casts are so important in PvP we think is a direct result from mobility being so important which is a direct result of nobody being controlled. We just need to chill all of that stuff out. If CCs are too potent, we want to nerf the CCs, not give everyone &quot;CCs are impotent&quot; talents. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968750232/a-list-of-warrior-losses-vs-warrior-gains/))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
This is a first pass<br />
While this is a first pass on all of the talent trees, death knight, druid, paladin, warlock, Arcane mage, and Assassination rogue trees are not as far along as other specializations. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=24702229998&amp;sid=2000))<br />
<br />
Damage vs. Utility Talents<br />
Those are actually the decisions we're looking for. Trying to decide between dps and utility isn't a decision (for PvE anyway) and choosing damage vs. damage is a decision most players make by going to third party sites. We want you to be able to get all of the damage talents you reasonably can, and be making decisions over the utility talents. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969520159/new-31pt-trees-my-take-on-the-fury-tree/))<br />
<br />
Damage / PvP Talents loss<br />
Yes. Every class lost &quot;PvP isn't so hard on me&quot; talents and every class lost passive damage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968750232/a-list-of-warrior-losses-vs-warrior-gains/))<br />
<br />
Stats / Damage Loss<br />
In any case, many of the trees lost passive stat bonuses like this. If you want Strength, gear for it. The damage of every class will be adjusted according to the new talent trees. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969520159/new-31pt-trees-my-take-on-the-fury-tree/))<br />
<br />
Passive talents in early tiers<br />
I did say that the first two tiers were liable to contain passive talents. This is for three reasons. First, these are available at very low level where you have few abilities to make a real rotation. Second, they need to be pretty understandable to new players (including experienced players trying a new class for the first time). Third, they need to be attractive to subspecs at high level.<br />
<br />
There are placeholder talents in various places in the trees though, and we'll keep iterating on all of them throughout beta. This is a pretty big change to every class. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969020090/placeholder-talents/))<br />
<br />
Modifying spell coefficients<br />
We're probably not going to have any talents that modify coefficients. Those are really mathy talents and super-confusing for non hardcore players. It also means the talents aren't useful until you have end-game levels of stats on your gear. We'll just increase the damage or healing total, which affects the flat points as well as the coefficients. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969521004/a-little-confused-about-emp-healing-beta/))<br />

Moonkin Form missing from the Talent Tree<br />
We are experimenting between Moonkin Form and Starsurge being the level 10 bonus (the other will be the first active ability in the talent tree). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968840029/balance-druid-talents-where-s-moonkin-form/))<br />

Arcane<br />
Arcane has two passive talents early right now, Torment the Weak and Netherwind Presence. We would like to replace one of them.

Warning: Paladin Skills/Talents in current beta build<br />
These are old talents. This is not the paladin revamp that we said was coming. Sorry, you'll just have to wait a little bit longer. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968569991/paladin-changes-build-12479/))<br />
<br />
Removal of Judgement of Wisdom<br />
This is true. JoW was really only a big deal for hunters, shaman and paladins themselves, and those are all solvable in other ways. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968569991/paladin-changes-build-12479/))<br />
<br />
Divine Illumination<br />
There is no Divine Illumination. Divine Favor is 100% chance to crit on your next heal with a 1 min cooldown. [...] It is still called Divine Favor, still grants a 100% crit chance to the direct heals and Holy Shock (to tie into all the &quot;on crit&quot; mechanics in the tree) and has a 1 min cooldown. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968569991/paladin-changes-build-12479/))<br />
<br />
Paladin Questions (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969020290/a-couple-questions-paladin-trees/))<br />
1. Are Sanctified Ret, Swift Ret, Sanctuary, and Imp Dev Aura going to remain 3-pt talents? They feel too expensive this way. Maybe they can be rolled into individual talents, or changed to cost 2-pts each.<br />
One of Sanctified and Swift is 2 points and the other is 1 point. I can't remember which without looking. Imp Dev Aura is dead. <br />
<br />
2. The whole reactive Judgement thing feels weird to me. If a Ret is taking a lot of damage in PvP, he no longer has to worry about mana? I'm all for new mechanics and making E4E a strong talent, but I'm not sure I like this. On the same note, how about Purifying Power -- if a Holy Paladin dispels his teammate, will it break CC on the enemy who applied the debuff? <br />
Reactive Judgements is also dead.<br />
<br />
I'm going to regret saying this, but the paladin trees are the most changed in the game. There are only a few of the current beta talents that survived the, um, cleansing. <br />
<br />
Holy Shield<br />
We are going to turn both Holy Shield and Shield Block into short cooldowns. A short cooldown is an ability that you don't save for an absolute emergency (like Shield Wall) but we also don't want it to be on such a short cooldown that it feels maintenance-y. It's a tricky number to get right, but something in the 30 sec to 1 min zone feels about right. Then you might use Holy Shield one GCD instead of SoR or you can choose to save it until the next big boss attack. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968669894/holy-shield/))<br />
<br />
Pushback Resistance<br />
Holy paladins get pushback resistance too. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968989947/cataclysm-healer-talent-primary-skills/))<br />
<br />
Paladin Rotations<br />
If we do one thing for class design in Cataclysm, it will be changing the paladin (all 3 specs) rotation up a bit! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626351370/my-cataclysm-protection-warrior-wishlist/))<br />
<br />
Holy Shock<br />
Holy Shock is Holy only again. We wanted an ability that did healing and damage for Holy, and Holy Shock fit that bill.<br />
<br />
We have plenty of other ideas to get more interest into the Prot and Ret rotations. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968990031/holy-shock-holy-only-again/))<br />
<br />
Retribution<br />
In the Ret case, we started with a basic question: what is it they should be managing? There are a lot of things they *could* be managing. Today it's cooldowns. It could be mana or procs or a lot of things. There was one Ret talent in particular we really liked, and we started building a rotation around it. Then we decided the mechanic was good enough to flesh out for Holy and Prot too.<br />
<br />
We're not ready to share the design just yet, and like all changes of this sort, it will be controversial. Some players crave a more interactive rotation. Some like their paladins the way they are. Some are only attracted to the class because it can be overpowered and they like to feel like a superhero. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968670421/a-day-at-the-damage-dealing-office/))<br />

Lightwell<br />
In the current beta build (or possibly the next one), clicking Lightwell no longer switches your target to it. That was one of the changes we've been waiting for to reevaluate the talent. (Enemies can still target it normally.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968750865/blizz-s-plan-to-make-lightwell-useable/))<br />
<br />
Desperate Prayer<br />
Desperate Prayer is a pretty different ability. They really only have the name in common. In Cataclysm, Desperate Prayer has a 45 sec cooldown (down from 2 min). The lower cooldown will let you use it often as leveling.<br />
<br />
Holy also has a talent that when you use Desperate Prayer (to heal yourself), it also heals the most injured ally (a portion of the healing done to you), turning it into an instant, smart Binding Heal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968989947/cataclysm-healer-talent-primary-skills/))<br />
<br />
Shadow Priest - Hit from Spirit<br />
No, we said that hybrids who share gear will be able to convert Spirit to hit. We originally were only going to do it for druids and shaman, but priests argued that it should apply to them too (even though they do have they do have access to actual hit gear).

Damage loss / 2H Weapon Specialization<br />
[...] You didn't lose any damage. Talents that grant nothing but armor pen or Strength are not the kind of talents we want to offer any more, at least below the first couple of tiers. You won't be doing any less damage when you log in for Cataclysm than you do today.<br />
<br />
Imagine the Two-Handed Weapon Specialization from Arms is +28% to damage with two-handed weapons or whatever it needs to be to make up for losing talents. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968750232/a-list-of-warrior-losses-vs-warrior-gains/))<br />
<br />
Stats loss<br />
Most trees are losing free stats such as Strength, hit and expertise. If you want it, you'll have to gear it. The dual-wield trees will keep some free hit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626351370/my-cataclysm-protection-warrior-wishlist/))<br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery<br />
Tactical Mastery is now baked into Stance Mastery (so you retain 25 rage when swapping).(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968750232/a-list-of-warrior-losses-vs-warrior-gains/))<br />
<br />
Piercing Howl<br />
Well, we'd like for Fury to be usable in PvP and there is a certain attraction to Arms having Juggernaut and Bladestorm, but Fury having Piercing Howl. As it is now, it's easy to make a hybrid build that scoops up the best of both talent trees. Rather than having Fury play differently than Arms, you just have Arms with the best of Fury.<br />
<br />
That aside, we're not sure yet how we're going to handle Piercing Howl. One option is to put it in the second tier, the same way we did with Lichborne for DKs. My fear is that opening that door wider leads to a future full of &quot;what is wrong with my class&quot; manifestos from other classes that start off with bullet number one as&quot;Lack of a 6 point talent.&quot; Other options include making it a class-wide ability. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968750232/a-list-of-warrior-losses-vs-warrior-gains/))<br />
<br />
Furious Attacks and Piercing Howl are both PVP exclusive abilities. Furious attacks I'll wait to see if the proc rate got buffed significantly, which may help fury pvp, but as of now it looks unchanged. Piercing Howl is useless to a raider baring a few specific fights. <br />
Furious Attacks I grant you has very limited use in PvE. I disagree about Piercing Howl though. Once upon a time, groups had to control mobs instead of just AE'ing them all down. Someone who wants a build solely focused on killing single-target raid bosses (which to be fair, we don't have many of these days) might skip over Piercing Howl, but we are trying to structure the trees such that you don't have an option to get dps elsewhere even if you do. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969520159/new-31pt-trees-my-take-on-the-fury-tree/))<br />
<br />
Shield Block<br />
We are going to turn both Holy Shield and Shield Block into short cooldowns. A short cooldown is an ability that you don't save for an absolute emergency (like Shield Wall) but we also don't want it to be on such a short cooldown that it feels maintenance-y. It's a tricky number to get right, but something in the 30 sec to 1 min zone feels about right. Then you might use Holy Shield one GCD instead of SoR or you can choose to save it until the next big boss attack. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968669894/holy-shield/))<br />
<br />
AE Rotation<br />
I agree. We tried making warrior AE &quot;rotations&quot; just one button, but we didn't like it. We'll change the other classes instead. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626351370/my-cataclysm-protection-warrior-wishlist/))<br />
<br />
Heroic Leap - NYI<br />
Heroic Leap isn't implemented yet. The level cap isn't at 85. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626351370/my-cataclysm-protection-warrior-wishlist/))<br />
<br />
Heroic Strike<br />
Heroic Strike is off of the GCD but with a short cooldown so it isn't in danger of competing with Execute (which hits considerably harder now). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25968750144/execute-sudden-death/))<br />

Impending Victory<br />
As promised, we have cut Impending Victory and given Fury a new attack that they can used only when Enraged (but does not consume the Enrage). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969520159/new-31pt-trees-my-take-on-the-fury-tree/))<br />
<br />
Enrage<br />
Enrage procs on all damage (including raid AE damage). We also want Fury to be a viable PvP spec in any case. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969520159/new-31pt-trees-my-take-on-the-fury-tree/))<br />

Unbridled Wrath/Rage in LK<br />
You're operating under the &quot;rage doesn't matter&quot; mindset of Lich King. In Cataclysm, the ability to get rage from talents is going to be pretty attractive.<br />
<br />
The issue isn't that it gives rage, but that it gives so little of it. <br />
That's a tuning issue, not a fundamental flaw with the design of the talent. If you find yourself low on rage, you can get this talent in the same way a mage might get a talent to make nukes cheaper. If you find you don't need the rage -- perhaps you have Booming Voice or get it from Charge or something -- then you can take another talent instead.

Those are actually the decisions we're looking for. Trying to decide between dps and utility isn't a decision (for PvE anyway) and choosing damage vs. damage is a decision most players make by going to third party sites. We want you to be able to get all of the damage talents you reasonably can, and be making decisions over the utility talents. (Source)<br />

That means the CD you have on Live will be the same as in Cata if you spec unholy (at present, subject to change, etc).<br />

<br />
The primary purpose for me will be positioning my imp so blood pact is reaching the people it needs to. If the tank is doing something over there and I need to be over here, you to need to move over there, click stay, then move back...which is fine in fight setup, but not if you and the tank are seperating midfight.<br />
<br />
If I pop an invis potion in pvp, my demon still marks my location, so I have to tell it to stay so it doesn't give away my exact position (or dismiss it). With this you could pop invis, move in one direction and move the demon in the other...still in range of abilities like your VW shield or silence, but far enough away that it doesn't give away your exact location.<br />
<br />
There are other niggly little moments in pvp, soloing elites and trying to get your pet to move the mob away (if you don't have the space to move away yourself), just general convenience I think. I'm sure there are better examples of this but these come to mind!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just really really hope they reconsider the stay in one tree thing for levelling. Levelling is my favourite part of the game, and i love to mix up trees to get the best levelling spec i can at any one point in time, so i can attempt larger pulls and challenge myself. <br />
<br />
Could they not just give an advice box saying 'newer players should probably stick to one tree, as this will help to make your character more effective' or something, and let players who enjoy the fun of trying new ideas actually play around with their specs as they level?<br />
<br />
Fine pick a tree and stick with it, but just have it (while levelling) so that you need more points in the tree you picked than the rest. For example if you picked fury, you could be at 4/7/2 at one point in time, rather than having to be at 0/13/0 because blizz are worried new players will make mistakes. <br />
<br />
Its the one thing i strongly dont like about all the changes, and i really hope they reconsider it. Let players make mistakes. Its how we learn.<br />
<br />
I was terrible when i first started playing, but the whole fun of the game and the reason i stayed was because i was learning and improving which was exciting.<br />
<br />
You have to let people make mistakes, you cant hold their hand the whole-way through. let us choose blizz, let us choose!</div></div><hr />

This. There can never be a choice between DPS and utility talents because DPS always wins, or between two different DPS talents, because one is always better. So now there are points where you have to choose between non-dps talent A and non-dps talent B, because that's the only way for there to be an actual decision to make.<br />
<br />
Of course, many people seem to have the attitude that any talent point that doesn't directly increase their DPS is &quot;wasted&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It's perfect to position mobs when soloing. So often your pet tanks in the path of another mob and you need to put it on passive and follow to get it to move to you (just follow will make him stop coming every time he gets hit). In a raid, position your pet close to a healer to be able to intercept adds quicker. Many situations where I wished I had this option, so I'm very looking forward to this.</div></div><hr />

Okay, I'll give an example. I'm using the arcane mage tree; I realise they've said it's not as far along as some of the others, but it works fine in this context.<br />
<br />
I put 19 points in, taking all the mandatory (ie DPS-increasing) talents, and end up at this spec: http://www.wowtal.com/#k=1u56PA.9mn.mage<br />
<br />
Now, I have to put points into a non-DPS talent to progress further down the tree. So I can choose between Improved Blink, Improved Polymorph, Improved Counterspell, Prismatic Cloak and Arcane Repulsion, all utility or survivability talents. This is an actual choice that I can make. If there was another DPS talent available, there would be no choice, because I would have to take it or I wouldn't be competitive.<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler explicitly states in a post quoted on the front page that this is the design intent behind the new trees. Here it is again: <br />
<br />
<br />
Damage vs. Utility Talents<br />
Those are actually the decisions we're looking for. Trying to decide between dps and utility isn't a decision (for PvE anyway) and choosing damage vs. damage is a decision most players make by going to third party sites. We want you to be able to get all of the damage talents you reasonably can, and be making decisions over the utility talents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Secondly ... I just dont understand how Blizzard is keeping all the abilites and % of classes when they reduce points. Masteries do not count for half of those. It really looks like there are gonna be alot of hidden stats to balance out the current abilites.<br />
<br />
And ofc... is STILL becomes really obvious what classes are loved and what classes are left last. Druids and paladins are yet again the classes that are miles behind. Those two classes need ALOT of tweaking and balancing and still Blizzard always picks them last - and usually taking the first 6 months AFTER launch to fix the blatantly obvious issues... And then... they start talking about fixing the rest in next expansion... And again... those classes are left for last.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This so called &quot;design&quot; is terrible. Instead of forcing us to pick up some crappy utility talent why not make utility talents good? Making talents that are a tough choice between utility and dps is a goal. Why not achieve that by making the utility talents good for once?<br />
<br />
The last utility talent that warlocks(for example) picked up was Imp soul leech for the mana returns which turns out to be a dps increase because the player spends less time life tapping. <br />
<br />
The only thing I would consider in that mage tree is the imp poly due to the stun effect for CC on trash. All the others are fairly craptactular. Look at the destruction warlock tree for an example. To move pass the second tier the player has to spend a point in imp searing pain(lol) or imp shadowbolt. Both of which are never used in a pve setting for destruction. To move out of tier three the player has to spend another point in those talents or aftermath. After that It is clear sailing through the tree. I would also pick up soul leech for the mana returns(Since it is utility and a dps increase after all).</div></div><hr />

I'm using the arcane mage tree; I realise they've said it's not as far along as some of the others, but it works fine in this context.<br />
<br />
I put 19 points in, taking all the mandatory (ie DPS-increasing) talents, and end up at this spec: http://www.wowtal.com/#k=1u56PA.9mn.mage<br />
<br />
Now, I have to put points into a non-DPS talent to progress further down the tree. So I can choose between Improved Blink, Improved Polymorph, Improved Counterspell, Prismatic Cloak and Arcane Repulsion, all utility or survivability talents. This is an actual choice that I can make. If there was another DPS talent available, there would be no choice, because I would have to take it or I wouldn't be competitive.<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler explicitly states in a post quoted on the front page that this is the design intent behind the new trees. Here it is again:<br />
<br />
You are right, BUT not everyone is as lucky as arcane mages. Few examples: <br />
<br />
This is how a typical holy priest build will look like<br />
http://www.wowtal.com/#k=b1w4Z7jT.9mn.priest Only time we had to make a choice in utility, is Choir Leader, and most ppl will take Inspiration instead (I skip it just cause I never liked that talent... feels too close to what disc are doing...) AND we are actually lacking at least 3 more talent points that could improve our healing/longevity. Oh and also we AGAIN don't have free points to put in to body and soul...<br />
<br />
Another example are resto druids. I'm not very good here, but I assume most ppl will spec like this http://www.wowtal.com/#k=D31ndRT.9mn.druid<br />
The problem here is that first 2 tiers dudus are forced to pick up talents that are both not affecting healing, are boring AND pretty much useless. And the only real choice for utility is that last 1 talent point, that you can either put in to chance for instant wrath cast when healing, 2 more % of damage reduction or PvP on crit stacking dmg reduction. (or some feral talents... he, why not?)<br />
<br />
<br />
I do love the overall idea, but atm, many specs are fucked up.<br />
<br />
EDIT: ofc, there are good examples as well: as ele shammy, I'm happy that we both get conviction, improved firenova totem AND an instant cast for ghost wolf in PvE spec ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />

The point is, there's no way to make a utility talent good enough that a player who wants to maximise their DPS will choose it over a DPS-increasing talent. I'm not a warlock expert, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I assume you don't currently have to give up any talents that directly increase DPS to take Imp. Soul Leech. If it turned out that a &quot;utility&quot; talent did actually produce better DPS than a DPS talent, it would be hard to argue that that's still a utility talent.<br />

To quote a blue &quot;[The talent trees] have 38-42 or so points in them. You could spend all 41 points in one tree, though often you'll want a 5/5/31 or a 0/7/34 build instead.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Our current specs for destruction do skip some straight dps talents for the dps gain provided by imp soul leech. Currently Imp soul leech out dps's destruction builds that dip into aff for the hit rating and destruction builds that buff the imps damage. So yes we do give up hit rating or damage and five talent points for that utility. It is provides the same replenishment effect that other classes currently have. Hence why it is considered a utility.</div></div><hr />

This way a Fire Mage can pick up some really nice talents such as Arcane Concentration, Torment the Weak, Netherwind Presence and Arcane Poteny.<br />
<br />
The higher tiers need some work, because as a PVE Arcane Mage you need to spend atleast 4 points on more PVP oriented talents in order to move to higher tiers and reach 31 points.<br />
<br />
That's the design. When they said they wanted us to have choices in how we spend out talent points that's what they meant. Look, when you're talking about talents that increase DPS there's always going to be one that is mathematically better than the other. So any time they offer a &quot;choice&quot; between two talents which increase DPS, people are always going to go online, find the latest simulated answer and pick that talent (or they'll be &quot;bad&quot;). With utility talents it tends to not be like that. This is why PvP builds and tanks builds tend to have a lot more &quot;optional&quot; points than PVE DPS builds. With utility talents you pick them based on your play style and what talents you hope will help your survivability/mobility most. <br />
<br />
Realizing this Blizzard has built talents trees without enough DPS increasers to actually fill a tree. You'll have to pick at least some utility talents, which is where your &quot;options&quot; come from. When you put together a DPS class' talent build you'll have between 4-6 points that will be spent on utility talents; simply because there won't be any DPS talents left. So, for instance, as a combat rogue I can decide whether I'll get more benefit from a 25% armor increase, a shorter CD on Sprint, or maybe a more effective interrupt. Since they're all utility talents, an argument can probably be made for any of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
This so called &quot;design&quot; is terrible. Instead of forcing us to pick up some crappy utility talent why not make utility talents good? Making talents that are a tough choice between utility and dps is a goal. Why not achieve that by making the utility talents good for once?<br />
<br />
<br />
For PvP player, perhaps, but a PVE player will always, always take the DPS increaser over the utility talent. Always. If there are two DPS increasers, they'll go online and find out which one is mathematically &quot;best&quot; and pick that one. That's why 9/10 PvE DPS specs have a mathematically optimized &quot;cookie cutter&quot; build with at best an optional point or two.</div></div><hr />

Well okay, in that case I think we are basically just quibbling over definitions at this point. But I don't think you can call it a utility talent if it increases your DPS so much that you would choose it over a straight DPS talent, even if it also provides utility. Or at least, you can't say it's not a DPS talent. And since it's a DPS talent, the problems I've mentioned apply: you'll always choose it over a talent that's purely utility, and if you have a choice between it and another DPS talent, one of them will give provably better DPS. Either way, there's no choice involved.</div></div><hr />

&quot;...Piercing Howl is useless to a raider baring a few specific fights.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blue-<br />
I disagree about Piercing Howl though. Once upon a time, groups had to control mobs instead of just AE'ing them all down.<br />
<br />
<br />
The blue poster is abosolutly right. Piercing Howl is extremely useful in raids.<br />
<br />
Warriors do not have a rage dump, so if a warrior pulls agro while cleaving trash, boarding up and the AOE slow provided by Piercing Howl is all that is going to save his bacon.<br />
<br />
And secondly, it is an excellent tool to help assist the tank grab agro on trash.<br />
<br />
you charge a group of adds, thunderclap, Piercing Howl and then kite them to the tank, then while you are PH you do donuts around the tank till the tank picks them up.<br />
<br />
Piercing howl is invaluable and i would hate to see it removed from an Arms or Fury warrior.</div></div><hr />

There is no way that will be the Holy Build. You're applying today's mindset to tomorrow's game. Holy Nova has gotten a significant buff in that tree, if you didn't notice. 15% mana reduction on Heal, Gheal and Hymn vs 50% Crit on Nova with a chance to proc a free one? If it doesn't get nerfed, that's standard in any build. A Priest without Inspiration is the one-legged man in an ass kicking contest. Inspiration scales with increased boss damage. That alone makes it worthwhile compared to some of the other choices. 1/3 Empowered Renew for the Proc. Especially since Renew will roll with Heal in Chakra, so there's a chance you may get nothing out of Empowered Renew after the initial cast. Unless the mana nerf is severe, which I doubt will be the case for anyone who played this game when OOM'ing was a reality, the conservation talents will be fairly worthless. The standard build will be probably be wowtal.com/#k=B1wTEQaZ.9mn.priest or something very similar.</div></div><hr />

I've always laughed at healers, who underestimate the importance of longevity talents even now. Ignoring them in cata will, most likely, bring the same reaction as warriors with deep wounds received back when bosses had 8 debuff slots.<br />
Oh and I judging from your build, you want to play holy as a disc that heals while raid... Well, it does not work like that. We are in raids to SAVE ppl from dieing, preventing dmg is for other spec. Yeah, you can say why not do both if we can? sure, but don't sacrifice our initial strengths for that sake.</div></div><hr />

I have been asking for this for a long time, not having to have a separate spec for PvP and PvE, if they want to balance them together they should make all the PvP oriented abilities baseline and take PvP out of the talent trees and just focus on damage. It baffles my mind why they wouldn't do it that way becasue they could adjust the abilities themselves instead of messing with the talents all the time.

I really can see WOW go badly downhill after Cata. These talent tree changes take alot out of the game. Freedom of your own builds have been removed and you are litterally forced to pick one of two possible talents almost the entire leveling up process. At the same time many are looking at the other 2 trees and seeing some really intresting abilities that all would take and would increase the enjoyment of leveling up.<br />
<br />
And no... Blizzard will not be able to create 30 talent trees that are intresting to level up in. I Even doubt they will be able to create more than 10-12.</div></div><hr />

ofc you are atm. for example lock in pvp with felguard would die for &quot;go to&quot; button, becouse with fel on follow and melee attacking him he cant use his charge</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its a 31 point talent you can't skip it. Under the specialization model Blizzard forces you to take the 31 point talent before you can get to any of the other trees.</div></div><hr />

I was looking forward to that. These talent trees are really lacking. Most of the trees are too bloated to get what you want out of another tree. Also having to pick up pvp talents for a pve build only to have to spend another 5 points over that 31 point talent really is annoying.<br />
<br />
The first two masteries were changed into the passive bonuses given as part as one's specialization at level 10. They no longer scale with talent points.<br />
<br />
The third 'special' mastery is now given much later (Trained at level 75ish I think they said). It scales with the Mastery stat, but not talent points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it appears to only require you to spend 31 points in the tree; not necessarily take the 31 point talent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really because if you read the last part, the important part, you would understand that what you should be smelling is a huge incoming nerf to stun lock, fear and all other forms of CC. There will be no need for cc counter talents if the ccs aren't overly powerful to begin with.<br />

<br />
The higher tiers need some work, because as a PVE Arcane Mage you need to spend atleast 4 points on more PVP oriented talents in order to move to higher tiers and reach 31 points.<br />
<br />
That is the goal they currently have for all of the trees.<br />

And ofc... is STILL becomes really obvious what classes are loved and what classes are left last. Druids and paladins are yet again the classes that are miles behind. <br />
<br />
Blizzard simply hates paladins. They hate them so much that they have left them completely overpowered for 5 years. I wish I got hate like from my boss, I'd be rich!</div></div><hr />

Like I said, any Priest who played Vanilla will have no problems going back to the things we did back then to conserve mana. Namely, cast-canceling. A single cast-cancel will save more mana than any conservation talent you took in that build. It's like stacking your gear with Luminous gems, instead of Reckless when you don't OOM. It just makes no sense. I'm not sure what you mean about Disc healing. The build grabs Inner fire and uses minimum points to get there. The skipped talents, namely Improved Healing and Choir leader are a joke. BaS, while fun, isn't worth losing anything else in the build. Meditation is the only mandatory regeneration talent, and it's baseline now. Problem solved. You can run any build you want. If you just cant resist finishing casts and have no clue what overheal is, by all means, take 10 regen talents and finish encounters with a full mana bar. Meanwhile, everyone else will be carrying you with my build. If the trees stay the same, I guarantee you will see this as the standard build come Cataclysm. Improved Healing is already skipped by 99% of the community, yet they still go 12/12 in ICC and down RS within hours of opening. Actually surprised the talent made it past Alpha. Mental Agility is a great talent for Shield or Renew spamming. If you are Disc, by all means. If you are spamming Renew, let me introduce your guild to this thing called Druids. They are a really cool class who will make your raids better... and your Renew worthless.</div></div><hr />

That should be fun (and useful). I am glad to see that they announced the lock trees aren't finish. I was pretty annoyed with the destro tree since I had to dump points in 2 of 3 talents that did nothing for me to progress further. I don't need searing pain as a pve-er, I definitely don't need Imp Shadowbolt for destro, and I can't think of a single destro lock that uses soulfire in pve (I also can't think of many that use it often enough in pvp to make it a worthwhile cast). Now reading the tooltip it seems once an enemy is below 80% the points I spent there are wasted anyways. If they are trying to make it so we can add another spell to our rotation I find this to be a flaw that they chose soulfire as the spell, especially since we are already getting new spells that will accomplish this. You would either have to burn a soulshard to get it to be an instant cast which would in turn generate a shit ton of threat (and we all know locks have more than enough threat gen as is), or we would have to sacrifice starting dps for the long castime of soulfire (and I doubt the haste would make up for that... plus I have the feeling we would have to cast it a few times before a boss falls below 80%). I don't know, I may not be thinking about those correctly but I hope those talents are up for changing when they DO revamp the lock trees.</div></div><hr />

They are a really cool class who will make your raids better... and your Renew worthless.<br />
<br />
Well for starters, there is a line, between good healer and great (geek) healer. It's rather faint and almost impossible to tell where one ends and other starts, but I don't want to cross it by any means. I don't want healing becoming for me like DPS, where e-peen reigns supreme. Heal cancelling is around that lines. I prefer to stick to the common sense of &quot;I heal if I need to and I don't cast anything if I don't&quot;. <br />
<br />
Also, reading your posts, I can't help to wonder if you ever were a priest at all... Why? Firstly, someone who does not want BoS is either not a priest or a very, very sad person... No offence here. As a little test, tell me, what things are you waiting the most in upcoming expansion, when it comes to priests?<br />
<br />
Regarding disc, I meant that you went for inspiration and imp PWS instead of mental agility. No, really, most of the time we will be casting CoH and POM, with some renews and flash heals (I guess now it will be simply heals) in between. Also, a simple rule I learned when I just started raiding as holy: DON'T touch PWS at all, unless it's a difference between life and death. Holy has all the tools to save ppl without using shields. Not, I'm not saying don't use it at all, but leave mass shields to disc priests.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I don't know why you give a druid example... I don\t know how YOU use renew, but usually it is used as a moderate HoT on targets that will not be taking any more dmg for some time or will be taking constant dmg. For example ppl who had DnD casted on them by Deathwisper will just move out of it in a second, so no need to waste time casting anything big on them. Or Festergut's raid dmg.</div></div><hr />

Or I'm just being paranoid :)<br />
<br />
About revamped talent trees, well at first I was surprised and disappointed, but when you consider current talent trees, you clearly see that the number of points you can spend and talents you can choose do not equate to more possibilities, more liberty and more customization. Once you hit 80 you know that except for 1 to 3 talents, the rest are mandatory in order to be optimal in PvP or PvE. As a rogue, I used to always read, check and compare my talents, but now I just pick the cookie cutter build and don't look at my talents anymore, both because I know them by heart, and because I know this is the optimal spec and that there is little to no point in trying to modify it.<br />
<br />
Only thing with 31 talent trees is that it restricts our possibilities in that we cannot access nice talents located in secondary trees (for a mut rogue it would hurt me to have vanish / blind / clos back to their normal CD, cost, range etc. :'( ).</div></div><hr />

If by BoS you mean Body and Soul I think I should let you in on something... it's a gimmick talent and should only be taken if you have literally no other worthwhile place to put those points (e.g. no talent spent anywhere will make your heals more effective) . The only use I'm aware this talent has ever had is on Anub HM. It's also not a good idea to annoy your discipline priest by putting shields on people. If there isn't a discipline priest around then do what you like but if I was in a raid and saw that specced in your talent tree I'd be very, very worried.<br />
<br />
The new version of the talent, that causes you to dispel poisons, may be mandatory based purely on that.</div></div><hr />

And in case you still don't get it, the problem I've stated before is that BoS is a freaken awesome talent, but we can not afford to spec in to it with current talent trees.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">matheryn</div><div class="date">2010-07-19, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well one this is for sure there still needs to be ALOT of changes to the talants as reducing the size of the trees is going to make everyone choose the same talants in the end making everyone go from being unique to just a number as this game was ment to make people feel unique with different looks ect now making everyone choose the same talants in smaller trees is going to make joe blo look the same as tom jones <br />
I play a destro lock and the new changes have litterally destroyed my spec that i have now which is mainly focus'd on burst fire damage. the rotation is going to be destroyed not to mention the talants are going to halve my damage and force me to waste talant points in areas that i dont feel are appropriate to my play style and yes i know this is beta and its still subject to change so i hope to crist it will change for the better because there is a huge uproar atm with the current selection from the masses and in the end if this is what there going to bring out this game will follow the same path as ultima online aka bad expansion = loss of playerbase<br />
i know alot of people will nodoubt flame this post saying if i dont like it then leave or that im a winging kid or a nub or noob or something else more vulgar but to be honest flaming me will do nothing as this post will still be read by others <br />
all im trying to say is if you anger the masses then its like a domino's effect and it has already been proven from mmos in the past once 1 leave 2 leave then 3 the 300 then 500 then 600 ect because if another game looks more apealing to what people want there is usually a massive shift in playerbase to that new game especially if its predecessor produces an expansion that a high volume of the general consumers dont like.<br />
but thats my 2 cents - definately not going to be everyones cup of tea but that doesnt mean you have to accept it</div></div><hr />
