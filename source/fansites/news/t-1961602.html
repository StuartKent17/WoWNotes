The map is real. Or at least the location lorewise of the broken isles is real. Maybe it looks &quot;off centre&quot; due to updated technology of the Horde and Alliance? Perhaps it's always been that way.</div></div><hr />

It is a tiny bit off centre, but not by much.. Enough to notice though :p<br />

Those are some pretty big zones, and it's more than on par with 5-6 EK zones. If anything it seems downscaled, it's roughly the size of Howling Fjord + Grizzly hills on that map.</div></div><hr />

Well, if you did the quests, you likely will. Simply cause it saves the quest rewards. I have the same problem. Why should a shadow that's usually wearing robes, keep things like bracers, legs, shirts or shoes for transmogg? Can't see them anyway.</div></div><hr />

Most of them are send Champion to point X for 30 - 360 minutes and they get XP.<br />
<br />
One is 5 seconds. That one looks like the 'new' missions that let us go there after they 'discover' stuff.<br />
<br />
But it looks like the Garrison table will be alive and well in Legion. <br />
<br />
I honestly do not expect any real content patches for this expansion. It is March and all Blizzard has stated is that they 'WANT' to add more patches like they did in Wrath. Not a bit of solid information on if they are ACTUALLY going to do it.<br />
<br />
I am suspecting the temptation to treat this as another Steam Early Access scam is too great for Blizzard. Sell expansion keys along with the required 1-12 months of subscriptions and then lock the doors and get out of town before players know the jig is up.<br />

From looking at the UI Lua code it looks like the block of code with captcha stuff in it only activates if you are not logging in automatically.<br />

The Broken Isles seem to have a lot of verticality. Northrend also has a lot of open areas, like most of the Borean Tundra, Dragonblight, and Zul'drak, for example.<br />
<br />
Not that the world map is exactly to scale, or that this is final.<br />
<br />
There's a new world map in Chronicle that looks similar to this, but makes more sense visually, and also has the Lost Isles, Kezan, and the Wandering Isle. That's probably what the final will look like.<br />
<br />

<br />
Also note: Chronicle states that pre-Sundering Kalimdor was just the largest continent on Azeroth. There are more continents beyond the edges of our maps.</div></div><hr />

That map looks awkward to me,the Eastern Kingdoms seems to have shifted more to the east to compensate, doesn't feel real to me...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hopefully they'll add a lot more rewards to the game - Including some custom Transmog sets. It'd be a real opportunity to add some really bizzarre outfits/costumes that don't neccessarily fit in with any classes or looks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The map size/scale has nothing to do with their in-game size or the actual scale within the lore.</div></div><hr />

After seeing these changes from this build it's pretty clear that these fucking things are here to stay with WoW. It's been fun playing this game for the last 11 years, so many good memory's etc, but this fucking new team are damn awful that it's not worth playing a facebook game anymore.<br />
<br />
I don't know how people cannot see this as gated content, what's more disappointing is that it will tie into the Artifact as well. Screw this game and screw Blizzard for screwing it up.:mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Miss them? Rhe Broken Isles aren't a hidden continent or anything like Pandaria was. Everyone knew they were there they just didn't have a reason to land there until now, and just sailed passed them on their way between EK and Kalimdor/Northrend.</div></div><hr />

Strangely, he sometimes goes around killing other demons. Stranger still, while doing so, he refers to himself as Loramus Thalipedes, the famous demon hunter who killed him long ago in the Blasted Lands!<br />
<br />
Awwww yeah! One of my favourite questlines in Blasted Lands. Seems like the Demon Hunter is inside the Demon instead of the other way around. If so that opens up some awesome new Lore with Demon hunters being able to bind their souls to the Bodies of Demons and control them.<br />

Blizzard and their damn scaling... They want to make the Broken Isles look so big while it's not (and it's not a problem neither, you can't expect a continent of 5-6 zones to be as big as half Kalimdor/EK anyway...) <br />
<br />
They'd better take their own new book as an example goddamn it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Scale in game =/= scale in Lore. <br />
<br />
Hence why Goldshire is like 3 buildings but in lore it is quite a sizable village.<br />
<br />
I tend to imagine every few meters I run in game across a zone is actually 100m or so in lore World scale.<br />

What is disappointing is people going fucking bonkers over something that they obviously don't understand.<br />
<br />
At least read into shit before going spastic over it. Class Halls were always going to be the next progression of Garrisons, though this time the missions actually open up content for the Player.</div></div><hr />

So, is Alpha the new Beta or what? At first I thought it was just a mistake, but it has been going on for months now and hasn't been corrected. What's up with that?</div></div><hr />

I completely understand how Class Order Halls work, I'm no child and have been on this Earth for 34 years. They are still Garrison table missions with a new coat of paint on it, and no matter how much you polish a turd it's still a turd. <br />
<br />
The follower system is 100% the same from WoD, and i think you need to go read up on it since your very clueless about it. Or even better i will explain it for all people to understand once and for all.<br />
<br />
You have X mission that needs X amount of resource and X amount of followers with X followers needing X counter for said mission with X amount of time to complete or you might fail it and miss out on mission / reward(yay more fucking rng bullshit), how is this different ? it's not. You also need to gear up you followers, so how is this different from WoD ? It's not again. <br />
<br />
Get the reason why I'm pissed off for, at the core it's still the same with the only difference is to get the reward you need to go complete the mission your self when the scout gets back. What a waste of time, just put daily quests in for each area and get rid of this poor mans follower system. Or even better have the map in the class order halls mark the locations of where the objectives / quests etc are and cut out this middle man that is only gating the content.<br />
<br />
Look if Legion goes live with this shitty system in place i will quit WoW for good, I will not be playing another fucking expansion with a Facebook game attached to it. I want my Vanilla / BC / Wrath WoW back thanks.</div></div><hr />
