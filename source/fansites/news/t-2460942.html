If I had an overarching issue with PvP in general, it's the amount of healing done by non-healer specs and even non-hybrid classes, whether passive or active abilities and/or Azerite traits. No sympathy for MWer though, at least you can keep your 55 second CD Cocoon... and I don't know a MW PvPer who didn't think they were broken atm.</div></div><hr />

You had your BM overpower at the start of the expansion for 2-3 weeks. You made 2400 very fast. Now wait and let other classes to be op.</div></div><hr />

In 2's and 3's it's pretty strong, as you can either use it offensively or defensively... either way, it exerts quite a bit of pressure while still being able to fulfill your main healing role. It ties into my issue when it comes to healing from non-healers becoming ridiculous in PvP, as there are a sizable number of classes/specs where this healing is completely passive or has almost no cost at all. They've done a decent job in raids when it comes to tanks and making them reliant on healers, but PvP has gone the complete opposite way where some DPS barely need healers or require very little healer attention.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ahhh, yeah.<br />
<br />
I mostly play rbgs so I was surprised by the crane nerf - it felt fine before. I mostly only used it for the snare/root removal anyway.<br />
<br />
Surging mist nerf was needed i'll admit, increasing mana cost and reducing healing output in one swoop might have been a bit overboard though. we'll see. I guess I'll get to be a oomweaver again :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2019-01-11, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would really love some insight into what guides arena balancing. I mean we have Disc Priest, Assassination Rogue and Shadow Priest as the most highly represented specs in high level 3s yet none of them seem to get touched, yet specs that are far less represented are getting nerfed. Priests account for 15% of the top rated characters in 3s and 13% in 2s while making up about 8% of the level 120 player population. There are more level 120 DKs than there are Rogues yet Rogues are 8 times more highly represented at the top end of arena. It gets even weirder if you start looking at racials, Orcs being about 7% of the population of level 120 players make up over 30% of the high rated arena toons.<br />
<br />
Looking at these changes Mistweaver is the strongest spec in 2s. Elemental doesn't seem to be doing particularly well in any bracket. Balance seems to be strong in RBGs but in arenas almost non existant. While you could maybe justify the Mistweaver spec based on their 2s strength the others just seem strange. They are at best mid-range specs with a representation that doesn't really stand out so why are they getting nerfed when the obvious culprits that are doing well in every bracket, Assassination, Disc and Shadow Priest go untouched? It is just hard to see what the reasoning could be and I wish Blizzard would share some of the data on which they make these decisions because they often seem to be hitting the wrong targets.<br />
<br />
My best guess is that they are only balancing around the opinions of a small number of high end players but that doesn't seem to be making for a game that is balanced for the general population of players and it seems quite likely that whatever system they are using a few favoured specs seem to be creeping through without any real adjustment despite the fact that the data seems to show they badly need it. Even if you want to argue that the representation is due to players who want to do arena being far more likely to roll Rogue or Priest isn't that fact itself indicitave of a problem?</div></div><hr />
