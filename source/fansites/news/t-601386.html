<br />
We just had a talk with the guys from our server, For the Horde.<br />
<br />
The community appreciates it making a movie about a lore heavy encounter everyone likes to see.<br />
<br />
But there are still raidgrps who want to see stuff like this unspoilered. Even though you can't get a real glimpse of anything like tactics or whatever, it takes away a lot of expectatations. There will always be someone in the raid who has seen it. It's human curiosity.<br />
<br />
Well anyway, it will be the most seen video, ever.</div></div><hr />

Those who don't want to be spoiled should just not watch the movie. Is it really that difficult?</div></div><hr />

They should have just waited for prolly 3-4 more kills.<br />
<br />
It's world first and he hasn't been slain again from anyone else, not even from them I reckon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
the Guilds like curse who are currently doing the encounter have probably figured out the tactics by now anyway and chances are big they wont even watch the movie.<br />
<br />
on the other hand there has been a great majority of the wow community waiting for this movie. It would be stupid to wait a couple of months with the movie. I think they released it late as it is allready</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they want to see stuff like that unspoiled...then guess what...DON'T watch the video. And if someone in the raid group has, then tell them to shut up about it. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
I didn't see anyone complaining about Mother Shahraz's kill videos being released, and only 2 guilds have killed her. So your logic isn't consistent.<br />
<br />
The community wanted to see what this fight is like. Nihilum released a video, without ventrillo (which WOULD have revealed spoiling tactics), to show people what the fight is like.<br />
<br />
On a final note, many guilds extensively research an upcoming boss encounter that they have never experienced before, including every member watching kill videos and reading strategies beforehand. And guess what? They go in there and they wipe like crazy. Not because they didn't know what was coming, but because fighting a boss first-hand is so much more than a video could ever capture, strategy and experience-wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I remember them saying they don't rely on vent.<br />
Nevertheless, just trying to illustrate my point :P</div></div><hr />

Although any guild not making use of it to guide their own strategies will be shooting themselves in the foot to pass up this inside information.</div></div><hr />
