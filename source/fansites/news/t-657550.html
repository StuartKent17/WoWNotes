I hate achievements. I believe that &quot;link achiev or no inv&quot; spam is just rubbish, ask the person if he has done said instance, and if not, inv him and explain the fight!<br />
<br />
I miss the golden days where you had 1 day of doing a boss, and that was challenging enough, there were no ****heads with BiS gear galavanting their Hard*** achiements in front of everybody's nose. What are you proud of? Of spending night after night wiping on bosses, to show people who go out, have fun with their friends, have a real life, your hard mode achievements?<br />
<br />
Can we not have Black Temple-like bosses? You say Hard Mode brings challenges to players? Ha well go to Teron or BB and see if that's not hard enough for people who don't have 1/10 of their brain working.<br />
<br />
It's becoming racism, where people discriminate you in a guild application/raid invite if you haven't spend days wiping to get some hard modes.<br />
<br />
And about other achievements, well, getting a tabard, completing daily quests, well i guess that justifies itself.<br />
<br />
I know that there are out there achievements that might be hard (never tried them, i do occasional achiements, don't care about the ones you need to work for), but if you needed something else to keep you playing this game, i'm sorry that they included achievements to fulfill that goal. <br />
<br />
TL:DR. I wouldn't call it dedication. Achievements are just a way to have epeen bigger than anyone else's. And tell me, did that ever do anyone any good?<br />

The guy has plenty of realm firsts. He is the leader of a top raiding guild. This isn't of the scale of &quot;fall 65 yards&quot;. This is far, far more, since he has covered pretty much every aspect of the game - raiding, arenas and battlegrounds.</div></div><hr />

I agree i don't like achievs either but i don't mind others doing it, but the game is coming closer and closer to forcing us to do achievs if it goes on like this...i don't even got the choice to do achievs or i will never get into a guild on my rerolled realm. And im not talking about some heroics done achiev, im talking aout guilds who will demand having 5k achiev points to be able to join while they dont even bother chekcing where those 5k points come from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course he didn't. Nobody, who tries to cheapen this guy's achievement trough ad hominem have achieved something on their own. Their self esteem is so low that the only way they can feel better about themselves is to insult someone and drag the person below them, giving them the artificial sense of pride, because &quot;hey, at least I am not as bad as this guy!&quot;. While actually, they are far, far more sad and pathetic. That's the typical bully motivation doing what they do.<br />
<br />
Raising your own self esteem at the expense of insulting others is extremely pathetic. The saddest thing about it, though, is that many people see doing this as nothing bad. Maybe they just don't understand the reasoning behind it. I don't know. But it just saddens me. This is why humanity is so damn miserable all the time - we don't even understand ourselves properly and hurt ourselves and others out of sheer ignorance.</div></div><hr />

There was - for the first to hit 80 of each race/class and race/class combo on the server.<br />

This guy is not just a random player who spends countless of hours on the game. He has covered every aspect of the game, and must be an extremely good player, better than most of the people posting &quot;lol what a freak&quot; in this thread. He must have gotten a lot of achievents which require tactics, skills, careful planning and more - I would assume that he is likely a pretty intelligent person (again, perhaps more intelligent than most people writing here). <br />
<br />
Also, remember that doing something in the game only takes as much time as you use doing it. I would imagine that this guy (through planning and dedication) might farm reputation much faster than most people would. And he has probably won Arena-matches over and over again, while you can hardly cap the Farm in AB. And it is completely possible that your guild uses 3 hours to clear a few bosses in Ulduar, but this guy's guild is probably clearing it without wipes (which means that he can spend the remaining times getting drunk while you're still trying to avoid the fires on Razorscale).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, what now? Play more?<br />
<br />
<br />
Hm, now he can go partying. Untill patch 3.2 comes, of course. Then his guild will clear it in one day. Then he'll go partying again ^^</div></div><hr />

See I can make ridiculous claims based on the other camp's lifestyle too, does this make me cool?

Hmms seems like you know this dude or something. Your getting your undies in a bundle over nothing really.<br />
<br />
Arena for pally's is lawl, and PVE in this game has gone to crap.<br />
This requires one thing time, and a lot of it.<br />
I would rather do other things with my time then waste it on EEEEEPPPPPP<br />
Sorry to say. Gratz, but really find something better to do man.<br />
<br />
Go out find a nice hooker, and just enjoy the time is all I have to say.<br />
<br />
I think it's funny that some make this dude seem like some god.<br />
If anyone needs a life it's those people.<br />
<br />
<br />
Way to completely miss my point. But, judging from the post, you won't understand what I mean anyway, because you belong to the same group of people I was adressing. No matter what the achievement of someone is, nobody has the rights to cheapen it, insult the guy just in order to feel better about their own lives. This is no value judgement from me. It's psychology.<br />
<br />
Life = sex, and nothing else, eh? I thought humans were a step above rabbits. Guess you prove me wrong there.</div></div><hr />

Mate, i don't disagree with you, if he's the leader of a top raiding guild, let him be. My venting was directed at achievements and how people see them as Electronic Penis meters. That's the problem i have with them. If this dude has the time/life to do all these, then let him. :)<br />

Yeah, the concept of achievements as a whole is dumb. However, they also track some of the stuff that actually matters, like realm firsts. I don't congratulate the number of achievement points - I congratulate the dedication of the guy.</div></div><hr />

Also, to the people who doesn't like achievements: you don't have to do them if you don't like them. Although I don't know why you despise them so much. It's like hating a certain race just because &quot;they look ugly&quot;. Grow up a little.<br />
<br />
Anyways, congratulations to Zoltan. ;D<br />
<br />
EDIT: Now that I think about it, people seem to hate achievements because they use it to measure skill. I agree, it's just completely stupid. However, just avoid those people. That's the only tip I can give.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladislavius</div><div class="date">2009-07-18, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate achievements. I believe that &quot;link achiev or no inv&quot; spam is just rubbish, ask the person if he has done said instance, and if not, inv him and explain the fight!<br />
<br />
its a great way to check if the person done the fight before, futhermore i (and most of the people) dont want to waste our time to explain fights to MORONS or LAZYASSES who cant google/wowwiki them, lets add the fact that most people need to wipe atleast once (after watching the movie) to actually understand whats going on, and that if you have more than 4-5 people like that in the group this might be a looooong run- i pefer to require people linking archivements.<br />
<br />
<br />
What are you proud of? Of spending night after night wiping on bosses, to show people who go out, have fun with their friends, have a real life, your hard mode achievements?<br />
you can have full glory of ulduar 10 and most of 25 and have a real life, just get a COMPETENT group(note: competent does not mean &quot;lol we wiped- lets try again !'', no ite means 'we wiped, lets check recount to find out why !''), show up on time, with consumables and watched movies about the fight- voila. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's becoming racism, where people discriminate you in a guild application/raid invite if you haven't spend days wiping to get some hard modes.<br />
<br />
if you need to spend DAYS wiping to get SOME hard modes archivements that either you/ or your group are heavily handicaped- honestly its not THAT hard to get lets say, heartbreaker, lev with 3 towers 9thats not hard, but not as easy as normal one either), assembly, freya, hodir thorim<br />
<br />
however i do agree that archivements are a great way to 'flex' ones epeen if he/she wants to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The same goes for anyone else praising or flaunting this type of worthlessness around.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day when you go to sleep for the few hours before you wake up and start playing all day again, ask yourself, What does any of this matter? What did I actually accomplish?<br />

You can say that about any possible hobby out there. It is the guy who does it himself that gives it the meaning of accomplishment. The most favourite small pleasure of one's life is what really gets them waking up in the morning. That is how human beings are made.</div></div><hr />

Have all those people achieved something &quot;important&quot;. Not really. They just did what they did because they wanted to.<br />

<br />
and yes, it needs dedication, a good guild but most of all: TIMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEE. and in the end you get nothing out of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hardly bashing. I am just saying what is proved to be true from psychological aspect. And, judging from you going overly defensive with the ad hominem again, you know it to be true. But, since you are unable to dispute that, you instead attack me.<br />

With the 6 80s and 4 70+ on my main server i got 11515points, but i was lazy about archievements.<br />
<br />
I find it amusing how people bitch about other ppl and how they spend their leisure time. Maybe it was fun for him doing all these achivements, for me farming archivements (as every kind of farming in wow) is more work than fun and so i skip it most of the time. People find pleasure in different aspects of this game.<br />

well, see it as you want (thats what you do anyway) but stop the comment-section elitism. get some proof before you come along with &quot;psychological aspects&quot;. you will never be able to talk for the &quot;people&quot; because everyone is diffrent. <br />

About achieves in general I have the same opinion I ve about religions and many other things in life, I like them I just dont like what ppl do with them.<br />
<br />
Asking ppl to link achieves to invite them or not its so flawed... any alt around or rerolled toon has less achieves then a main or a former main and still there are many ppl playing badly since vanilla with lots of achieves like reps many ppl dont care, tons of quests in Azeroth when it was harder to lvl up, and the real no life achieve 'Server First &lt;insert here race/class/profession&gt;' at least those dont grant points.</div></div><hr />

Those were not my words, you see. Those are words out of a psychology book. You know, written by psychologists. That research people's behavior. I think they will know a thing or two about human behavior and the causes behind it.<br />
<br />
People aren't all that different. The individual is, yes, but on a large scale, there are certain personality types, that come with variations, making you see everyone as an unique being. It's the variations that differ, but the core is largely the same. Believe that you are a special snowflake, if you wish. But there are methods in dealing with every personality archetype. And there are qualities that are always present there.</div></div><hr />

All I have to say there are better things to do in wow.<br />

I have better things to do with my time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Better things to do in WoW? 10k achievement points literally means having done ALL things in WoW for the most part. Having more toons might be better to do for you and that's fine. But don't tell me he has nothing better to do in the game at this point.<br />

Top raiding guilds are better than you and I. Their sh@t might stink, but they have a sense of dedication and community to 'beat' the game.<br />

Humans want one thing sir. That is to be remember. If anything everyone try's to do something to make everyone know their name. Everyone is so scared to die. They cannot help, but fear being forgotten. So they do things, but you choose what to be.<br />

Cool attempt at creating a portrait of a personality you have never met IRL. Sadly, it is at the level of scrying trough a crystal ball. You simply can't evaluate a personality of someone, without having a direct conctact. I know you were trying to retaliate or whatnot, but scrying trough a crystal ball isn't exactly at the same weight as a scientifically proven cause of bullying and ridicule for the entirety the mankind has been standing upwards.<br />
<br />
And then there is a barrage of ad hominem personal attacks. Good argument you have there, that's how you prove your truth.</div></div><hr />

Hmms seems like you know this dude or something. Your getting your undies in a bundle over nothing really.<br />
<br />
Arena for pally's is lawl, and PVE in this game has gone to crap.<br />
This requires one thing time, and a lot of it.<br />
I would rather do other things with my time then waste it on EEEEEPPPPPP<br />
Sorry to say. Gratz, but really find something better to do man.<br />
<br />
Go out find a nice hooker, and just enjoy the time is all I have to say.<br />
<br />
I think it's funny that some make this dude seem like some god.<br />
If anyone needs a life it's those people.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, he just has more intelligence than you.<br />
Arena's for any class are lawl at the level you and I compete at. He is in the high end, it isn't lawl for him there.<br />
If PvE is crap. Please link me all your Ulduar Achievements so we can see that you have beat this crappy game. Doubt you have even seen any of the good hard modes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Funny how you say he is wasting his life yet he is enjoying himself and that is what we all should be doing in life. How you enjoy yourself isn't the law. Maybe he thinks wasting all that cash on getting drunk is stupid? How would you know he doesn't have a life outside WoW? He pays for WoW, internet, etc etc somehow.<br />
<br />
All in all. All the &quot;lol no life.&quot; posters are either immature teens or low self esteem adults. Either way both have a lot to learn about life.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gratz Zoltan. 10k is not just a display of time spent but skill and dedication also. I couldn't do it myself.</div></div><hr />

I'm just going to call him a waste of a life. It's sad that someone puts so much time and effort into something so meaningless. If he had put all this work into something in real life, he'd probably do a lot of good for the world. I'm not going to blame him though, I'm going to blame Blizzard for implementing this whole achievement system as it's got a real tight grip on people with OCD.<br />
<br />
The same goes for anyone else praising or flaunting this type of worthlessness around.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day when you go to sleep for the few hours before you wake up and start playing all day again, ask yourself, What does any of this matter? What did I actually accomplish?<br />

10k baby Oh yeah!&quot;<br />

Did that guy actually flex his e-peen? Did he ask for recognition? NO. He does what he thinks is fun. If you die and rot, all the accomplishments in the world won't make a difference. That guy, however, is happy and does what he likes. Better than most people that sit behind desks all day cursing their boss, or unemployed guys that were too lazy to work hard and get a better life. So, tell me who's happier? The average employee, who slowly loses his ambition and dreams, or that guy, that does what he likes and is content with his life?</div></div><hr />

By making people think. Much more than I've ever seen from your shitty posts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, you made me think a bit... And I thought that you post nonsense. I can tell you that you're shitty, or that you should get a life, but that won't help the world. Moreover, you think you make people think. How? You don't provide arguments. Until you dok, you're just a troll that can't hold to an intelligent discussion. I said that you have no right to flame another person that can't participate to a discussion with you because he isn't there, and that by doing that you're discriminating. Prove me other wise. You need to, else you'll look even worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You've clearly done very little in your life if you think there's only working in a cubical, hating your job or being unemployed, playing video games.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes I haven't done much, but that's because I haven't even gotten to the start of the important part of my life yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes. It is possible to find a job and be passionate about it. Sadly, not everyone has the chance, and due to reasons not depending on them at all. Note the current economy. Even the low grade jobs are short on supply, and unless you were settled well in before the recession hit in, there isn't all that much to choose from in order to pay those bills.<br />
<br />
If you have a job that you enjoy, good on you. But a well fed man can not understand the hungry man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;He got 10k achievementpoints in wow - must have no life&quot;<br />
&quot;He got all the top grades - must have no life&quot;<br />
&quot;He got the big job promotion - must have no life&quot;<br />
&quot;He got only muscles - must have no life&quot;<br />
&quot;He got a big musical contract - must have no life&quot;<br />
<br />
I think you catch my point by now.<br />
<br />
As someone else said, trying to reduce others accomplishments is just a reflection on yourself. Shape up your own confidence and your own lifes and one day you will realise that you can give reckognizion and applaude someone for a good job done. Regardless what its about.<br />
<br />
As for all you people who keeps saying the PvE / PvP achievements are easy, i must have missed your links to them...</div></div><hr />

To the ppl telling him hes a no-lifer.. <br />
<br />
Some ppl stand in IF/Dalaran or what ever town, doing nothing but just chatting. He probably does not.. If you look at hes armory you can see that alot of achievements were done @ 15oct/'08.. Other words, he most likely started playing way in the beginning.<br />
<br />
If you have a decent guild.. You clear raids faster as someone mentioned first.. Some people were actually done with Naxx OS and Maly after 2/3 weeks. What to do with you spare time? Go have fun get achievements.. <br />
<br />
MMORPG is about your char. How good you make your char. So you get everything there's possibly to get.. <br />
<br />
There´s this nice post placed yesterday, about min/maxing. About having always the best of the best items enchanted/gemmed with the best possibly to get. ISN'T THAT THE PURPOSE OF A GAME? Beating it? Giving your all? Doing everything there is to do?<br />
<br />
But well, people are just like that.. If someones better then you, hes bad, does not have sex, does not have friends, and has no life, or is a moron.</div></div><hr />

Those were not my words, you see. Those are words out of a psychology book. You know, written by psychologists.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't like to see people telling him to get a life but I don't like people like you either Eversor. Zoltan has used his free time to achieve something he desired. Something which doesn't hurt anyone. But you on the other side use all your time to pretend to be someone you aren't. You talk about psychology like you are a scientist but a real scientist wouldn't simply use a 'psychology book' as a source but he would cite the source in APA style or a similiar style. I'm not a scientist either but I at least don't try to pretend like I'm one. You do like to pretend like you're above some of the posters here but still you pick a side which makes you as bad as any of them.</div></div><hr />

No 10,000 HKs, Heroic: If Looks Could Kill (I guess kiting those eye beams in a small room is hard), Heroic: Getting Cold in Here (I would this this wouldn't be too hard). He will most certainly dip below 10,000 achievement points when 3.2 hits as the achievements for getting emblems is getting converted to feat of strengths (but he will probably make that up again on the first day by doing the new achievements).</div></div><hr />

Dude, if you played from the start. And you play 5hours a week.. You can have done A LOT, and i mean A LOT. If you tune the time up to some more.. Maybe for him it's Wow&gt;Tv.. How long do you watch tv a week? 15hours? More? <br />

Edit: Shit, I just saw I was quoting before. Thought it was one of the trolls here. Sorry and deleting my previous post.</div></div><hr />

Zoltan has used his free time to achieve something he desired. Something which doesn't hurt anyone. But you on the other side use all your time to pretend to be someone you aren't. You talk about psychology like you are a scientist but a real scientist wouldn't simply use a 'psychology book' as a source but he would cite the source in APA style or a similiar style. I'm not a scientist either but I at least don't try to pretend like I'm one. You do like to pretend like you're above some of the posters here but still you pick a side which makes you as bad as any of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can do with evidence. Here (http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%95%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%81%2C_%D0%90%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%9F% D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87) is the wikipedia link to the author of said book. Sadly it is in russian, so you might not get a whole lot out of the link. But there are listed his books. They are a good read, would suggest anyone to read them.<br />
<br />
On the the topic of low self-esteem being the reason to bully and ridicule, the best I can currently give you is a Wikipedia link to the main topic, however it is said there that there are little evidence to suggest that, so I am ready to eat some crow on that regard. However, Wikipedia is also not the greatest source of information as we all know, but I am willing to stand corrected on this one, should I be proved wrong.<br />
<br />
Now, on the subject of me pretending to be something I am not, you are partially correct. I am not a psychologist. However, that is what I aspire to be. Since I am still in high school, I see little ways for me to be anything else but a highschool student with some small knowledge in psychology. However, that little knowledge has quite helped me to reason human actions I observe every day from a different side.<br />
<br />
I might come off as just trying to preach people what they should do. The intent behind my posts is to make others understand the wrongness of such behavior, and how gaining (or protecting) self-esteem at the expense of others is wrong. Everything done at the expense of other human beings is wrong, at least in my opinion. Call me a hippie if you want, but that is what I believe and that is what I will stand for no matter what.</div></div><hr />

As quoted before, this is the truth. People with more free time in WoW are generally the ones people are most envious of. They hide this fact by insulting them.

<br />
Raising your own self esteem at the expense of insulting others is extremely pathetic. The saddest thing about it, though, is that many people see doing this as nothing bad. Maybe they just don't understand the reasoning behind it. I don't know. But it just saddens me. This is why humanity is so damn miserable all the time - we don't even understand ourselves properly and hurt ourselves and others out of sheer ignorance.<br />

You cant really blame him for playing a game he likes, its surely better than all of the whineheads that spend 10h afk everyday in IF, while they are qq'ing on the forum about pve, pvp, next expansion and apparently the new deal is to mock ppl that actually like to play the game.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't matter if he is or isn't, either way, 10k is a lot of waste time, plain and simple.<br />
By making people think. Much more than I've ever seen from your shitty posts.<br />

<br />
Think of midsummer, having to put out fires, all that travel, got annoying after a while? Well, imagene completing 2 continents, then doing it all over again the same day, and again, and again, n the next day, n the next day. Then come and say &quot;enjoying the game&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Lol, the guy loves the game. It's not really obsession, over half of these achievements can be done by just about anyone but he's the one that thought &quot;hey, instead of going afk in IF for half a day waiting for a raid, maybe I'll get some achievements&quot; and there you go, he got his 10k achievement points.</div></div><hr />

Why do people compare this game to real life? When blizzard says wow is over, its over. Its deleted. When you stop paying for your account, its over and eventually deleted.<br />
<br />
The gold medals my children get, the ribbons, the awards, the memories they get will last them a lifetime. No one can take them away or delete them.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but my daughters will get medals based upon their own merits and no one in their right mind would judge them on having one medal or 10,000.<br />
<br />
Comparing achievements to real life is a sad, sad, sad justification for the time lost. Especially considering blizzard is the only one making a living from all that work.</div></div><hr />

How ignorant do you have to be to think this person could have a life outside of wow to reach this achievement? We're talking about world of warcraft here.. we're talking about beating everything, killing everything, doing every quest, doing every raid and every raid hardmode and plowing through to many server firsts. Just reaching lvl 80 server firsts alone meant playing for 3+ days straight with no sleep.<br />
<br />
That isn't what most people consider a normal gaming life nor experience.<br />

1) So you don't get memories because your medals is virtual? Noone can take away being the first to get 10000 points regardles if the games continues to be played or not.<br />
<br />
2) Do you honestly believe that? : p really?<br />

3) Well. to me, a piece of metal is a sad way to validate what hobby is worth persuing to which is not. Just because you get a shiny ribbon it doesn't mean you get your lost time back.</div></div><hr />

20 years from now when your own kids are grown up, are you going to really be admiring your 10k achievements? will it even be a blip on your radar? You may very well have a box of medals/ribbons in your basement collecting dust but when your kids kids are growing up you can share those memories. WoW will be meaningless.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Do you honestly believe that? : p really?<br />
<br />
<br />
Not even sure where you're going here. Care to explain?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Well. to me, a piece of medal is a sad way to validate what hobby is worth persuing to which is not. Just because you get a shiny medal it doesn't mean you get your lost time back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still not sure where you are going. Someone claimed achievements to be akin to medals. I spoke about how they're drastically different because medals are tangible assets that you are given. The competition you win it from can't delete the game and wipe it all out. Its something you can share with your kids, youre grand kids. It is vasltyy different and its sad you can't recognize that. There is definitely a sense of competition in wow but its a short term successs. Blizzard owns it, blizzard can (and will) delete it and in the end something newer and better will come along.</div></div><hr />

This game matters not in the real world and its probably 3 years /played to get 10k achievements on one toon. Seriously.<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't cure cancer but i'm raising two beautiful girls, have a beautiful wife and family, pay my mortgage, pay my bills, travel the country and still play the game and have fun.<br />
<br />
This &quot;Achievement&quot; is meaningless.<br />
<br />
It´s about time you realise that just because sombody likes something that you don´t like doesn´t mean that they are stupid.<br />
<br />
The only thing I see in post that say &quot;Zoltan has no life&quot; is: &quot;I´ve already made up my mind, don´t confuse me with the facts.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
HUh?<br />
<br />
I never said anyone was stupid. I will however agree 100% that unless Zoltan steps up to the plate and answers the threads here that he indeed has no life. What is there to debate? To get every achievement he has he has to have farmed the entire game and i know people with 2+ years /played and they're not anywhere near as close. Not only that but being an achievement whore AND a GM its damn IMPOSSIBLE to have a life and by a life i mean RESPONSIBILITY, JOB, AMBITION, LOVE.. you know - everything that wow DOESN'T OFFER.<br />
<br />
Sorry if that offends you. I think you read to much into the facts and try and turn them around to make me look bad when i'm just stating the obvious truth.<br />
<br />
Grats to 10k.. woopiddidididid dooo is my point. There are crazy kids pushing over 100k points on Xboxlive and to hae beat 100+ games from start to finish requires NO LIFE. <br />
<br />
while an impressive feat fore sure.. and a sign of dedication.. its just not what 99.9% of people would call a life.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodlusted</div><div class="date">2009-07-18, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How ignorant do you have to be to think this person could have a life outside of wow to reach this achievement? We're talking about world of warcraft here.. we're talking about beating everything, killing everything, doing every quest, doing every raid and every raid hardmode and plowing through to many server firsts. Just reaching lvl 80 server firsts alone meant playing for 3+ days straight with no sleep.<br />
<br />
That isn't what most people consider a normal gaming life nor experience.<br />
<br />
You want proof.. ask the 10k'er himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
You realize that we have no proof, huh? Until we find some, you are as ignorant as I am. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
eh, medals for his kids, are more than that, its being in shape too n leads to a healther lifestyle maybe as an adult.<br />
<br />
Getting 10k achiev...riight that leads to what? dependency on his mom while he is still 40?<br />
<br />
<br />
Who are you, his mom? Leave the guy alone, you are flaming him while he does not even know of this thread.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">haiitsme</div><div class="date">2009-07-18, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You just happen to stop by the gaming forums within those 10hours a week to tell people that getting stoned and drunk is much better than achieving something in their favorite hobby.<br />
<br />
You are all wrong. <br />
<br />
I have been on these forums for about two maybe three years, i have an account since start Jan '09 (Something like that anyway). And i have played a lot more then just 10 hours a week, it's just (The ten hours) how i play the last months and next ones probably. And i am not telling anyone what is better for them or what's not, i am just saying people should stop being bitches and cry because others have something they do not. <br />
<br />
Actually, i don't really think you read what i wrote.. Neither i think you read what i quoted and reacted on. That guy/girl told me how i lived my life, while i do not know him/her. So i am simply saying that's not true.<br />
<br />
Really read again and see for yourself. I am actually congratulating this guy for hes 10000 points as it's something i most likely won't ever get, and i would not mind having it. Thumbs up for the dedication.</div></div><hr />
