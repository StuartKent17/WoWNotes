It looks like the mage was hotfixed yesterday to make a few changes to the Arcane tree<br />
The Arcane Blast buff is now instantly consumed by Arcane Missile to prevent people from clipping their cast to get a boosted Arcane Barrage too.<br />
The Glyph of Arcane Blast (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44955) now gives 3% additional damage and doesn't work on Arcane Missiles anymore.<br />

Agreed on that point. It's true but still good that they fix it &quot;fast&quot; (For blizzard standards) :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
First what? First fix? Or are you trying to be lame and post what everybody else can already see (since it appears at the top?)<br />
<br />
On topic: Lets hope summoning is fixed like the say and hopefully they wont break a lot of things now the game is finally stable again (at least for our battle group).</div></div><hr />

wasn't meant lame, but more as a joke/boredom at work :)<br />
<br />
And summoning should be fixed :( Now all we need is more raiding warlocks on my server</div></div><hr />

That's the whole point, even if the risk is minor, downloading from MMO-Champion will never be as safe as the Blizzard Downloader.</div></div><hr />
