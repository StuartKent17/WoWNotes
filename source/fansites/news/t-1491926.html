They are pretty much all quest rewards and dungeon loot.<br />

That's what it looked like. Still a bummer though. Was genuinely hoping for a loot experience that wasn't like grinding the low levels of WoTLK, or as generic as Pandaria/Cata's reskins felt.</div></div><hr />

The looks? I can't even... This crappy item design has plagued this game since post WOTLK, few items/sets aside. I understand these are most likely leveling greens, but I really hope this...savage/rocky/boney/undersized/oversized/tusk theme is dropped quickly when we move into epic quality items. I mean at this point, after all these years judging reception and now data with transmog, they should have a good idea of what players want in the size of a 1 handed axe for example.<br />
<br />
Blizzard should be focusing on sets they know will kill it. Stop going for the narrow-minded dungeon's theme at the cost of making it look too specific. Go back to class themed loot. Was all of Molten Core's Tier fire themed like Firelands? No. Is it to this day one of the most popular transmog sets? Yes. You know how you keep people playing more than making actual side content and daily zones? Make them HAVE to get their gearset because of the looks. Make all gear the same quality of challenge mode gear. It might take longer, but you'll have happier players in the long run. A common theme I hear is that we're willing to wait the time while you polish your expansions and patches, and please take the time on the single most important thing in this game: gear.<br />

According to wowwiki/wowpedia I believe his left hand is the correct hand, so its the artwork that was drawn wrong or it was mirrored. The first time he was drawn in the Warcraft 2 manual it was his left hand that was a blade.<br />

If you look carefully, the vast majority of these weapons/armor are just slight variations of the MoP gear. I even see some WotLK and Cata variations. What happened to the days of Blizzard actually putting out unique looking stuff? Come to this of it, that seemed to only be BC. But we're going back to the same world, this is a whole new world for Blizz to make exciting and unique weapons that no one has seen before, because it's an alien planet. They really need to fire all their art designers and get some new blood, cause this is just getting sad now.</div></div><hr />

Shoulder are super underwhelming. Certainly not bad, but they look really, *really* similar to some WotLK ones (I'm almost positive that the brown plate ones were dropped in Naxx - I'm going to assume it's a placeholder).<br />
<br />
Overall not bad, especially for quest / dungeon loot. Generally the tier loot is a higher quality than the leveling gear, so I've got pretty high expectations for it.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
huehuehue<br />
in MoP there are 2 leveling sets, 1 dungeon set per Armor type(12) and then one crafted high lvl pvp set, Mogue/mantid raid, zandalari set, SoO set, Challenge mode set X 11 classes.<br />
<br />
That is 67 Unique armor sets in this expansion.<br />
<br />
Your argument has no basis in anything even remotely appearing to be a shadow of a falsehood of truth<br />
<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
Anyways, since I was actually LOOKING at the gear with a critical Eye i noticed something interesting.<br />
<br />
Each item seems to be from one of many aesthetics likely belonging to a different faction.<br />
For instance there are items made from bones and wood (likely frostwolf)<br />
Some made more savage using stone, wood and crude metal (probably the gear from around the savage tribes like kilgrogg and Warsong)<br />
Some that almost look like Druid gear. Various serene plants and foliage. I'm guessing its either Araokka or from the jungle area (my third guess was it is Shadowmoon valley theme)<br />
Then there is the obvious Blackhand gear that is industrial and reminiscent of SoO<br />
And naturally the Draenei gear<br />
<br />
a great place to see them all side by side is in the shields. Seems to be a set from every faction on draenor.</div></div><hr />

Moving on... Nothing about the item models really stick out for me. The overall theme, with some exceptions such as the offhands, is practically shouting &quot;Cataclysm&quot;.

Agreed. I was hoping the &quot;Hobo Wars&quot; theme of the last few PvP sessions would finally end, not continue wholesale in to weapon/armor design for an entire new expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think some players are experiencing an over-glut of &quot;grim and gritty&quot; item design. What I mean is that its 5th expansion now and the whole &quot;Epic&quot; feel of weapons and armors is slowly becoming less epic as it moves on. It is kind of hard to put it in word really, The clothest I can get to explaining this is picking those new shields for example and comparing it to Royal Crest of Lordaeron.<br />

The books on chains?<br />
<br />
There are several &quot;book&quot; models available for transmog in the game for off-hands (http://www.wowhead.com/item=22253#same-model-as). (And several more not in that list, some of which I do believe are on chains, for whatever that's worth.) This one in particular looks quite libram-y:<br />

I'm sure Kargath is finished, though it's obvious that Kilrogg's clothing isn't. However, I'm fairly certain they're going to end up looking more or less like that. <br />
<br />
It's worth noting that these models are positioned to be standing rigid for modeling purposes; this isn't going to be their &quot;default&quot; animation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well this post is full of Wrong and &quot;I could have realized this by myself if I tried.<br />
<br />
1. the models have no animations tied to them, that's why orcs have that &quot;stupid&quot; blank expressionless look on their face....cause its actually blank....and expressionless.<br />
<br />
2. Ancient orcs? these are a generation ago. Better weapons? Garrosh took Blackfuses technology plans and weapon construction methods. What do you need to build the parts and weapons and blades for these tech monsters? Just as advanced smelting and construction methods. The Iron Horde have superior weapon creating forges and smelters (seeing as a whole CLAN has situated themselves around making them and their (soon to be dungeon/raid) fortress is one big weapon manufacturing plant, its safe to assume that the orcs realized &quot;holy shit we can make some sweet ass blades using these smelting/forging methods!&quot;.<br />
<br />
At the same time, they're a race making a huge technological jump. So how they imagine weapons to look and be made will still translate into the weapons they create using advanced methods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways, things that do stand out imo are that Warsong Clan shield which is pretty awesome to have if you are into lore and it looks pretty cool. I think they should have more items that represent each of the clans. Also, Boubille did datamine a fist weapon that was an actual warglaive (not the same model as illidan's but different) along with a weapon version of Kargath's bladefist which was insanely huge. You folks prob wont believe me, but he did. Not sure why it wasn't posted up here, though :|</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure what you're talking about, we've had the gritty gear aesthetic since wotlk. Much before cata. Getting mad over it isn't really worth the effort. We did get a break in MoP though, most of the MoP gear has been beautiful asian aesthetic. Draenor is all about savage so i doubt you'll find much satisfaction there, but I think as long as they make the gear look ferocious but SIMPLISTIC, then i'd be okay. Although, they do have more holy draeneic and exotic arrakoan gear though. It's not all just orcs and spikes.</div></div><hr />

You got Paladin gear with tusks on it now, you look like a Hunter. And not even a Dwarf Hunter, like a Troll or something. What the hell is the sword from these past two seasons even supposed to be? It's got like a giant jawbone riveted to a jagged chunk of obsidian, with a handle rammed in there and some knick-nacks glued on to the side. Congratz, it's a swerd!

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pacster</div><div class="date">2014-04-07, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well this post is full of Wrong and &quot;I could have realized this by myself if I tried.<br />
<br />
1. the models have no animations tied to them, that's why orcs have that &quot;stupid&quot; blank expressionless look on their face....cause its actually blank....and expressionless.<br />
<br />
2. Ancient orcs? these are a generation ago. Better weapons? Garrosh took Blackfuses technology plans and weapon construction methods. What do you need to build the parts and weapons and blades for these tech monsters? Just as advanced smelting and construction methods. The Iron Horde have superior weapon creating forges and smelters (seeing as a whole CLAN has situated themselves around making them and their (soon to be dungeon/raid) fortress is one big weapon manufacturing plant, its safe to assume that the orcs realized &quot;holy shit we can make some sweet ass blades using these smelting/forging methods!&quot;.<br />
<br />
At the same time, they're a race making a huge technological jump. So how they imagine weapons to look and be made will still translate into the weapons they create using advanced methods.<br />
<br />
Oh really brainiac? You think I didn't notice that they are without animations? Hey, smartass...pictures are ALWAYS without animations. Does not change that they look as stupid as can be and that they won't look like Einstein with animations.<br />
<br />
Whatever garbage you are telling about weapons...there has never been a significant tech jump(and you have such a tech jump since orcs left draenor) after which the weapons have been worse than before that tech jump. NEVER. You can say that ancient japanese swords are better than those that people created during WW2...but that is cause people simply had BETTER weapons than swords so they did not care as much for swords.<br />
<br />
So next time, please THINK before acting like Mr. Know-It-ALL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those weapons look like stoneage weapons. That would be fitting the fact that we go into the past...the only problem is that those weapons shall be better than anything we have now....and that is a deal breaker(and Blizz will never be able to explain to us why ancient orcs got better weapons(that on top of that look like weaker weapons) than many years later). If the weapons keep this theme then this definitely is the expansion where I thank god for transmog...<br />
<br />
It's a gameplay mechanic, weapons are made to look so that they fit the theme of the expansion and the stats are just a gameplay mechanic, in lore a weapon from blackrock depths is just as qualified as a weapon from wotlk because in lore they don't have levels and talents and stats, once again, just a gameplay mechanic.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellrod</div><div class="date">2014-04-07, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I think you can agree that it just got more and more egregious as MoP went along, effectively culminating in the WoD preview we have in-game now. You got Paladin gear with tusks on it now, you look like a Hunter. And not even a Dwarf Hunter, like a Troll or something. What the hell is the sword from these past two seasons even supposed to be? It's got like a giant jawbone riveted to a jagged chunk of obsidian, with a handle rammed in there and some knick-nacks glued on to the side. Congratz, it's a swerd! And that's typical of what we're seeing here.<br />
<br />
Most likely because these are questing greens. And trust me, questing greens in BC were just as bland, just not as spiky. Instead of criticizing, i'd rather find stuff in this that I DO like. Some of my favorites are the following (Note: you may have to drag the images into the url bar to get a better look at them)<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/april/taxe13.jpg<br />
<br />
I think that's pretty inventive lol. A warsong orc broke your mighty MoP epic so you hastily fashion it into an axe and re-engage in battle. No matter what you guys might say, that actually is a creative weapon we haven't seen before. But i do think there needs to be a model of the fixed sword as well. It looks nice.<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/april/tmace01.jpg<br />
<br />
If you honestly think that looks spiky and savage then i think you need some glasses, sir.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's atleast one more image i wanted to post, it was of this nice looking warglaive that was datamined during the stream but boubille didn't post. So frustrated because of that :mad: oh well, you'll probably see it when beta releases or the actual game. Anyways, these are questing greens, not raid tier. These types of weapons/armor always have had the least amount of work put into them ever since BC (I would say vanilla but that doesn't make sense). So to say they looked the best or had the most potential isn't true. They all look like bland vanilla greys. <br />
<br />
If you have concept art for weapons, im IMPLORE you to send it to Blizzard. They're more than likely to take a look at it, as they have borrowed concepts from players before such as The Darkmoon Carousel. Same to any other artists out here throwing a hissy fit. Wait for their next art contest or just draw some cool looking gear and send it to them whenever. They'll take a look at it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arialonos</div><div class="date">2014-04-07, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in the same boat as a lot of people on this thread (models look similar), but disagree with some of the comments (not unique enough). I can clearly see the Aroka (sp?), frost wolf and bloodmaul influence in a lot of these weapons. Look at the bows for instance. You have the oversized (ogre) ones, the ones with tusks (winter - frost wolf theme), and the ones with feathers/leaves (dranei or aroka-(bird people)-sp?). Same as the shoulders, i see the influence of the various cultures and races in them. And the last shield? Looks like it was a door ripped of a hut, that's badass.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see is something high-tech from our dranei friends in dranor. The race is obviously advanced seeing as they came to aseroth in space-ships. Give me some fucking space-like gear/weapons that look advanced. I DOUBT space-ready races are still building shit with stocks/rocks. I want to see metal alloys with lasers and pew-pew shit!\<br />
<br />
The CM paladin gear is kinda the theme I'm referring to for dranei tech. Put a cool/sleek gun with that and it would be badass. Minus the bird style shoulders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example, this version of one of the 2-handed sword models is, to me, gorgeous.<br />

I like a lot of these as beginning blue PvP stuff or just simple questing items. You can only be so creative for stuff that doesn't matter, to a point where you can't make everyone happy and having to make badass questing greens would take time away from more important stuff.</div></div><hr />

You should know by now that if you don't want to be spoiled you don't visit MMO-C or at least skip the news post that say ALPHA, BETA or PTR. And &quot;I don't think we should..&quot; I'm fairly sure that we have very little to do with the datamining. Sure you could complain to Chaud or Bibi but at least Bibi has been doing this for years and I don't see him stopping. And some of us just want to be spoiled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People need to just calm down about these models. If you read through the Wowhead items, there are a huge amount of randomized stat weapons and gear. The Blizzard art team uses these very generic models for the randomized stat weapons/gear because it's too hard to design theme around them. The more iconic weapons will come later, which are designed around theme. You can tell these are quest rewards/randomized stat weapons/gear because of the coloring, the same coloring style that leveling gear in Pandaria used.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, some of these aren't bad and will be used in mog sets. But these are less iconic because generally they last one zone max, before they are replaced and sold. Plus, the amount of detail on these is pretty impressive, even compared with Wrath/Cata/Mists leveling gear, with a lot more shading and a lot more personality, TBH. You definitely get a #savage feeling looking at these, especially the ones where you are basically wielding a jawbone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We care because quest gear has the least effort put into them, as they should, considering the fact that they are the kind of stuff that randomly drops off of trash mobs and world npcs. The stats on questing greens are usually bad and they only make good vendor trash. The point is that we are glad the low quality gear has low-quality looks (although there are some gems here) which still saves potential for epics and raiding tier.</div></div><hr />

This is barely the alpha, these are models that are in the game half a year before they're due to release it. You can tell by the 4-5 different recolors per item that they are meant to be generic. Calm down until the game is in beta and the first raid is out. For what it's worth, some of this stuff looks pretty neat and you can see the duality of the orc/draenei designs.</div></div><hr />

Beyond the gear, though, what worries me is the epic sameface that is going on with the warlords. Durotan and Grommash looked somewhat different, but these two look like a pallete swap and a glue-on beard are the only differences between the two.</div></div><hr />

Look, I know they're worried about the &quot;clown-suit&quot; gear. So am I, but the solution is not to make everything grey&amp;brown. We have transmog now, so make interesting and visually stimulating armor and if people think they look goofy or too colourful they can mog it.<br />
<br />
Also can we stop having weapons with horns, spikes, random metal bits and fire on them now? Of the weapons the crystalline stuff is quite nice (maces/swords/staffs in particular). Nobody wants to use a grey rock glued to a brown tusk as a weapon. Nobody. Let's have some of the colour and outrageousness of the Wrath and TBC models back.</div></div><hr />

I think your being a bit harsh to blizzard they are working there best and yes there is some weapons and armor and shields mad of wood and iron because guess what orcs use wood an iron and if they didnt use wood and iron it would break the lore also there is weapons made of crystal and armor made of furs nd metal.

I completely agree people are being exceptionally harsh towards blizzard. I don't remember ever getting such cool items from quests ever the items from quests have never looked cool and never something people would transmog, this i would transmog and i think this is showing blizzard going in the right direction with armor and weapons. I also dont see how people are comparing this to MOP because MOP was very oriental themed or had weapons that were Sha themed this is weapons and armor with spikes and Iron and fire coming out of them it is very cool the art we have been shown.<br />

Every person I see almost always transmogs to BC/Vanilla weaponry, probably because those looked like the most plausible of designs.

YES. I've felt this way since WOTLK, but I gave that expansion a pass because it was supposed to be a gritty, scrounge-anything-you-can kind of expansion. Did WoW happen to get a new art director around LK or something?<br />
But then again, they seem to have a hard-on for big burly he-men, so I don't think they are into graceful and sleek. Can't have those burly menfolk looking silly with a dwarfed but normal-sized weapon grasped in their sausage-fingers, can we?</div></div><hr />

Some horrific looking weapons. Why do they insist on making every weapon since Cataclysm look like a toy? Can't we just have a simple, sharp and slender sword? I'm sure the gear is going to end up being pretty cool but holy shit batman, these weapons are just straight up dumb. I find it strange how WoW has such beautiful environment design yet continues to have horrific gear design expac after expac. Bulky weapons do not look cool. None of these weapons look remotely real or functional. They used to be able to balance the cartoony aesthetic with seriousness but that has been thrown out the window for comic book level flashiness. My dwarf is probably gonna continue wielding the IF maces from the Argent Tournament.<br />
<br />
ADDENDUM: It's entirely possible that most of these are going to be NPC weapons for more savage enemies like the pale orcs we've seen, in which case tying some broken swords to a stick might actually make some remote sense. Still, not a fan of the design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But why is it okay for green questing gear that will be reused for more than likely EVERYTHING other than raid gear to look absolutely horrible? That's the gear that will FLOOD the expansion, that will be reused when they get lazy for another Timeless Isle epic gear model holder, and random drop world greens. That's the gear we will be in for a majority of the leveling process, on all of our characters. It's the first gear the players get to see and put their character in when they begin the expansion. <br />
<br />
I can understand keeping things simple and not turning them into challenge mode gear, but that does not mean that every single weapon has to look like a 6 inch thick poorly carved spray painted piece of foam that looks like a child's cosplay weapon or some medieval themed Nerf accessory.<br />
<br />
The shoulders are even worse. The first plate ones are probably just a placeholder, because they look EXACTLY like ones we saw in Wrath. And many of the others look incredibly simple and boring, or like previous gear sets that had everything stripped off of them and all of the textures removed with a lower poly count.<br />
<br />
Just horrible.<br />
<br />
I've had complains about a lot of green gear, and many about Wrath. I don't like the tacky simplistic &quot;stone&quot; and wood weapons that look like cardboard and foam, but if you're going to go that route don't even bother adding any color to them or giving them a fluffy feather here and there or even any hint of shape at all. Just leave it simple and acknowledge that you don't care what they look like. <br />
<br />
I actually enjoyed the mist weapons. I remember loving the dragon staff and quite a few of the daggers, and the polearms, and the swords. They looked so ornate that they looked less like crappy greens that somebody just threw together because they didn't give a shit and more like someone put ACTUAL effort into them.<br />
<br />
They've been stuck on this style for quite awhile now, and the gear seems to be getting worse and worse. I'm not really sure what happened, but I was hoping that gear would start looking better after the pretty impressive pvp gear we got at the end of Cataclysm (with a few exceptions.) and the challenge mode gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
But I guess raids and trying to jump through hoops to find challenge mode groups will seem more worth it if everything else you release is utter crap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking back over them. I see one staff, one polearm, and one bow I would even begin to think about using. Aside from that, complete garbage.<br />
<br />
They're so concerned about &quot;immersion&quot; but then they create an endless number of weapons that look duller than a plastic spoon. A giant, grey, swirly rainbow spoon that for some reason has to be 6 inches thick. I dare say a spork looks more intimidating.</div></div><hr />

I strongly suspect the sword that got broken, &quot;fixed&quot; with duct tape and handed to some hapless chap before it even cooled down so that the handle needs a covering of asbestos wolf fur is going to be a raid drop or at least HC5.</div></div><hr />

Whoever did the modeling for BC.... they need to bring them back. These weapons just look like more of the same with slight variations.<br />

yay, more items that are made of wood &amp; rocks. Looks so great...NOT! Just as boring as all MOP items. What happend? Given completely up ?<br />
<br />
My feelings exactly. As boring (and ugly) as MoP weapons. It does seem like they gave up or stopped trying to make weapon models that don't require a mog to look good.</div></div><hr />

Just something to prove that not all the previous expansions had bland weapons. (everything on the right side are WoD weapons but it was cut off a bit.)<br />
<br />
Infact, Cata had the most simplistic, and elegant weapon out of them all as the image shows. BC has the most bland. It's very basic with no real design put into it. MoP, contrary to popular belief, had the most unique weapons because of the asian aesthetic which provided for alot of decorative and beautiful gear. The only really gritty expansion was WoTLK and that was mainly with the ICC patch in weapons like Ghoulslicer which invovled too much metal, death skulls, or spikes.<br />
<br />
WoD is using the savage look to fit the theme of the expansion for orcs and humans. they do have some nice looking weapons tthough such as that mace, the bow, that shield with the Warsong Clan symbol, and a bunch of other stuff. I'm surprised you guys are ignoring the gems like that. Such a shame.</div></div><hr />

This is because Blizz was using high fantasy style when bc came out but for Wrath they switched to this style that they are using now.</div></div><hr />

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and not everyone likes the Asian aesthetic. It's a weapon, a tool, it should be simple. I liked the TBC and WotLK models personally. It's hard to really form an opinion on the weapons in WoD because so far it's all quest reward models, which have their good and bad visuals in every expansion. So far I see similarities to Cata in the weapons I've gotten in beta, with rock and crystal design on them. The polearm I picked up in the first area was very different from the swords in your example image though, had a lot more detail.</div></div><hr />
