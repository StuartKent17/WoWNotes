Mana Tap talent looks exactly like Soulburn Haunt, Improved Soulfire 4.0. An obligatory buff to maintain.<br />
Do you think talents are a good place for gameplay styles that some people enjoy and some people don't? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/704579767786299392))<br />
<br />
I'm gonna ask you a question anyway.Can hunters please tame rams? Something for my hunter to have along side his mount.<br />
Usually we try to add models that have had uprezzes these days, maybe someday (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704942719215468544))<br />
Good to know. When I caught a glimpse of the PvP Ram, my Dwarf-o-meter went off and I wanted to see more of that high-rez glory.<br />
Yaks are close! And fuzzy. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704943141976195072))<br />

when will blizz fix the undead model and by model I mean scaling of gear (or how it looks on Undead vs other race). #SHOULDERSRSOSMALLSADFACE<br />
are you seriously a player playing a warcraft game complaining that your shoulders are too small (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704956236567949312))<br />
on Undead, yes! On everyone else, no! Plate gear on undead looks so &quot;spread out&quot; and not compact.<br />
One of them definitely hangs off of the shoulder a bit, thanks for the feedback. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704956840128356352))<br />
<br />
will T18 set bonuses be adjusted once the Legion prepatch drops? Several modify talents that won't exist or will have moved<br />
Yes. The set bonuses for Tier 18 will be adjusted. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705190332879630337))<br />

What is AV/Wintergrasp lasted an hour or two? You'd talk with the peeps.<br />
Ashran was a Good Experiment. Drove PvP forward, got feedback, glad we did it. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704948022283739138))<br />
And I'm not sure this is 100% true, I loved 48 hour AV (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/704948408893743105))<br />

The amount of honor per level increases every 10 levels. At the moment, going from 1-50 takes 50,000 honor. (1/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/705482012723818496))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
then again the group finder makes it as trivial to find random group and it works. I am not getting you entirely here.<br />
The point of group content is to work together as a group. Excellent matchmaking works against that because it's so easy to bail. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/706924287878279168))<br />
As a player, sure it's easier if you don't have to communicate and just hit a button to find another group. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/706924365691035648))<br />
But is that healthy in the long run? Why have a multiplayer game if everyone plays it as a single-player game, you know? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/706924465037266944))<br />
<br />
Was there originally a plan for Crystalsong Forest in WOTLK? Seems to desolate...<br />
I think it was Dalaran, which was in that zone, being too much of a resource hog. Was long ago - I may be misremembering. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/706924965099012096))<br />

Beta will start when this xpak launched. They tinkered with thE concept in WOD having the players pay $15 a month for a beta instead of free testing .<br />

I'm not aware of a single point in any game where &quot;ran&quot; to rhyme with &quot;can&quot; is used. A few devs have used it at Blizzcon and the like, but I think Metzen's always used &quot;rawn&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Nothing really, the &quot;A&quot; is either pronounced stronger, or weaker to sound like &quot;ah&quot;<br />

I kind of like that the undead look lanky, and smaller shoulders help towards that type of appearance. What they SHOULD do is implement different body types for each race. Most MMORPG-type games have options for that. I wonder if blizz would ever consider adding a few preset body sizes/shapes for each race. Would be really cool!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shangalar</div><div class="date">2016-03-14, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference in the two choices is that there are people who pronounce Dalaran as either Dalar-ahn (all the 'a' sounds sound the same, like the 'a' in 'bar') or Dala-ran (the final 'a' sounds like ae, as in 'cat', or to be exact, like the past tense of the verb 'to run', which is 'ran' as in I ran away from my enemies). There's also a southern US way to pronounce, where the first 'a' would also be ae. Just pretend you're from Texas, it sounds like Delahren.<br />
<br />
The correct pronunciation is the first one, all three As are like bar. The questions was there just to see how people pronounce it, not to determine the correct one.<br />
<br />
However, I'm afraid that because of the large international public that WoW enjoys that the two choices in the poll aren't clear enough for the average English as a second language player.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a native English speaker, but it just makes sense. I also think I heard it pronounced like that ingame several times.</div></div><hr />

Except there's a clear difference between Alpha and Beta though. The fact they said Beta suggested that they would have everything ready for testing and would still be in the process of it by the end of the year. The fact Legion is actually in Alpha is a big difference. I mean they still have entire zones that are unfinished and unimplemented.<br />

Ghostcrawler has somewhat of a point but he forgets that for the vast majority of players before group finder WoW was already a single player game because you couldn't get into groups with anyone to even do group content<br />

I don't know about you but back in Vanilla on Dentarg EU it was really easy to get a group together to do group quests and run dungeons. Heck I spent a long time at level 20 on my Druid so that I could chain run Wailing Caverns with different groups for the Embrace of the Viper set.</div></div><hr />

Surely from the LFD experience we had in WOTLK it would have given you some insight as to how LFR would be, aka, the elitist, the DPS meter spammer, The afk'er after just clicking the button, Then ninja etc.<br />
<br />
LFD, not sure about LFR, was actually one of the main things that GC developed and pushed very hard during Wrath. His comments now are admissions that what might have seemed like a good idea at the time (though there were plenty of us that expressed contary opinions back then), in retrospect, actually wasn't good for the game. <br />
<br />
In fact, when they introduced LFD they took away the global Looking for Group channel that players used to watch / post in to find a group...they defended this on the basis that it was always full of spam (which wasn't true at all on my server or at the very least depending on your server no worse than other global channels) when the real reason was they wanted to ensure that players didn't have an easy alternative way to find groups and adopted LFD. <br />
<br />
That and the original incentives to do LFD killed individual group formation. They did ultimately add some of the functionality of individual group formation back but its still not as easy and straightforward as the global LFG channel was.<br />
<br />
Blizzard always ignores the fact that as the creator of these incentives to do particular activities in particular ways they &quot;force&quot; the desired result. Participation in Garrisons being a prime example. But for the incentives the participation rate would have been much lower. But Blizzard, in defending Garrisons or other &quot;forced&quot; content always falls back on participation rates to defend them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the dev's myopically expect the best kind of behavior from players, and don't understand when they get the worst, which is why to this day they still create content that can be abused, even simple things like having a quest item be blocked by large mounts. <br />
<br />
I guess nobody would want to admit that their core audience is a bunch of entitled jackasses who will abuse, cheat and complain about everything you make. <br />
<br />
And, the systems don't make people anti-social - the players do. They'll be anti-social no matter what you do.<br />

He was mostly making a joke? In the past players have largely made fun of WoW for having unnecessarily huge shoulder plates. The idea someone was saying they were too small in any circumstance most likely amused him.</div></div><hr />

the one next to the gold sword is lothar's sword. not frostmourne.<br />
From left the right are King Llane's gold sword, Lothar's Black Dragon sword, and standard stormwind soldier sword?<br />

<br />
The sword on the right in the image you posted is the sword the royal guards carry. <br />
The typical Stormwind foot soldier carries a similar, but less intricate blade.<br />
<br />

<br />
The blade on the right of the table is the standard guard's sword, the one beside<br />
it with the hilt facing the other direction is the type from the picture you showed-<br />
that of the royal guard.</div></div><hr />

yeah it cant be frostmourne just from the fact that it was forged by demonic powers out of unknown metal as far i got the lore behind. but i must say at first glace lying there i was tricked to.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't even remotely look like frostmourne. The only thing they have in common is both being bastard swords.</div></div><hr />

Why so ? Its a normal Cross promotion and hurts no one and for those who have all the games anyway its free stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OMG! I am so with you on this, I use old BC and Vanilla Weapons... since all the new weapons are just INSANE in size... its just like Blizzard is run by &quot;women&quot; which focus just on size!!!<br />
<br />
Everyone knows... its not about the size... but how you use it! ;)<br />
<br />
PS: Weapons Should be smaller in size... or maybe implement a way to make weapons bigger or smaller (blacksmithing),<br />
<br />
PSS: Immersion is everything in an MMO, so lets have shields and weapons that acctualy look like we could carry them in real life!</div></div><hr />

No, GC has accepted responsibility for this mistake BUT you are right -- they did mock people who criticized them harshly.</div></div><hr />
