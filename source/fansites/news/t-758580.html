Cataclysm Beta - Build 12942 Hunter Pet Changes<br />
This build revamped most of the pets abilities with a very simple goal, make pets useful. The result is a more active pet for Death Knight, and an insane amount of possible raid buffs for hunters depending on what pet they have.

If you ever dreamed about your pet having tons of possible abilities, your dream probably looked a lot like this list. <br />

Golden King Video Preview<br />
Kody (http://www.worldofraids.com) released a short video preview of the Golden King, the Alliance lion guild mount. It currently costs 200 gold and require your guild to have the Dungeon Diplomat (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5126/dungeon-diplomat/) achievement. The blank spot on the lion is supposed to display your guild tabard but it is currently bugged on beta realms.<br />

How Archaeology works<br />
Ghostcrawler explained how Archaeology works on official forums, there is also a very nice post from MortalWombat on our forums with a couple of extra information and tons of screenshots.<br />
<br />
How Archaeology Works (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/758212-How-Archaeology-works.?p=8797043#post8797043)<br />
<br />
<br />
Archaeology just went in this build for the first time and we don't yet have any of the support around it to teach players what to do. It has been informative to watch players learn to swim by drowning, but we thought it was time to offer a little more direction. :)<br />
<br />
Digsites<br />
Once you train archaeology, you can see digsites on your map (not your minimap - your map). There are always 4 digsites per continent. These will not change until you dig one out. Most of the time, you're probably only going to be concerned with the 4 sites on your current continent, but at higher character and archaeology skill levels, there will be 16 sites active at one time (4 each in Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Outland and Northrend.)<br />
<br />
You will only find sites in zones of your level or lower. A level 25 player will have all 4 sites per continent in level 25 zones. (This means Outland and Northrend will have no sites at this time.) A level 80 player will have all 4 sites in any zone. A low level Kalimdor player might have sites in Ashenvale and Stonetalon, while a level 82 might have Uldum, Ashenvale, Stonetalon and Silithus.<br />
<br />
Sites are race specific. You can usually guess the race by the location. Kalimdor tends to have a lot of night elf ruins. Eastern Kingdoms tends to have a lot of dwarf ruins.<br />
<br />
Some races are only available on some continents (such as orc and draenei on Outland). You need to have a minimum character level and a minimum archaeology level to use these. Currently you can see them if you are a certain character level but can't gather from them until your archaeology skill is higher. For Outland, the skill is 300. While somewhat consistent with other gathering skills, we think this is confusing and we will change it so that you don't even see the digsites until your archaeology skill is sufficiently high. Tol'vir artifacts are the most rewarding, but also require near max archaeology skill to recover.<br />
<br />
Some players are reporting some issues with digsites not showing up correctly. We'll look into these bugs.<br />
<br />
Unlike other gathering skills, digsites are player-specific. Other players will be searching in different locations. There is no competition for digsites.<br />
<br />
Fragments<br />
Each digsite can be searched 3 times before it despawns and a new site spawns. If there is a digsite somewhere too far away from you or otherwise inconvenient, just ignore it and hit the closer ones. You won't run out.<br />
<br />
To search a digsite, use the Survey ability. The survey tool will spawn and point in the approximate direction of the artifact. Red means you're far away. Yellow means you're close. Green means you may be within 40 yards or so. When you discover your find, you'll get fragments specific to a particular race.<br />
<br />
There are two main strategies to surveying. You can attempt to triangulate by moving around the outer edge of a digsite. (Like quest blobs, the digsites are not necessarily circular.) Other players just keep surveying, heading in the direction the tool points until they strike paydirt.<br />
<br />
Remember, the thing you uncover is yours. There is no competition with other players and nobody can gank your node.<br />
<br />
Artifacts<br />
Whenever you get a new fragment for a race, you'll start a research project. You can only work on one artifact per race at a time. When you have enough fragments, click Solve to complete that artifact. You won't waste excess fragments -- they will just start the next project. You can be working on one project for each race at a time.<br />
<br />
Most artifacts are common. These give you a little bit of lore or flavor text and an item you can sell for a small profit (presumably to a museum!) The profit increases as the value of the artifact increases. You can estimate this by the number of fragments needed to finish the artifact. You will only find cheaper artifacts at low level, but you can find cheap and valuable artifacts at higher level (the reason for this is we want players to be able to find all the artifacts if they want to). You won't find a second copy of a common object until you have found all the artifacts of that race. If you get stuck at a certain skill level of archaeology or character level, you may find an artifact more than once until you reach the next tier.<br />
<br />
Some artifacts are rare. These always make a blue or purple item. Many of these have no in-game power and are toys or for flavor. Some of them are actual weapons and armor. The latter items are all bound to account. They aren't heirlooms in that they don't scale, but you can pass them around. So if you are level 80 and you find a level 60 axe, you can always have another character use it when they are level 60. You will never get a rare artifact more than once.<br />
<br />
The future<br />
We designed archaeology to be easily expandable, so we plan to add much more content in future patches, including new races to research (though to be fair, there's a sizable amount of content already). We also have a feature that is not available on beta yet, that allows you to use your archaeology skill for a slight (think Fish Feast-level) bonus in the Cataclysm dungeons. <br />
<br />
Random Character Services Buttons<br />
In the latest build players will notice paid character services buttons appear next to characters at random on the Character Selection screen. These are the buttons you would normally see after purchasing any service, such as race, realm, or faction changes, or character customization. If a character service button shows up next to one of your characters, you can click it to make use of a free race change or character customization (faction change coming soon). You can make use of these buttons as often as you like, but the services for which you’re selected are randomly chosen for you and will update every hour. So, say if you don’t want to change your race but would like to customize your appearance on a specific character, you will need to wait for the right button to appear.<br />
<br />
Please note that these buttons are only for beta testing purposes and are not intended to be released for free on live realms. We want beta testers to stress test our paid services so we can ensure they are operating smoothly when World of Warcraft: Cataclysm is released. <br />
<br />
<br />
New Flight Skill<br />
Just in case you missed it.<br />
We’ve added a new flying skill called Flight Master's License. When World of Warcraft: Cataclysm is released, players who purchase the expansion will see this skill available from flight trainers for 250 gold once they reach level 60. This new skill is required for flying around all Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms zones, including the new level 80-85 zones. <br />
<br />
<br />
Battleground Titles and Achievements<br />
Honor titles have been added into World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. These titles are earned when specific Battleground Achievements are completed, and are triggered when specific Battleground rating milestones are met. The titles remain the same as the original PvP titles, however, players who obtained these titles from the original Battleground ranking system will not lose them. The Feats of Strength associated with the original titles have been altered slightly to denote that they were earned under the old system, although the titles themselves remain the same.<br />
<br />
As of now, the first ranks -- Private for Alliance and Scout for Horde -- are earned when a player reaches a Battleground rating of 1100. The ranks increase every 100 rating points, up to Grand Marshal/High Warlord at 2400 rating. Titles earned through the new system are yours to keep and will not be wiped with each season.<br />
<br />
In addition, all-new titles and Achievements will be added for top performers. Hero of the Alliance and Hero of the Horde will be awarded to players who finish a season in the top .5% of the rated Battleground ladder. These titles will be wiped at the end of each new season, however, a new Achievement will be awarded to players who earn this title each season. Let’s see how many seasons in a row you can stay in the top .5%! <br />

Rated Battlegrounds Min Level<br />
It's limited to 85's. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726065601/question-about-rated-battlegrounds/))<br />
<br />
&quot;Old&quot; Battleground Titles back in Cataclysm<br />
As you noted in your edit, the original titles are not going to be taken away from players who already have them. The Feats of Strength associated with the old titles will be changed slightly to more clearly distinguish them from the Achievements associated with the returning titles.<br />
<br />
Here's a brief rundown of how the rated Battleground titles will function in Cataclysm, and how the original titles can be earned by players who did not have a chance to participate in the original ranking system:<br />
<br />

Guild Leveling / Perks<br />
Guild Perks on Beta<br />
All guild perks should be working as of today's build except for Happy Hour and Chug-A-Lug. These will both be active in our next build. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560866553/cashflow/))<br />
<br />
Mobile Guild Bank requirements<br />
You need Friendly guild faction to use the mobile guild bank. That is updated in the tooltip for the next build. There is currently a bug where it is set to friendly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560866553/cashflow/))<br />
<br />
Guild Raids &amp; Dungeons Achievements<br />
In general we require 80% of the group to be comprised of guild members. There are exceptions to this case though like 40 man raids and arenas. All the gritty details below are below.<br />
4/5 - dungeons<br />
8/10 - 10 player raid, 10 player BG<br />
20/25 - 25 player raid, 25 player BG<br />
10/40 - 40 player raid<br />
12/15 - 15 player BG<br />
2/2, 3/3, 5/5 - Arenas (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560501163/guild-achievements-for-classic-dungeons-raids/))<br />
<br />
Guild leveling on beta<br />
This feedback is extremely useful guys, please keep it coming. A few things to note:<br />
<br />
-XP is currently not being earned for all the dungeons, only Throne of the Tides, Blackrock Caverns and The Stonecore are giving XP. In our next build, ALL dungeons going back to classic will give guild XP. Guild XP gained from bosses is based on the bosses level and is modified by things like the number of players in your party/raid and if the encounter is heroic or not.<br />
<br />
-XP is currently not being given out for rated BG's. (obviously, since they are not on beta)<br />
<br />
-XP is currently not being given out for Achievements. This will also be implemented in our next build. Note that guild achievements give large amounts of XP at a time and for this reason, they will not respect the daily cap.<br />
<br />
-XP for quests if working correctly and most of your leveling has been based off of this alone so far.<br />
<br />
-As far as rep gain goes, you need to remember that rep gain is based on your guild xp contribution. As you can see from my notes above, you currently only have one way to contribute, quests. Once our next build goes live and you can earn guild XP from boss kills, this rate should increase. You can expect a similar increase from rated BGs. Before you ask, guild achievements do not grant guild rep since they are earned by the entire guild.<br />
<br />

Arcane Blast changes in Build 12942<br />
It goes a little beyond that, as the arcane blast debuff only affects arcane blast. Essentially, arcane blast is the highest sustained dps (but unsustainable in terms of mana), followed by arcane barrage, followed by arcane missiles (which is very close to arc barrage in dps, and free of course).<br />
<br />
So, from the standpoint of a boss fight arcane is less about a constant rotation, and more about optimizing your mana bar to the fight you're involved in (with a little rng in the mix). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702262953/mage/))<br />
<br />
Combustion<br />
In the next beta build combustion's instant damage is guaranteed to crit. Not only does this mean ignite is guaranteed to be instantly re-applied but also that you have a shot at a hot streak to re-apply pyro. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702262953/mage/))<br />

Selfless Healer<br />
The damage buff to Selfless Healer is intended to make using Word of Glory less of a dps loss. It's just giving you back some change. It isn't intended to be a mandatory talent, and it would be hard to keep the buff duration up all the time time anyway. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726065305/retribution-lacks-choice/))<br />
<br />
[...] If you had read a little more before running to the forums (armed with only data-mined information I might add), you would have seen that using Selfless Healer will still be a dps loss. That is the intent. The change is just to make it less of a dps loss than it was previously. Giving up a Templar's Verdict is a lot for a paladin. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725725376/holy-pallies-nerfed-again/))<br />
<br />
Inquisition<br />
You should use Inquisition when you need to AE tank, since it will boost the damage on Consecrate and the Holy portion of Hammer of the Righteous. You should use Shield of the Righteous on single targets. If you get a proc, you might decide to use Shield of the Righteous even on larger groups. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435176608/protection-paladin/))<br />
<br />
Holy Paladin &quot;nerf&quot;<br />
What you call nerfs (and buffs) I call class balancing that is being done during beta. End result will be a working class that can fulfill it's role.<br />
Yeah, pretty much this. Since you don't really have anything to compare it to (in that you aren't seeing your character on live suddenly healing for less than she did the day before), it's hard to get too upset over seeing numbers go down. Some of the numbers are just too high right now. It will all even out before we're done. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725675201/holy-paladin-nerfs-12942/))<br />
<br />
[...] We wanted going to melee to benefit from Seal of Insight to be an option you might consider on some fights. With the previous numbers, you would be stupid to play any other way, which was not our intent.<br />
<br />
We were seeing too many paladins use nothing but Holy Shock -&gt; Word of Glory and be effective at doing so. The intent was to give paladins more healing spells to use in Cataclysm, and this mechanic was dominating too much. It will still be quite effective.<br />
<br />
The other concerns seem to be about mana and throughput number changes. It's too early to worry about those yet. It will be some time before we feel like the numbers are stable enough. We'll make sure paladins have about the same mana regen as the other healers. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725675201/holy-paladin-nerfs-12942/))<br />
<br />
Does Haste affects Judgement of the Wise/Bold?<br />
Yes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726035546/haste-effects-jotw-and-jotb-right/))<br />
<br />
Sanctified Wrath (Yep, I screwed up. Rank 3 didn't change = didn't show up on my side. You can call me stupid)<br />
* Sanctified Wrath is now a Tier 4 talent, down from Tier 5. Now increases the critical chance of Hammer of Wrath by 20/40%, down from 25/50% and reduces the cooldown of Avenging Wrath by 20/40 secs, down from 30/60 secs. <br />
I *think* this is a data-mining error. This implies we removed rank 3, which we have not done. It's still 60% / 60 sec at max ranks. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725955368/ret-build-12942/))<br />
<br />
Seal of Command<br />
It improves the damage of these 3 Seals. The cleave only applies to Righteousness. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725955368/ret-build-12942/))<br />
<br />
Art of War Change<br />
The overall damage is lower than TV now, which was the goal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725955368/ret-build-12942/))<br />
<br />
Retribution Mana management<br />
Ret doesn't need a lot of mana to do the basic rotation. They were getting so much mana that they were doing things like casting Exorcism a lot, using Consecrate on cooldown and using expensive heals. A little of that is okay, but it should be a bonus when you get a lot of mana, not something you do all the time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725955368/ret-build-12942/))<br />

Shield Slam Damage<br />
We need to shift some of the damage from Shield Slam to Devastate and Revenge. It's fine that it hits like a monster, but it shouldn't totally dwarf everything else. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725675142/worried-about-ss-revenge-devastate-balance/))<br />

Heroic Strike in SMF on Beta = Bug<br />
Heroic Strike doesn't interact with either Bloodsurge or Single Minded Fury.<br />
<br />
Bloodsurge can only be proc'd by Bloodthirst. SMF only affects Slam (and damage). The latter just has some goofy tooltip bug in your build. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726035459/warrior-changes-12942-and-t11-bonuses/))<br />
<br />
Haste scaling<br />
Not everything needs to scale with haste (or crit for that matter). They just need to scale well enough that A) the stat isn't viewed as garbage on gear, or B) that Fury (in this case) doesn't blow past Arms at high gear levels. <br />
<br />
[...] Haste does not affect Rend ticks. Our general philosophy is that melee dots do not need to be sped up. Melee benefits from haste by generating more resources. Thus, there should be no Taste for Blood losses with haste. Rend can crit however.<br />
<br />
Since I can probably guess the question that will get asked next, Slam also won't scale with haste. However, we have changed Blood Frenzy from being passive haste to a chance that your autoattacks will generate extra rage. This should help Arms scale with haste a little better, as well as give Arms a slightly less predictable rage income (in the way that crit used to deliver, but without the crit scaling problems).<br />
<br />
We're not worried about Heroic Strike ever beating Slam. If that happens, it's just a tuning problem easily solved. <br />
<br />
[...] We want haste to apply to as close to 100% of your damage as possible. For casters it always applied to cast time spells. Now it also applies to dots. For melee, it improves your auto attack damage but also grants you more resources, therefore improving your special attacks as well.

Cataclysm Zone Q&amp;A: Ashenvale<br />
<br />
Q. What was the original concept for the zone?<br />
A. The concept for Ashenvale was to show the effects of the Cataclysm while taking the opportunity to streamline the zone's level design. There were areas of Ashenvale that were pretty unfriendly in terms of accessibility and quest flow. The level designers and quest designers worked together to alleviate the problem areas and highlight the big changes.<br />
<br />
Q. Who will be using this zone (what levels/factions)?<br />
A. Both Horde and Alliance players, roughly from levels 20–25. We anticipate that this will be a well-traveled zone in terms of general player flow.<br />
<br />
Q. Without giving up any spoilers, what's the general storyline for this zone? How has it changed from the original design?<br />
A. Among other catastrophes, an enormous volcano has erupted in central Ashenvale. As the night elves struggle to deal with the chaos caused by the Cataclysm, the Horde is seizing what it perceives to be a golden opportunity. Garrosh Hellscream's forces are now bearing down upon the night elves and have overtaken several key positions that once served as Alliance strongholds. There is a definite feeling that the balance of power in this region now teeters on a goblin tripwire….<br />
<br />
These changes also mean that Horde players will have much more to do in Ashenvale.<br />
<br />
Q. What do you think is the most exciting new feature of the zone?<br />
A. Visually, it has to be the volcano. It's stunning, and it provides a great landmark in a place otherwise known for its dense forest. Thematically, the tension present in the zone gives it a whole new feel. The Horde is barricaded inside the walls of Splintertree Post under a massive assault by the night elves and their allies. Meanwhile, Astranaar is desperately fighting off waves of Hellscream's forces. Practically everywhere you go in Ashenvale, it's impossible to escape the fact that it has become a warzone.<br />
<br />
Q.What goes into redesigning a zone like this?<br />
A. A bit more than meets the eye, we think. Ashenvale is deceptively large, and previously there were many issues in terms of quest flow and Horde/Alliance content balance. Soon after we rolled up our sleeves and broke ground, we realized that our work was cut out for us. There were numerous quests we wanted to keep, but there were also a great many that no longer fit or didn't play out efficiently. We also needed to create a variety of new quests, especially ones &quot;For the Horde&quot;™.<br />
<br />
Q. What was the most challenging aspect about implementing these changes?<br />
A. It can actually be a bit tougher to come in and &quot;do surgery&quot; to an existing zone than it is to completely gut it and start from scratch. Given our ambitious time constraints, trying to determine what stays, what goes, and what other changes to make is certainly a challenge.<br />
<br />
Q. What should players do or go see first?<br />
A. Horde players should visit the Mor'shan Rampart first. There's a new Horde contingent there who is fighting hard to make sure that no night elves escape Hellscream's onslaught -- not that they'd make it far into the Northern Barrens! Alliance players who come down from Darkshore will want to help defend Maestra's Post and Astranaar as both settlements struggle to keep from falling under Hellscream's control.<br />
<br />
Q. Who seems to have the upper hand in the zone: the Horde, the Alliance, or the elementals?<br />
A. The Horde and the Alliance are throwing themselves at each other on many fronts; neither has a clear upper hand here. The elementals in Ashenvale are a minor nuisance in comparison to the faction struggle.<br />
<br />
Q. Should we expect any changes within Blackfathom Deeps?<br />
A. There are no significant changes planned for Blackfathom Deeps at this time.<br />
<br />
Q.What has happened to Silverwind Refuge?<br />
A. The Horde has happened!<br />
<br />
Q. What has changed the most: the storyline or the terrain?<br />
A. The amount of change has been pretty equal between storyline and terrain. The terrain is much less frustrating than before, and the visual results of the Cataclysm tell the story as much as the quests do. Story-wise, the theme hasn't changed so much as its intensity has.</div></div><hr />

You do realize it's pointless to bring that pet if you have a mage or shaman in your raid right?<br />
Frankly I welcome these pet changes, going to make it a lot easier to make 10 man raids as a hunter can substitute any missing raid buff that we'd lack.<br />
<br />
Though this will put more pressure on a hunter, with them having 20 (?) stable slots I can imagine some raid groups requiring their hunter's to get a pet with each of these buffs. Plus a lot of the buffs are only for BM hunter's, including Heroism one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cataclysm PvP is most likely going to be far different than it currently is, and adding in focus should actually reduce the amount of fast damage a hunter can do as they need to wait for it to regenerate to fire off the double chimera shots with readiness, for example.<br />
<br />
I think the changes to the pets is actually the best way to ensure that raid groups have the best chances of covering some of the more desirable group buffs, and it's going to mean Blizzard don't have to worry about balancing class composition again after giving it an additional group buff. Some of the group buffs are attached to exotic beasts also, so you'd need a Beast Mastery hunter for heroism, so it's not like a marks hunter it going to have personal access to it in PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It isn't unbalanced at all. I can see BM hunters being welcomed into raids with a core hound for this reason, especially if there's no shaman in the group already. For a while into the Beta I was really starting to frown at the hunter changes, but now I think they're started to look wonderful. Perhaps BM hunters won't be so bad anymore.<br />
<br />
And now I think Archaeology (Need to think of a short way to write this.) looks really exciting! Can't wait for Cata. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope they're going to give all horse like mounts the same animations as the spirit horse you can buy from the cashshop.<br />
<br />
Now why would you want that? Both the Celestial Steed and Invincible (Currently the only two horse mounts in the game with the same model.) look awkward and somewhat silly. Invincible less so than the Celestial Steed, but even so, they look strange and more like a pony than a horse. I'd like to see a revamped version of the original horse mounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally am not going to roll BM just for pet buffs. It's silly. I'll play the spec I want and get whatever pet I want. And then some people will feel the need to lose DPS for pet viability and diversity, and they will, and that's how they'll play. <br />

The other two spells are available to a class, this is a specific talent tree within a class. For a lot of Hunters this is going to mean either their primary or secondary spec will NEED to be Beastmastery, especially if your focus is going to be 10-player content. It just feels strange to force such a powerful buff on a single spec. Not to mention a specific *pet* within the spec.<br />

tired of seeing my wolf and for people that wine about it not every hunter is going beastmaster in a raid yes the buffs are handy but in a 25 man raid you got all the buffs in the raid that the pet provides so not really any use of a hunter bm there.<br />
<br />
its to fill up the blanks in most raids like 10 man because its shit that only a shaman, (in cata also mage) can do bloodlust because on some servers thre arent many of those classes around.<br />

Yeah I think the saving grace for this is that Mages are extremely common. I can't remember the last time I did a 10-player raid without one.<br />
<br />
So in that sense, it's not too bad. It's still a bit weird it's for a single spec though. I'd say it would be like adding the Blessing of Kings buff back as a talent, but they did that with an Exotic pet ability too. ;p</div></div><hr />

As long as being BM with a core hound is a sizeable personal DPS nerf compared to other pets/specs, I don't think it's very OP. It's more of an emergency solution if your 10-man doesn't have a mage or shaman.<br />
<br />
It might be OP in rated battlegrounds, though.</div></div><hr />

It's a collective achievement. I agree it does seem a bit easy so maybe they'll change it to require rep or cost a lot of gold too. Like I mention in my news post, the gold cost may not be correct at the moment because the reward window is kind of buggy.</div></div><hr />

I can't think of a way to explain it for some reason... But basically you have to just get exalted with each of the factions as a guild? So, let's say that you're exalted with all the factions but The Knights of the Ebon Blade, then someone comes into your guild who is exalted with that faction. You get the achievement. For some reason it's hard to explain, but I hope it helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to remember hunters will have 5 (I think 5, anyway more than one) &quot;active&quot; pets at a time they can swap between at any time outside of combat. And the stables will house even more pets, so you should expect your decent hunters to at least have one of each pet family standing at the ready.<br />
<br />
As for it being BM only, I figure they didn't want to make heroism too common either. 3 shaman spec + 3 mage specs and 1 hunter spec seems plenty to make sure it's available in 10-man raids.<br />
<br />
And to the guy saying you could make a raid with all dps being hunters, the opposite is true too you can make a raid with all buffs without any hunters. What's the point again?</div></div><hr />

I can see BM hunters being welcomed into raids with a core hound for this reason, especially if there's no shaman in the group already. For a while into the Beta I was really starting to frown at the hunter changes, but now I think they're started to look wonderful. Perhaps BM hunters won't be so bad anymore.<br />
<br />
And now I think Archaeology (Need to think of a short way to write this.) looks really exciting! Can't wait for Cata. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now why would you want that? Both the Celestial Steed and Invincible (Currently the only two horse mounts in the game with the same model.) look awkward and somewhat silly. Invincible less so than the Celestial Steed, but even so, they look strange and more like a pony than a horse. I'd like to see a revamped version of the original horse mounts.<br />
<br />
Im not asking for the same model,im asking for the same animations. The current galloping of the horse mounts looks incredibly inaccurate and awkward whilst the cash shop mount's animations look way more realistic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless I'm not following something, Monstrous Bite doesn't give any aditional damage. It's now the mortal strike effect, it's listed up there.<br />
<br />
That's kind of the problem here too. When talking about BM damage, you're comparing live damage to beta damage that doesn't currently exist since the gear to put into the spec doesn't exist? Really? Besides, at theoretical top-end it's 'only' 1.5k difference in DPS. Of course if it doesn't bring anything to compensate (which it currently doesn't), that's alot of wasted DPS and not justified, but no one has any numbers for what the spec will be doing at 85 in raiding gear. I imagine with the pet changes it'll be perfectly competitive and justified with the current live numbers.<br />
<br />
Then the oh noez heroism bit. On PvE terms it's as overpowered as any other buff listed. My GM with plans for 10man in Cata is a Shaman, so... suddenly the heroism bit isn't important at all because we have what's a great healer and fun person (!) with that button already. Maybe we'll have a Mage too, who knows. So then what you look at is what other critical buffs are missing, this in a 10man setting though you can actually miss something like Sunder in 25 if the only Warrior you have is DPS and doesn't want to / forgets. 10man though, no Warrior but a Feral and perhaps Death Knight tanking? Raptor for sunder, not even an exotic pet so you can be whatever special nonconformist spec you want and still have the sunder debuff raptor, which is a very big deal. Have a good stack of melee debuffs without your pet but casters are behind? Dragonhawk and Wind Serpent aren't exotic either, but provide a big 8% spell damage buff. <br />
<br />
Most of the buffs that aren't heroism and passive buffs can be gotten by any spec. This provides Hunters with the diversity they need and want in their pets and makes me very happy. It's certainly better than previous itterations where it was &quot;Oh cool, this pet can do the faerie fire debuff for us, but... it's only 40% uptime. Yeah, nevermind, back to Wolf or die.&quot; It also allows Blizzard to tune 10man hard-modes around having these things from some class/spec/scroll/pet rather than tuning around not having heroism or half the health/damage buffs, making the 10man heroics a pushover when you do have those buffs compared to 25man that's tuned around having and pushing everything the way they want to tune 10.</div></div><hr />

No, they most certainly WONT be a mandatory class. You still won't need to bring a single one. You'll still be able to field a raid composed entirely of paladins, if you want. <br />
<br />
The only classes that are mandetory, is that you MUST bring a holy/disc priest, or holy pala, or resto druid/shaman. You must also bring a tank, although there's a bit more choice there.</div></div><hr />

First of all, thanks for the insult.<br />
<br />
Secondly we seem to have very different opinions on what is OP. In a 25-man raid none of these abilities should make a difference, so no &quot;OPness&quot; there.<br />
Now in 10-mans these pet abilities will be useful, yet far from overpowered. You must have a very fucked up guild roster to need more than one hunter to fix your major buffs/debuffs in a raid. (Let's see 10 classes, 10 raid spots ... holy flying pig it makes sense.)<br />
<br />
As I said, you could use several hunters to bring these buffs. Just as you could make raids with all buffs without a single hunter. A 10-man guild will love their one good hunter, but I doubt they'd need a second one unless they want to bring the player (what's that saying again?)</div></div><hr />

It's not about a fucked up roster or raid composition. It's about that hunters will have a guranteed raidslot, always. And you're trying to say that a 5% crit buff, 8% spelldamage debuff, 4% physical damage, increased bleed damage wont make a difference when you dont have it in the raid? It's more utility than one single class in wow could ever bring, and if they still consider hunters a &quot;pure&quot; class, while treating others with the damage tax then fuck it.<br />
<br />
Looks like your previous raiding experience has touch you nothing. On some encounters in a 10 man raid your comp of 10 different classes wont be as viable as other ones, and this is even fact in 25 mans. There will be always some encounters which prefer one class more than the other, and what whould be the easiest solution? Replace the class which perfoms less good, and let the hunter do the debuff / buff if it's missing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This will be going live, for people that are saying it will not. Remember pets do not benefit from player buffs anymore. Blizzard stated they wanted to make pets more useful. And tbh hunters need to be able to bring some buffs. The ones they bring now, are easily cancelled by other classes, and they are in dire need of it.<br />
<br />
And your cat will get something. It keeps Rake, just the damage hasnt been modified yet, it will do the same damage as all pets will do. Pets will more than likely do the same damage across the board. (Of course BM being the exception, as the mastery is Master of Beasts, which increases your overall pet damage, so I wouldnt worry, your cat has a home still )</div></div><hr />

What is the point? All the fights are balanced around having all the debuffs/buffs anyhow, you get punished if you DON'T have them all. They used to be unique and interesting, now it's basically a given that your raid will have all of them.<br />

First of all hybrid tax has nothing to do with buffs. It's the ability to change roles. (Blizzard's words, personally I think the whole concept is retarded, but their game.)<br />
<br />
Secondly I say it's far too early in the beta to claim hunters will bring &quot;more utility than one single class in wow could ever bring&quot;. Talent trees are being changed daily and same goes for abilities. As far as we know every major buff COULD have at least 7 specs that carry it. (Like BL/Heroism in cata.) Then the &quot;major overpowered amount of buffs&quot; hunters bring will be a lot less &quot;majorly overpowered&quot;. Its usage would be then what I expect is intended, a way to solve slow raid nights or less pressure on social guilds. <br />
Now if anything I think hunters will bring less buffs at any given time compared to other classes, but will have a larger amount available on demand. Say a boomkin will bring 7 raid buffs, while the hunter only has 4. But the hunter has a larger variety it can change depending on raid comp. (Figures pulled out my personal ass.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like your previous raiding experience has touch you nothing. On some encounters in a 10 man raid your comp of 10 different classes wont be as viable as other ones, and this is even fact in 25 mans. There will be always some encounters which prefer one class more than the other, and what whould be the easiest solution? Replace the class which perfoms less good, and let the hunter do the debuff / buff if it's missing.<br />
I admit I stopped raiding in mid TBC (unless you call Naxx-25 etc raiding) and my major experience comes from vanilla when people were just very happy to have 40 people online.<br />
But if I understand the way most encounters work these days, they either benefit ranged (that includes casters and hunters) or melee on the meters and give the other role an important assignment for the encounter. Why would hunters be the class that magically is good in every situation and will benefit from this?<br />
<br />
And of course top guilds will find ways to abuse every game mechanic in their favour, if it's broken Blizzard will fix it after the first world first is &quot;stolen&quot;. No biggy. But I doubt a large variety of buffs (which other classes bring as well) will be &quot;game breaking&quot;.</div></div><hr />

What does that tell you about &quot;omg a buff can help us kill the boss&quot;? <br />
<br />
Also to people complaining about omg hunters gonna get an insta spot in raids now please grow up. If the guy is a retard and can't move out of a voidzone trust me he won't get one even if it means the group doesn't have BL although with mages/shamans find that hard to believe. Also progression guilds, even 10m ones, will get what they need be it a shaman a war or a hunter depending on the setup they will utilize. As some people said they can have full raids without hunters or have two if they think it won't affect the group dynamic. <br />
<br />
Tbh in cata blizz is centering more on the bring the player not the class stuff since almost everyone will have a truckload of buffs/debuffs that they can bring to make the group as complete as possible. Only choice left now is how effective is he/she at playing the chosen class/spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding the hunter changes, my first thought was, &quot;wow, this gives hunters a lot more versatility than any other class.&quot; I can understand why people might be worried, however on further pondering, I don't think this will change the determination of who gets a raid spot too much. Or at least, I don't feel it should. I can't really make any specific comments about the changes because Cata is still in Beta and lots of things will probably change between now and launch (and probably even after launch). <br />
<br />
If you were a raid leader, would you bring someone who is mediocre just because you need his/her buff? I know that I'd never give a hunter who can't perform his/her specific role a spot over a class that provides NO BUFFS but is exceptional at his/her role. On the more difficult content, while having every buff is nice, in the end it boils down to how much would the raid as a whole benefit from said buff versus how likely the buffer will actually stay alive and provide that buff. As an example, the Misery/ImpFF buffs are pretty darn nice, however if it's between bringing a provider who dies within the first minute of the fight versus running with 25 people who do not die, I'd chose the latter in a heartbeat. A bad hunter probably can't micromanage his/her pet well enough to keep it alive and continue to sustain the buff, to say nothing about the other liabilities he/she brings. On the other hand, an exceptional hunter would be brought to a raid anyway regardless of what pet he/she is bringing.<br />
<br />
That's of course an extreme example, but since Blizzard is spreading raid buffs out, the availability of options I feel gives more flexibility to raid composition as opposed to less. I don't agree that hunters will always be guaranteed a raid spot based solely on these changes to their pets.<br />
<br />
Finally, there's always the social aspect to consider. A hunter that annoys the hell out of everyone, even if he could bring all of those buffs at once, probably wouldn't be too welcome to a raid. ;P<br />
<br />
But yeah, too early to worry too much I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does mean that every hunter will now be dual specced to BM and SV/MM. It also means that starting a raid will require hunters / raid leaders to pay attention to what buffs are missing so that they can bring the right pet. Bringing a corehound with a shaman in the raid is a waste.</div></div><hr />

Kings on the other hand sounds more reasonable, since palies will just give other buffs like Might or Wisdom.<br />

That's not a pet issue. That's an NPC pathing issue I believe. The same thing that causes the boss to run behind the tank when he runs in.<br />

Anyone that's ever tried to grind a 5s team to high rating knows how mind-numbing and discouraging the task of keeping just FIVE people together is, much less a team of 10, 15 or 25. <br />
<br />
Queue times for rated BGs might be very, very long if you are at higher ratings. Perhaps what they could do is expand the rating range of potential matches in the first two minutes in queue, but equally decrease the rating change when you aren't fighting teams within 100TR of your BG Matchmaking Rating.<br />
<br />
And they'd better use Matchmaking Rating to manage Rated BG rating, since it works and they can carbon copy it. Anything else would be idiotic.</div></div><hr />

No offense, but if you think the only thing that makes the Shaman stand out was its ability to be guaranteed a raid spot (skilled or not) because of an oft-considered important buff to the raid itself, then I'm afraid you don't deserve the buff, either.<br />
Not to say there aren't really good Shaman out there. I'm just saying that I would rather be put on standby because we had a Shaman that was, for all intents and purposes, better than me than being put on standby because a Shaman is required with lust in order to clear the boss we're at currently. That is a situation we all would rather be in, I think.<br />
<br />
In the end, Hunters could very well never need to use Blust. I very rarely end up in a group that doesn't have either a Mage or a Shaman, but if I do, then I would gladly switch my spec to BM with a corehound in order to give the raid that buff. The only time we gain a benefit from it is when a Shaman or Mage is not in the group. If they are, then we're either using a different pet or using a different spec entirely, because there would be no point.<br />
<br />
Tying the ability into a pet that requires a spec to use is more like saying &quot;Hey, we're backup lust in case there is no Mage or Shaman in the group currently.&quot; It's not a game-breaker, and I can assure you that the Corehound will not be our top DPS pet. Not by a long shot. Even as BM, if we have a choice, we will probably still go with a Devilsaur if we don't need to provide lust, if the current game is any indication.<br />

The hunter pet changes are just going to make them the most annoying and OP class in rated BGs and Arena's.<br />
How do you figure? It's not like we're the only one providing the buff. Hell, if you wanted to, you could probably kill a Corehound really quickly without any concern, and then we're without that all-important buff. We can't use it without our pet alive. That's a disadvantage right there.</div></div><hr />

It's not about a fucked up roster or raid composition. It's about that hunters will have a guranteed raidslot, always. And you're trying to say that a 5% crit buff, 8% spelldamage debuff, 4% physical damage, increased bleed damage wont make a difference when you dont have it in the raid? It's more utility than one single class in wow could ever bring, and if they still consider hunters a &quot;pure&quot; class, while treating others with the damage tax then fuck it.<br />
<br />
Looks like your previous raiding experience has touch you nothing. On some encounters in a 10 man raid your comp of 10 different classes wont be as viable as other ones, and this is even fact in 25 mans. There will be always some encounters which prefer one class more than the other, and what whould be the easiest solution? Replace the class which perfoms less good, and let the hunter do the debuff / buff if it's missing.<br />
<br />
First of all - changing your pet comes with some special problems. For some buffs you need to spec into BM - on some bosses that may be the worst thing to do. Then with another pet you may not be able to perform as good as before, so the raidlead will NEED to look for all buffs from the usual classes. AND you have to GET all those pets before and get em to lvl 85 - not so easy. And only 5 pets per stable call - what's left you need to get out at the stable of a town.<br />
<br />
And I don't see the problems with the raidspot - on a 10 man and 25 man you always have a hunter with you - dosn't matter what kind of pet he has or will have. It's a nice change for random raids, if there's some class missing and their buff could be really usefull (like the moonkin buff etc.) so you could buff something you can't find someone for.<br />
<br />
And besides - I don't think they start stacking hunters in raids, because more then one hunter in a 10 man, the rest will leave the raid because of the shared loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point, you've missed it. <br />
<br />
Hunters wont be the only class to bring those buffs. Missing that 8% spell damage? Bring an unholy DK or boomkin if hunters are the bane of your existence. The point is to make these buffs even more available, this HELPS people, especially casual or 10-man guilds. And its only ONE BUFF AT A TIME. I doubt a raid leader, especially of a guild with a solid roster is going to go &quot;Oh, we're missing buffhere! I could either recruit or bring a hunter for that slot or I could bring someone of that class/spec. Ahh, I'll just bring a hunter because who cares if this means I'm missing that other spec/class anyway - its a hunter!&quot; <br />
<br />
Besides, check WoL and other parses - hunters are rarely at the top of the DPS charts (that's reserved for Fire mages and Fury warriors and skilled feral druids who get chain fed Power Infusion/Tricks/Hysteria). For a &quot;pure&quot; class, hunters are actually behind several classes for over all damage. We've been a utility class as opposed to a &quot;pure&quot; dps class for a while now. We're swiss army knives and you're trying to exaggerate us into sub-orbital laser canons.</div></div><hr />

I'm not completely satisfied with the Focus system, as early on it seemed to break the smoothness of a DPS rotation/priority system. However, they may have tweaked it so that it's less choppy and there's less time spent Steady-Shotting to regain enough Focus to fire off a special. I didn't enjoy being what equated to a ranged Feral Druid. I will however miss my Devilsaur Thud becoming astronomically large with Monstrous Bite and Bloodlust, even after they reduced the size increase on MB.

LOL. Fellow hunters please ignore this. Blizzard have stated pets will not benefit from player buffs in cataclysm. So the pets bring the buffs. This will go live. Shaman QQ, to be honest I have seen more Mage QQ to the corehound getting heroism, than shamans. <br />
Blizzard KNOW that hunters need some more buffs that are not easily cancelled by another buff. So this is an overall good change for them.</div></div><hr />

Too many people are still in WotLK mentality and it shows.

It sure looks like it, what with the mortal strike debuff... that would only really be useful in PvP or against mobs/bosses that heal themselves (suppose there's a lot of trash that does, but raid bosses?). It has the +crit, but that can be gotten from wolves as well (though I'm not sure what their second ability is, or if they have one).<br />
<br />
I'm just a little paranoid as my devilsaur Goldblum has been a constant companion for my hunter throughout WOTLK (meaning I stayed BM even when raiding... the guild didn't want me to put away &quot;their&quot; mascot :)) and I'm worried that Devilsaurs will end up subpar for PvE compared to other pets.

Since when pure classes couldn't have more than one raid buff? Pure classes can only fill one role which is DPS. It seems there even isn't &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;hybrid&quot; tax when DKs, palas and warriors are topping meters with their smournes. Now shush and heal my ass!<br />
<br />
Theres a difference between one class getting lust/hero to one spec (and it's one pet) and one getting it as base ability.

<br />
Bear in mind that all the really useful buff beasts are Beast Mastery only (heroism, mend, BoM, BoK etc). Now, I haven't been fortunate enough to get a Beta key, so I don't know how BM spec is performing (and of course even then it is liable to change). But consider this. For players with even a modest ability, BM is currently by far the worst hunter raiding spec for WotLK. It seriously handicaps your DPS. In present Live Server conditions, it just isn't an option. Chances are that it will continue to be the &quot;intro&quot; spec and not deal top damage. So there you are in your 10/25 man raid, yes, you are buffing the raid, but your DPS is poo. Hunters are rapidly going to get the Huntard name again. I could understand it if we had 3 specs now, but is it really going to be strong enough to remove Survival from the dual spec?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact is, only Beast Mastery Hunters are getting the most useful or OP pet buffs. For MM or Survival. the pet buff they are getting aren't that great at all. <br />
<br />
So if you are a hunter, you have to make a choice if you want to go BM and get your own bloodlust for raiding. Also, take note that BM spec was a failed spec in ICC raiding. So unless BM turns out to be a competitive spec, I wouldn't say that they are OP. Personally, the way things are right now for hunters, MM is still the best raiding spec for Cata.<br />
<br />
BM Hunters getting their own BL isn't worth QQ'ing. They are just gonna get a better chance of joining a raid. Just like how shamans are right now in ICC, they can give BL, but can never be on the top of the DPS chart.</div></div><hr />

Not by a long shot. Even as BM, if we have a choice, we will probably still go with a Devilsaur if we don't need to provide lust, if the current game is any indication.<br />
<br />
I have a few things to say about this.<br />
Like I said before, Bloodlust is a class-defining ability. It is one of the very few abilities of the Shaman that are currently still unique. In fact, almost all of our totems are overwritten by other skills from other classes; in some cases, this causes Bloodlust to be the only unique thing we bring to a raid! Because of this fact, I'm certain that if Blizzard continues with giving their unique abilities to other classes, they will become an obsolete class. And I don't want to have to reroll to a class I don't like, just so I can actually play the game!<br />
Let me give an example. If a raid group were to pick an evenly geared Shaman or Mage for a raid, who would they pick? Naturally, they would pick the Mage; Not only do they have their unique raid-wide buff, they also deal more damage then Shamans with equal gear level! As for PvP, the same applies - Shamans have very few ways of getting away, while Mages have many. Now, let's include the Hunter on this list: While I believe that they have about the same damage output as Shamans in equal gear, in PvP they have a lot more survivability due to their talents and playstyle, which still makes them preferred over a Shaman in that aspect!<br />
<br />
<br />
Make the stand all you want, it's not your game and if you don't like it simple solution for ya: QUIT!<br />
Should hunters have made the &quot;stand&quot; when you totem dropping freaks were given ghost wolves? <br />
<br />
I for one welcome the change, no longer does my raid have to carry bad shamans just for BL, or find a retarded priest for fort. Now we can pick and choose.<br />
<br />
The same applies for you, Archer. And no, Hunters don't have to make a stand about Ghost Wolves. Why? Only Enhancement spec gets them, they only last for a number of seconds, they aren't controllable by the player itself, and they have a long cooldown! Does your pet have all that? I don't think so. Ghost Wolves are of no competition to Hunter pets at all.<br />
As for quitting, I still like this game. That is why I pay money for it. Yet for that money I also expect to get something in return, instead of my preferred class being made obsolete by stupid and unneccesary changes like this! And like I said before, I do not want to reroll to a class I don't like just so I can actually play the game.<br />
With all due respect, making that comment practically showed how unexperienced you are with playing a Shaman. Believe me when I say this; In our current state of affairs, Bloodlust is a neccesary spell for Shamans. Giving it to other, more powerful classes without getting anything new and unique in return it just going to ruin the class... I'd easily compare it to removing Hunter pets from the game, It would just make them worthless!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I say again, if the only thing that makes the Shaman stand out is a spell that, for some fights, is required in order to even clear the fight, then there's a really big problem here.<br />
<br />
A class should be able to feel unique, but they shouldn't feel like they should get special treatment because of that one thing that only they can bring, and that's really how the Shaman class is now. If I'm vying for a spot against a Shaman, why should they take me when the Shaman has a buff that is required for some fights to succeed? No matter how much DPS I do over the Shaman, I would be cut for him, because his buff benefits every single raid member. It's completely unfair, and something that's been said since Wrath beta with the advent of &quot;bring the player, not the class.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not fair to other players that the Shaman would always edge out on them not due to skill, but due to utility. It's a completely terrible design.<br />
<br />
To go on your example, let's also put up the example that the Shaman is a good player that has a cool attitude and disposition and pulls out really good numbers, while the pure DPS Mage has a very lousy attitude and complains about every single detail from other players while assuming that they cannot make any mistakes at all, but also pulls good numbers. In this example, I would honestly pick the Shaman.<br />
On the flipside, let's say that my raid group consists of 24 really great DPS, but we have to have a Shaman who refuses to play by the rules, continuously AFKs, and his only real benefit to the raid is the unleashing of lust after much hassling. In this current raid environment, the raid leader will either try and find another Shaman to replace him, or just deal with him with the logic that he's bringing a buff that is needed for the encounter at hand. In the Cataclysm environment, the Shaman in my example can no longer act like that and not expect a real punishment in the form of not being able to raid half-heartedly.<br />
<br />
Of course, these examples are two extremes. There are going to be cases where a Mage and a Shaman, both with good attitudes and good gear, will be vying for a spot in a raid and one of them will be cut. It's just how things work, and it'll be a tough decision for a lot of people, too.<br />
<br />
Look, I understand your plea. I get that you think it'll create a problem in the natural balance of the game. But trust me when I say that, in all intents and purposes, it's good for the game. Blizzard, I would hope, is not doing this change to harm Shamans, but to help the raid groups on a whole. And because of the lost must-have-in-raid utility, it creates a drive to them to make sure that Shamans stay competitive in both healing and DPS. Trust me, if you really do love the class, then you can remain that class. If you're a strong player and your attitude is sound for your raid leader, then you will get your spot. It creates a drive of excellence to know that you must perform to your class's best to be given that raid spot. It makes you appreciate that class more.</div></div><hr />

It's easier than fishing and currently rewards pretty much nothing, is way too slow to level and is plagued with bugs. Which is fine since it's only recently added and will be changed loads before release.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a few things to say about this.<br />
Like I said before, Bloodlust is a class-defining ability. It is one of the very few abilities of the Shaman that are currently still unique. In fact, almost all of our totems are overwritten by other skills from other classes; in some cases, this causes Bloodlust to be the only unique thing we bring to a raid! Because of this fact, I'm certain that if Blizzard continues with giving their unique abilities to other classes, they will become an obsolete class. And I don't want to have to reroll to a class I don't like, just so I can actually play the game!<br />
Let me give an example. If a raid group were to pick an evenly geared Shaman or Mage for a raid, who would they pick? Naturally, they would pick the Mage; Not only do they have their unique raid-wide buff, they also deal more damage then Shamans with equal gear level! As for PvP, the same applies - Shamans have very few ways of getting away, while Mages have many. Now, let's include the Hunter on this list: While I believe that they have about the same damage output as Shamans in equal gear, in PvP they have a lot more survivability due to their talents and playstyle, which still makes them preferred over a Shaman in that aspect!<br />
<br />
<br />
There are no class-defining &quot;raid buffs&quot; anymore.<br />
Not even mages will have a unique buff anymore, you can be certain another class will have it. (And scrolls will have it too.)<br />
<br />
All classes are meant to be obsolete, as in you'll still be able to raid properly if class X doesn't show up. X can be any of the 10 classes, why the hell do you think shamans should be different?<br />
<br />
As for pvp, seriously? There isn't even any 83+ gear available, but you sir know exactly how classes will be at level 85 pvp don't you? CLASS BALANCING HASN'T EVEN STARTED YET.</div></div><hr />

By far the most stupid thing Blizzard has done to date. They are really trying to kill this game off. They gave it to yet another class that has a ton of utility already. This could have been seen coming though since they gave it out to mages though, further diluting this game into the abyss of homogenization-hell.<br />

Honestly, these changes have gone too far. When is this dumbing down, watering down, homogenization process going to come to an end? It's like Blizzard is actually TRYING to kill off their game with their sheer laziness now.<br />

This can be blamed on all the people who cheered Blizzard on each time they copy and pasted item models, abilities, and effects. Only people who don't see this as a bad thing are hunters, those who are going to make a hunter their main now, and the mobs of people that still say Blizzard can do no wrong.<br />
<br />
Seriously. Make classes feel unique from each other again. Make there be a reason you chose said class, and stuck with it. Not diluting it into basically, &quot;Tank, DPS, Healer&quot; classes. These are some really telling moves to the game.</div></div><hr />

I like the changes, their pretty cool; as well it makes choosing a pet for raids much better, huntards would look at you in a raid if you had any other pet than a wolf on my server v.v<br />
Plus the ghoul changes are sooo epiicccc!</div></div><hr />

Personally I think people like you are what's wrong with this game.<br />
How can you honestly say a buff, one stupid long cooldown button, is what defines your class?<br />
<br />
Buffs are there to give you the feeling being in a group/raid makes you more powerful, let class uniqueness be based on rotations, lore and graphics rather than one fucking button.</div></div><hr />

Why do people believe that making it so a group that can't find a certain class, but are still able to get a silly buff means they are secretly trying to destroy your class?<br />
<br />
Why do you insist that your class should be defined by a single move? Don't you think that hurts the game more than helps it? When I think Hunters, I think ranged physical DPS with pets. When I think Mages, I think of the classic magic user archetypes. When I think Warriors, I think of shield-bearers or axe-welders. And when I think of Shaman, I think of a totem user of 3 types: a healer, a caster, and a melee attacker.<br />
<br />
I do not think of Hunters as &quot;the class with the 10% AP aura&quot; or a Mage as &quot;the class with the Int buff and the spell crit increase&quot;. I don't think of Warriors as &quot;the class with an easy ability to destroy armor for my physical DPS.&quot; And I don't think of Shaman as &quot;that class with Bloodlust.&quot;<br />
<br />
The further we go from that mindset, the better. <br />
<br />
Yes, classes should feel unique, but they shouldn't feel entitled to special treatment. You shouldn't be playing a class just because of Bloodlust or because of an AP bonus or because of a spell crit increase. You should be playing it because you enjoy it. You enjoy the rotations, or you enjoy the mechanics, or you just enjoy the idea of being that class. <br />
<br />
You don't need to be a special snowflake. The only way you can in the Cataclysm game is if you truly excel in your class and spec, which should be a much better idea to go for, IMO.</div></div><hr />

Yea, Maybe the old-school hunters will get a new aspect of the game to them. While the nub huntards who make hunters look like tards. Will quit cause using the pet will be &quot;to hard&quot;....<br />
<br />
God if we can get that lucky....(I hate the pants-on-head-tards that infested this game with there syndrome when LK release.<br />

Falcio is right here Kiro, What your looking at as &quot;destruction&quot; to the game play. Is actually a much needed and wanted re-re-change to the game. In vanilla raid leaders could have a decent comp of everything due to 40 man raids. Now we have at max a 25man. So at one point. In big guilds you have to decide what class's make the cut and others don't. Your looking for the best raid comp you can get. So you want the 5% crit from a druid aura for your melee. While a 5% spell crit from the boom-chickens. With changes like this to hunters pet. It gives a utility even more utility, While saying. This shaman does less dmg as a whole than a hunter, So the hunter brings his BL/Hero pet and helps the group as a whole. I'm sure there is more to it. But that is the basic idea behind it.<br />

You're a fool.<br />
<br />
Anium is so correct here, Shamans were considered OP once. And there still considered OP in their own right. BL might be in a hand basket for classes who would otherwise not have it. But shamans don't have a internal cd on windfurry anymore. Which was the reason shamans were OP in vanilla, Due to the fact you could make 6 hits in one swing in PVP. (autoattack, windfurry 1-2, windfurry 1-2, autoattack). Frost shock just yelled NO RUNSIES!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arisette</div><div class="date">2010-09-15, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at this from the PvP side of things, Hunters are already known for retarded fast damage. Add in Camo and the ability to grab almost any buff/debuff they need for their team and this could get quite OP quite quickly. Although from a PvE standpoint it is a pretty nice welcome change.<br />
<br />
We have to be out of combat to switch pets, Camo won't work on the new pet brought it, and you can still &quot;see&quot; us in camo, but you can't target us. A quick AoE will break us out of it. And it only lasts a minute with a... 2 min cooldown? Can't remember. <br />
<br />
Another thing to remember is that pet abilities that did damage before aren't doing so now. Additionally, in order to get the Heroism/Bloodlust buff, hunters have to be Beast Mastery... and Big Red Hunter-Pet no longer makes us immune to CC for 10 seconds. It'll break CC, though, giving us some use there. So we can't Big-Red ourselves, Hero/Blood, and pop out of Camo (the extra damage from this ability was also taken away) and take out an entire group. We're still killable, folks- I play an Ele Shaman hardcore in pvp and Heroism does not always save my butt- it's a nice boon, really, but nothing that'll break pvp.<br />

Absolutely terrible change with giving out Bloodlust and basically the ability to hand out any buff at will via hunter pets. By far the most stupid thing Blizzard has done to date. They are really trying to kill this game off. They gave it to yet another class that has a ton of utility already. This could have been seen coming though since they gave it out to mages though, further diluting this game into the abyss of homogenization-hell.<br />

<br />
Seriously. Make classes feel unique from each other again. Make there be a reason you chose said class, and stuck with it. Not diluting it into basically, &quot;Tank, DPS, Healer&quot; classes. These are some really telling moves to the game.<br />
<br />
Dang, I'm sorry, I forgot to bring my tote-... wait, I don't have totems. I have... True Shot Aura!... oh, DKs have it too. Hm... I'm.. ranged physical damage!... <br />
<br />
What about the hunter says &quot;I'm a perfect class that can do everything&quot;? Last I checked, we were considered a &quot;pure dps class&quot;... that is, we ONLY DPS. We are versatile for solo play, but then again, what class isn't versatile? Druids can do four different roles in a raid, shaman can do three, paladins can do three, priests can do two, as well as DKs and warriors. We need to be giving boons to pure dps classes, otherwise you'd see a general lack of these pure dps classes showing up in your raids because people want that DPSer that can also switch to a healer role. THAT'S versatility. There's no encounter in ICC or any of the Wrath raids that say &quot;We NEED a hunter;&quot; you hear raids needing Heroism for that extra burst for encounters like Blood Queen, or druids for battle rez.. but no one has said &quot;We need a hunter to complete this raid.&quot; <br />
<br />
With these new hunter pet boons, we're no longer going to be penalized for being a pure dps class by bringing certain raid buffs to raids that otherwise would not have them, therefore making our class more marketable to raid. Why would a hunter want to bring a pet that can do Heroism/Bloodlust if there's already a shaman or a mage? We can bring other utility pets to fill in other missing raid elements. If anything, it's giving us versatility where we had none of it previously. <br />
<br />
Buffs do not create an entire class. Their mechanics do- hunters play differently from any other class and that works between all the other classes entirely. I would not feel like a shaman if I am a hunter (who has to be a certain spec, mind you, in order to get the Heroism-ability pet, unlike shaman who just.. get it) with a corehound pet. Heroism/Bloodlust does not a shaman or a mage make.</div></div><hr />
