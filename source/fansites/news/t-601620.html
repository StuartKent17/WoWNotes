Unless of course they by (GC Demo) mean &quot;Game Convention Demo&quot;, thing is if that's considered a demo or a playable demo :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gore</div><div class="date">2007-07-31, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Outland has Shattrath as a &quot;capital&quot; city, with a presence of the playable races due to those left behind after the closing of the portal. Northrend wouldn't reasonably have a large &quot;friendly&quot; city (especially without people there getting across the world somehow to other cities), so the goblin city in Undermine would be the new &quot;capital&quot; in the expansion. <br />
<br />
thats what i see most likely, not sure if anyone else saw the maps on the behind the scenes dvd but it had undermine and northrend all mapped out like they were definitely planning them for the future<br />

I don't really get the first paragraph of your post.<br />
However, for the second part, this supposedly false rumor is pretty legit. It's pretty much the same as finding patents for not yet announced products, actually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
@Ama, I don't think there's any cause to lose respect for this site or Boubouille because he tries to quash fake leaks, then allows/confirms real information when it gets posted.<br />
<br />
We're all slavering over the news. We want to know, and we're going to speculate, and dig, and feverishly latch onto anything we feel is reputable/reasonable/believable enough to satisfy us. It's unavoidable that it will end up on this site as on others, but at least he's deleting the stuff that's just pointless waste of time.<br />
<br />
Cheers to Boub!</div></div><hr />

I don't really get the first paragraph of your post.<br />
The first paragraph is meant to discredit the finding of the rating, stating that the misinformation about SC2 vs SC MMO means this German source could be as off as the Russian one was... it leads right into the second paragraph, looking down on Boub for posting &quot;yet another false rumour&quot; with &quot;misinformed&quot; source info.</div></div><hr />

What exactly you're not getting? What some german rating site webmaster in urgent need to put a name for a project took the name from MMO-Champion, just to fill the void? Ofc, I understand, Blizzard won't tell _us_ the name of their new expansion, few days before Blizzcon, but sure they'll tell this to some ratings site, hoping we won't find out? Don't be silly, please.</div></div><hr />

Also, the first world scourge invasion could have been used as the testing ground for a future Xpac....esp with the favorable response it received from the community.

They sure as hell do! What do you think the deadline for submitting materials for review is? They could restrict any convention content which wasn't reviewed and deemed appropriate (basically... gotta watch out for swastikas).<br />
<br />
<br />
Last time I checked, Germany is in Europe, while Blizzcon in America. Further more, ESRB ratings only provide information ABOUT content, and if it's not fitting, they just give another rating for this game. Besides, even if Blizzard feels that they need ESRB to give their rating for something halfway from us, it doesn't mean they [Blizzard] have to disclose real project name. Oh, and show me ESRB opinion on this.</div></div><hr />

First of all: The USK, tests all Media (I know it for sure for movies/software/all kind of TV Stuff, not sure about music and print-media but I think they test that too) on being &quot;bad&quot; for kids. It's some kind of goverment-office, so I think the information is damn sure true.<br />
<br />
Since the Games Convention is an Event like the old E3 (kk a lil smaller, but still biggest in Europe I think), they also had to test Blizzards WoW-GC Demo, I mean u can t show a Splatter game on such an event (yes i know it's a silly comparison;) )</div></div><hr />

There's conventions in Europe too you know.<br />

Theres a gaming convention in Germany in a month that Blizzard is going to. They likely needed to give that information so that they could show the game at the convention and had to give it to them by a set deadline.</div></div><hr />

yeah, thats why I said &quot;the old E3&quot;. I think Wikipedia refers to the E3 as it is now. It s about 1/4 or less then the old Area and, i am not sure about this, only for reporters and special guests, not for everyone who can buy a ticket.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless: Its a really big event and since youth-protection was quite a (media-pushed) field in Germany for the last years, I am 100% confident, that the USK tests all playable Demos on the GC. <br />
Remembering the fact that Blizzcon Guests can play something in WoW with their or premade chars, its quite logical to also get a Demo on the GC. And I don t think they will just invent that name if its only the next patch with Zul Aman and Co what's playable</div></div><hr />

Eine Feature-Liste gibt es freilich noch nicht, aber zumindest wissen wir nun auch schon, dass es auf der Games Convention 2007 (23. - 26. August) eine spielbare Version von Wrath of the Lich King geben wird. Anders ist der Beiname &quot;GC-Demo&quot; nicht zu erklären. Der Sturm auf den Blizzard-Stand kann somit beginnen.<br />
<br />
Die absolute Spannung ist jetzt drei Tage vor Beginn der BlizzCon noch nicht raus, fehlen uns doch noch Informationen über die Inhalte des zweiten Expansion. Hero Classes? Level 80? Wir halten euch selbstverständlich auf dem Laufenden. <br />
<br />
[Update]:<br />
Laut dem MMO-Champion behauptet eine Quelle zu wissen, dass die Klasse des Death Knight in 'Wrath of the Lich King' Einzug halten wird. Der Wahrheitsgehalt dieser Info lässt sich derzeit nicht überprüfen, aber sie könnte die von IGN genannten Gerüchte bezüglich Heldenklassen bekräftigen (siehe heutige News), da der 'Death Knight' ein Untoter Held aus WarCraft III ist.<br />
Auch dürfen wir jetzt umso mehr gespannt sein, für welches Spiel die für die BlizzCon angekündigten Beta-Keys sein werden. <br />
<br />
Germans love MMO-Champion?</div></div><hr />

And im realy getting tired of farming honor points in the same 4 battlegrounds :'(. So I hope some new pvp elements will be added.</div></div><hr />

i guess mmo-champion has lots of german-speaking readers... i´m from austria and as many of my guildmates from austria, germany &amp; switzerland we mostly rely on international wow-sites, mainly cause the websites available in german are crowded with thousands of tiny little kids... no vial information available there...</div></div><hr />

Personal moment of glory was to kill a 69 frost mage with my 64 frost mage<br />
Personal moment of humiliation: When the same mage camped me for 20 min with a shaman a warrior and a warlock cause he was pissed cause he sucked...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they hinted that Blizzard forgot to do so.</div></div><hr />
