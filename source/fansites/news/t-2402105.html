Go do argus. Get the 910 badge gear. That will help a lot. Run some LFR too. Should be able to get up to 920 or so in a week or two. And make sure your legendaries are 1000.</div></div><hr />

I did both of those without the preferred legendaries or anything close. I mostly learned how to play the spec doing the challenge as well. Gear level was 925ish and 66 or 69 traits. Nothing special. You can do it! I believe in you!</div></div><hr />

considering i had an ilvl of 914 when they came out (mythic NH geared with old paragon trait capped) 885 is far too low to meet the dps checks even if you include the new traits etc.</div></div><hr />

Doable maybe. But speaking from experience, the Guardian challenge is far too frustrating without at least one of the 2 recommended legendaries. The level of RNG bullshit and commitment required is far beyond what most players would be willing to put up with</div></div><hr />

I did the monk dps (I know easy) and monk healing at 891 when they came out and I haven't done more than 5-6 heroic bossed all expansion.<br />

<br />
WW monk one was the easiest by far to do, many classes and specs can't mathematically handle the mechanics with lower quality gear, a good example is the arcane mage version, it's just not possible to do enough dmg to the shield when you need to break it before he gets the cast off if you are sub 900 ilvl.</div></div><hr />

You can do the aff lock without the ring. How to cheese:<br />
<br />
1) Talent build (https://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#CZql). Absolute Corruption, Mortal Coil, and Grimoire: Supremacy are mandatory; rest are strongly recommended.<br />
<br />
2) Summon your infernal and stand next to Karam. Do not cast anything just yet! When he says &quot;I obey&quot;, activate Unending Resolve and let Karam hit you while you're spamming your infernal's basic attack button. You'll get knocked back while your tank picks up the aggro. Wait a couple seconds before going whole hog on Karam to be sure the aggro sticks. This portion doesn't need to be rushed, so give yourself some time to build up on souls.<br />
<br />
3) When Karam is at around 33% health, he'll go into Purgatory. However, you can interrupt this cast with Mortal Coil (you need to be quick). When I did it, it gave me approximately another 30 seconds to work with. Be sure to renew Agony on Karam so that his health will continue to decrease while you focus on Raest.<br />
<br />
4) Karam will go into Purgatory before Mortal Coil is back up and become untargetable (although Corruption won't fall off). Continue to focus Raest.<br />
<br />
5) When Karam comes back out of Purgatory, he'll have lower health (as expected). But since we're cheesing this, it'll be even lower. Renew your DoTs so he'll return quickly to Purgatory and go back to dealing with Raest. It's at this point you should use your Drums of Fury to burst Raest the rest of the way down.<br />
<br />
I never needed to switch out my infernal for the doomguard, though YMMV.</div></div><hr />

I've done all the challenges across all classes, all specs.<br />
Only my main had all legendaries. The challenges are less frustrating with the right legendaries, but in no shape or form gated and impossible.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest bashing your head against them until you get it right, rather than giving up due to not having X leggos. You might end up regretting your decision!</div></div><hr />

If it helps, here's the guide that I used. Its fairly short but the advice is really good. I didn't use the luffa's even though I had them (I got the balance shoulders and cape), but that guide is written for someone who has no legendaries or tier.<br />
<br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbQ9PcAmd2c<br />
<br />
Balance affinity is as important as bear tartare to eat. Velen does more damage as melee then as range, so the guide starts with pulling the boss closer.<br />
<br />
Naturally dif people came up with dif methods most likely but hope this helps. GL and take care &lt;3</div></div><hr />

Day 1 of mage tower done by arcane mage at 898.<br />
<br />
Also now we have 75 traits (rather than &lt;40) and NLC.<br />
<br />
885 was probably too low, but at least 895 or 900 tops to account for all the challenges.<br />
<br />
Really top players had 900+ item levels on release of MT, and since its not repeatable no reason to try and go lower just for run. The floor is a lot lower than people think.</div></div><hr />

I appreciate the advice, but I already beat the challenge. I was fortunate enough to have luffas as my 1st legendary And even with it I found it a fairly frustrating experience. Eyes spawning behind me usually meant a guaranteed wipe. Bad timing on add summons or two infernals going into phase 2 would mean the same. I can't imagine how much of a pain the challenge is with neither of the recommended legendaries, given how hard it is with only 1.<br />
<br />
Ironically, after 26 attempts at the challenge I ran out of bear tartare food and managed to win the fight without a food buff on the 27th attempt</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jastall</div><div class="date">2018-06-06, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the mage tower really isn't as daunting as most people think. Only 2 of them have anything even near required legendaries (Aff and Guardian) and even then there are ways to mitigate that. Skill and some perseverance is all you need, one can easily get an alt to 915+ in short order. Basically as soon as you have 2 leggys, any of them, you can do the challenge fairly easily, apart from the tank and healer ones which are trickier.</div></div><hr />

That's not even close to the case. You can one phase the affliction warlock one and I did the guardian druid with Soul and the frenzied regen boots, you just gotta manage your stacks right and hyperfocus when you get to kruul</div></div><hr />

i did the guardian on at 920 with NO legendaries. had really bad rng. how did i do it you ask? moonfire p1 boss until she died only going in to interrupt (getting in a swipe and a thrash on the way) and focus down the portal adds asap. kite the infernal and that was it she died easily before the third infernal spawn. p2 is the same as any other tank although i had 1 more infernal but thats no big deal. if you think you need luffa or any other lego to do that boss your just bad at the class.</div></div><hr />

It did involve the major points of tanking though: positioning, picking up adds, positioning, awareness, rotating cooldowns, positioning. As a solo challenge, it's sort of hard for it to not be a bit of a DPS race, honestly. And yeah, I am very glad that I will never again be knocked into the nether by an infernal (or an eye beam). Finally getting to Kruul on a new spec...get knocked off about five seconds in...shit...<br />

Especially since they gave the Paladin version about double the health to get through (because balance?). <br />

<br />
1) Talent build (https://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#CZql). Absolute Corruption, Mortal Coil, and Grimoire: Supremacy are mandatory; rest are strongly recommended.<br />
<br />
2) Summon your infernal and stand next to Karam. Do not cast anything just yet! When he says &quot;I obey&quot;, activate Unending Resolve and let Karam hit you while you're spamming your infernal's basic attack button. You'll get knocked back while your tank picks up the aggro. Wait a couple seconds before going whole hog on Karam to be sure the aggro sticks. This portion doesn't need to be rushed, so give yourself some time to build up on souls.<br />
<br />
3) When Karam is at around 33% health, he'll go into Purgatory. However, you can interrupt this cast with Mortal Coil (you need to be quick). When I did it, it gave me approximately another 30 seconds to work with. Be sure to renew Agony on Karam so that his health will continue to decrease while you focus on Raest.<br />
<br />
4) Karam will go into Purgatory before Mortal Coil is back up and become untargetable (although Corruption won't fall off). Continue to focus Raest.<br />
<br />
5) When Karam comes back out of Purgatory, he'll have lower health (as expected). But since we're cheesing this, it'll be even lower. Renew your DoTs so he'll return quickly to Purgatory and go back to dealing with Raest. It's at this point you should use your Drums of Fury to burst Raest the rest of the way down.<br />
<br />
I never needed to switch out my infernal for the doomguard, though YMMV.<br />
<br />
He was dead before the second purgatory came up for me (920ish). If you can go ham at about 40% then you'll have loads of dots that will just tick down and kill him. I think I used Contagion for this instead of AC and loaded up a bunch of UAs for it. He died while he was following me around then it was just a matter of nuking the adds and focusing Raest. Either way, it's made significantly easier with Mortal Coil :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's horseshit though. Look at the God Queen challenge. It's not at all a dps race (though dps obviously helps and there is the shield-bust necessity), it's purely about doing mechanics intelligently and not losing your head.<br />
<br />
Blizz could very easily have given us a halfways intelligent dps drone to do the damage while we held aggro and survived and did positioning type stuff, instead they made us fully responsible for our own healing and damage output on top of everything else.<br />
<br />
I've got it done on three classes (Warrior, Druid, and DH) so far, so I'm not crying from a position of failing at it, but these are by far most challenging of all the challenges I've done. The dps ones are stupid cake by comparison. I cannot judge the healers.</div></div><hr />

i did them without the legendaries. if you get enough gear you won't need them. for affliction you should tank the first guy with pet and nuke him. then burn the boss with drums. if you don't have enough dps to kill the boss right away use your drums for when the first guy gets up again and burn him asap. the boss should be low enough by then to kill him after.<br />
<br />
bear challenge is just a matter of playing well. also you can hit the boss from outside his aoe without luffas or the other one. if you get enough gear you can kill the first guy really quick so that it doesn't even matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 930 all challenges are trivial except Fury warrior which is a pain, Affliction unless you have ring or cheese it, Sub rogue if you aren't a multitasking god and most tank challenges (although there's a blood dk at 950+ that zergs bosses down without at least 1 infernal lmao). <br />
<br />
If you are 930+ and don't at least understand the fight or your spec by now with all the world buffs (for Agatha), flasks, augment runes, 72+ in your weapon you might not deserve it. Gl trying tho <br />

Did affliction lock with just Prydaz and the army of the light quest ring. If you time your mortal coil on the tank boss so it hits him just as he's going immune you can skip an entire phase, it makes it much easier. Just have your infernal tank him so you don't get your ass beat (Let him hit you at the start of the fight and have your infernal on defensive).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, with that change you also can ensure that the Command Center is up when you do the Agatha Challenge, which adds on top to the Argus buffs (Lightblood elixir, for example), and Falcosaur Omelette food. You can also use at least one of the Druid farm plot buffs from the OH.<br />
<br />
With Command Center and other buffs, you kann melt her even with specs you never played before, with any legendaries. Just like I did on my feral druid with 970 legendaries (talent ring + crafted boots), about 905 item level, 4th golden trait unlocked, but not many concordance, and some mediocre stat stick trinkets. I literally set up my action bars before I went into challenge, and I was more learning to play the spec and the proper use of CDs then anything else. She was down after less than a dozen of tries. :D<br />
<br />
With current gear available, where you can get 920+ item level with casual play, Agatha is a joke with all buffs.<br />

I did the guardian one just fine with only sephuz, just learn the fight<br />
<br />
I also could down Guardian without Luffa or Eko. I had tank boots and talent ring. If you lack on DPS or survivability, just overgear the challenge and learn the mechanics. It also helps to start in Moonkin form (with Moonkin affinity, ofc), and DPS the inquisitor until you have to interrupt the first time.<br />
<br />
Heirloom DPS trinkets from WoD also help a lot in the tank challenge, because demons. :D<br />

<br />
I did the guardian one with thrash pants and bubble necklace at 922 ilvl. Didn’t find it that hard, was in fact a lot of fun, 5 stacks of thrash running and staying in the aura burning the boss made the first phase very fast. A couple weeks ago I was at my friends house and he was trying the guardian trial, he had luffa and the chest and ilvl of near 940. Gave it a couple try, that first phase lasted way too long staying outside, made the fight boring and in its own way overly complicated.<br />

What I did, was turn off all the fucking bigwigs alarms, and only put on the ones I actually wanted to be warned about. Life drain is a must, as is twisted reflection.

I saw concern about Guardian druid and I did dread it after trying it during broken shore, but I did it in five tries without any of the recommended legendaries.

Oh well. Hopefully they're still going away in the pre-patch and if this &quot;constant uptime&quot; isn't more than 2-3 weeks it's not the biggest of deals I guess.<br />

Do the treasure chest WQ every time it's up. Takes a minute and most of that is flying to broken shore. Takes like 20 minutes to roll through all your characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Put infernal standing on Karam. You stand far away, just inside max range of Mortal coil. Target Karam. Just before the &quot;I... obey&quot; blow your infernal's meteor smash cooldown, then SPAMSPAMSPAM your infernal's attack button.<br />
<br />
You'll get streaks where he won't hit and karam will still fixate on you just jump off the edge and reset.<br />
<br />
But when it works, he's locked on your infernal forever no matter what you do. Stay at <br />
<br />
Your next hurdle is properly using Mortal Coil to break his Purgatory. You set up a macro that targets Karam and casts Mortal Coil. The instant you hear Raest yell &quot;Useless!&quot; you slam that macro. the travel time on the spell means it will hit after he goes untargetable but before he completes his cast, and will lock him out shifting to the intermission.<br />
<br />
Most of the difficulty, if you can call it that, relates to just accepting that these things are going to bug frequently and you may spend 15-20 attempts if you have an unlucky streak but the one time it all works you'll laugh your way to a kill.<br />

When they boosted the bosses health that tactic isnt that viable any more. Its good for a solid start but the infernals aggo is complete shit and when you burn the guy down to go into the next phase you will pull off the pet.

<br />
If anything it is doing it with the ring that is the cheese method. Glitching the way through first purgatory helps, but you still need moderately decent dps for it afterwards. With the ring the damage requirement is much lower and you can essentially roll your face on your keyboard in order to complete it that way. Though I suppose the Infernal tank part of the glitch makes that even easier. Which, given the fact that outside of the ring - with the second most viable method being a literal bug - Aff does not have proper tools to deal with the encounter sans overgearing it, makes the design rather crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I missed a lot of those windows too. The time pressure was one of the reasons this was hard in the first place. But again, considering the limited time left it's not such a big deal. People still need the gear and enough shards and everything else that is time-gated to get it done.<br />

I already had the major skins from the tower I was shooting for but am glad for the extra time to work on my pally.<br />
<br />
I would've loved to relax some and focus on getting the skins during some weeks of constant up-time too, but I actually wanted the skins so instead of being a self-entitled whiny pleb who thinks that &quot;challenge&quot; items are everyones right to get instead of something you have to work for, I went out and actually got them.<br />
<br />
To clarify I'm not really that upset that people get a few weeks of constant up-time since gear and shards will still be limited, I'm miffed at Blizzard for caving to the entitled plebs who gets what they want through whining rather than just doing what is needed. If this would've been something planned, which it clearly isn't, it would've been completely different.<br />

You stand near him when he spawns and knocks you away with his shield the first thing he does, meanwhils you spam taunt with your infernal. It works most of the time if done correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A way that I found much more consistent than what Heladys said is to stand together with your Infernal on top of him at the start. He will knock you away and then switch to Infernal instantly. If you are lucky he will glitch twice and not only focus on the Infernal but also gain no stacks during the fight so you will not need to even heal your Infernal. As for the knockback at start, you may need to cast Unending Resolve at the start if your max health is on the lower side. Otherwise you may die in one hit.</div></div><hr />

giving it for free would be making challenge weapon skin automatically unlocked. They are doing this to help the fact that there isn't as much people turning in resources to rebuild it fast enough. And also to give 0 excuse to people not to do it.</div></div><hr />

Why are they giving away a cosmetic skin (that you still have to actually complete the challenge to even get) for free? They aren't, those people are still actively paying their subs during the most boring period in the expansion. I have no idea where people get this 'free' from. We're all customers, sadly some customers like to feel high and mighty because people are getting access to their 'special skin'.<br />
<br />
And yes, I too did most of the challenges I cared about before outgearing it, but I don't feel like I have some kind of weird ownership over my 'special skins' or that people are getting spoon fed just because they don't have to wait X amount of days before attempting the challenge again.</div></div><hr />

I don’t mind removing the arbitrary time restriction; but I do wish they’d scale everyone to 910 ilvl or below for it to remain the challenge it was originally intended to be<br />

Why? We could do these challenges for months with an item level of up to 960 or whatever. There are only some weeks left until the challenge is removed, and the change is not even live yet.<br />
<br />
I have done all of them months ago. I did 9 more on alts (mostly mage, also 2 paladin except the healer one). And if the challenge goes live and I will not be occupied with the prepatch event, then I surely will run some more, just because they are fun to me.<br />

They should set max ilvl to 850 and remove the skins from everyone that got them above that.<br />

where did i say that? stop twisting what is written and taking it out of context for your own agenda, furthermore i'm not even convinced they should be ilvl capped because they are an expansion feature not just a patch feature, ergo they were intended for people to out gear, and even with the extreme gear increases some people just can't complete these challenges because they lack the mechanical skill to get them done, which was said when they were released that 'while they were possible at the time that most people would need ToS gear, and those that still couldn't manage it would likely not get it with antorus gear'.</div></div><hr />

And there's been plenty of mage towers active during weekends for people who can only play during weekends to do the challenges they want.<br />
<br />
yup - those lazy filthy scum who dare to have jobs , families , and other grown up obligatons in life :) <br />
<br />

Lol @ the people claiming you can't do some of the challenges without proper legendaries. You can beat any of the challenges with 0 legendaries if you're at least 915ish. I only have five specs left to do (fire/arcane, demo/destro, and hpriest). All others I completed at 915-930 ilvl and usually with just the Argus kill legendary ring since most classes I don't even play and just wanted the appearances before they're gone. Hate to sound like a douche, but this truly is an appropriate time for the ol saying &quot;git gud&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
i dont doubt that if mage tower was full time open instead having retarded limits people wouldnt mind doin it at 915 itlv - problem is time - most people dont have enough time to put 100-200 attempts in each skin. they want to be done in 20-30 max (and its more then possible in around 940-950 itlv)</div></div><hr />

They should set max ilvl to 850 and remove the skins from everyone that got them above that.<br />
I'm sure justandulas would like that because he got them at 800 ilvl becuase he is a pro.<br />
<br />
No items, final destination, 1 life rules imo</div></div><hr />

Well yeah, no shit.<br />
<br />
Nobody's saying otherwise, the right legendaries definitely make things easier. What people are countering are the &quot;if you don't have X legendary it is impossible&quot; nonsense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has long been &quot;free&quot;. Most of the challenges became a joke with end ToS gear, atm many of the mechanics can be ignored. Did it on my prot paladin alt before taking a break from Legion, apparently one of the harder (if not the hardest) MT scenario. Opening up the availability for MT doesn't make the scenarios any easier.<br />
<br />
If you want to complain about free prestige, complain that the MT challenges doesn't scale iLv. That is the only way to make it challenging.</div></div><hr />

Life drain is a must, as is twisted reflection. Don't need alarm for anything else imo. Still, I managed to eat every single Twisted Reflection, and still made the boss, thanks to a lot of orbs lying around.<br />
For the tank challenges I turned off all add-ons because there's so much happening that I found them distracting. I took my headphones off and just reacted to what I saw visually, made it way easier for me.</div></div><hr />

I have to do the Guardian Druid one, I have a 936 item level, did you find it easy on Druid?</div></div><hr />

I found it easier than the other tanks, but it was the second last one I did, so I already knew the challenge at that point. I didn't have luffa, but moonfire spam still works fine outside the aura.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't have luffa's as well. Moonfire spam is very strong, and 936 is more then enough. I wiped a lot cause druid was my first tank challenge. After a while, you just go autopilot on more and more mechanics cause you know them so well. <br />
I didn't bother going into the aura that much, only for drain life and them pump out some damage till a few stacks only</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a few different forums and Reddit things that had a lot of people arguing that it should have been capped to ilvl 910 and no legendaries while also calling noobs for doing it at a higher ilvl. Also affl lock challenge without cheesing it is literally impossible without being the best affl lock in the world. Doable with 890 ilvl if you glitch the boss with both exploits</div></div><hr />
