Island Expeditions for Week of August 21<br />
The islands expeditions for the week are Verdant Wilds, Whispering Reef and Rotting Mire!<br />

Call to Arms: Stormsong Valley<br />
This week's Call to Arms is Call to Arms: Stormsong Valley (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/52782-call-to-arms-stormsong-valley) or Call to Arms: Stormsong Valley (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/52957-call-to-arms-stormsong-valley). Head to Stormsong Valley with warmode enabled to kill 10 players of the opposing faction and loot an air supply. This will reward you with 250 honor and 75 reputation for either 7th Legion (https://www.wowdb.com/factions/2159-7th-legion) or The Honorbound (https://www.wowdb.com/factions/2157-the-honorbound).<br />
<br />
<br />
No Artifact Knowledge Yet<br />
Much like in Legion, the amount of artifact power needed for your Heart of Azeroth (https://www.wowdb.com/items/158075-heart-of-azeroth) will begin to decrease week by week. This has not started yet, however, and can be expected soon in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP Brawl - Gravity Lapse<br />
Defy the law of gravity in this week’s PvP Brawl: Gravity Lapse! <br />
<br />
Every other week, a new PvP Brawl will be available to players looking for something just a little different. Each Brawl will offer a variety of modes, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay, and you’ll find them in the Group Finder tool (hotkey “I”) in the Player vs. Player tab. Just like Random Battlegrounds, you’ll receive a reward for achieving victory. Here are just a few of the Brawls you can look forward to:<br />

<br />
Gravity getting you down? Step into the Eye of the Storm and be prepared for a whole new en-lighten-ing experience. Every minute, players on the battlefield will find themselves launched into the air, only to gently fall toward the ground again in a perpetual aerial ballet as they try to accrue enough resources to take the win home for their team.<br />

Honorbound Pigsticker weap dmg?<br />
This weapon some specs get from todays Emissary on EU Horde is bugged or something. The weapon damage and dps is like half that of a normal 340. <br />
340 Blightreaper 162.5 dps<br />
345 Honorbound Pigsticker 82.1 dps<br />
Both agility.<br />
I can confirm that it is something that is under investigation at the moment. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17622492893?page=1#20))<br />

Auction House Lag<br />
We are aware that some realms are seeing issues with slowness when using the Auction House and are currently investigating making some changes to help alleviate these issues. We’ll update as soon as we have more information to share.

It was in 2017. Nothing has changed, though they assured they are working on fix. What makes players think developers will move their lazy arses this time?</div></div><hr />

No need to limit players. Simply require UI confirmation for every posted auction. Also require manual input of bid and buyout prices when creating auctions. <br />
<br />
That will break bot-like add-ons, preventing players from canceling and re-listing auctions without any input from player and will break people posting thousands of single stacks. People using default UI will not be affected, people using bot-like add-ons for automated posting will be screwed.<br />
<br />
If developers could break WQGF and similar add-ons so easily, what's stopping them from breaking add-ons that lag the hell out of auction house?</div></div><hr />
