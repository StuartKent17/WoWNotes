Receiving it 6 days and facing bosses 1 day later than EU for such a small patch, this is all we have. We already tried our best.<br />
<br />
World 2nd is world 2nd no matter what, we won't spend a lot of words on it. Instead, we just want to have our two cents here for Blizzard:<br />
<br />
We totally understand why different regions get the patch on different days, which is absolutely worthy if most players can have better game experiences with less bugs. However, Blizzard please do make the hard mode really HARD so players from all regions have a chance to fight. By hard we mean challenging unknown rather than farming killed. Distinguishing top guilds by their farming capacity is just NOT the right way to go. In addition, we would really appreciate if you could bring PTR to Taiwan.<br />
<br />
Everything we got belongs to all wow players who can speak Chinese (&quot;ni hao&quot; is enough :p), no matter you are on the server of China, Taiwan, EU or US. Thank you very much for your supports! Thank Blizzard for making such a great game and Soft-World International for bringing it to Taiwan. Hope wowers on the China server can enjoy WoTLK soon.<br />
<br />
Note: Don't worry, we only have 2 soulstones.<br />
<br />
We are the Stars!<br />

MMO-Champ Talent Calculator Updated<br />
The Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/) has been updated with a few extra features to make it ... well, less lame. Feel free to report any bugs, suggestions, or complain for no reason in comments. <br />
<br />
Shorter URLs<br />
The URLs have been shortened drastically, people shouldn't hate you as much as before when you post one on forums. <br />
<br />
Old - http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight=23050205300033032310231013500000000000000000000000000000023023033100301000000 00000000000&amp;glyph=100825060504&amp;version=10192<br />
New - http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight#_CJEBpX09Xxw45,dQJOe3,10192<br />
<br />
Developers Note - It didn't seem like a good idea to keep the URL compression secret, if you want to get a look at the code download mmoc-talent-v2-encoder-decoder.zip (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/mmoc-talent-v2-encoder-decoder.zip) and check the Readme to understand how it works. <br />
<br />
Build Selection<br />
You can now select the version of the game from the menu at the bottom right of the screen, Live and current PTR versions are clearly labeled to make your life even easier. <br />
<br />
Import and Export<br />
You can now Import and Export talent calculators from/to the WoWArmory, the old MMO-Champion URL, and even Wowhead for those of you who want to leave us. However keep in mind that we cannot detect the version of the build you will import from non MMO-Champion calculators.<br />

<br />
Because personally; deep inside at this point they know they would've gotten 1st had all servers started at the same time. Now I don't condone being bitter about a win/lost, but as of now Stars is a group of players that feel they can compete with the best, &amp; having a few disadvantage(s) to still be second! Nuff said: If I was on a voting poll Stars be getting my #1 vote 8)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well to be fair, the US is not known for it's gaming :P I live in the states and I'm American. Although we have many talented players/guilds, I do believe overall there are better players/guilds in Europe/Asia. At least when it comes to gaming :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Europe only has a delay of a handful of hours, Stars has quite a bit more, the more hours delay the harder it is to make up, to a point where it becomes nigh-impossible unless we're talking about bosses where even the best guilds wipe on for at least a week; on top of that as said before they don't actually have PTR access, while in these cases it wouldn't have mattered to much as HM's weren't tested, for example Ulduar they got it a full week later AND no PTR; the PTR for EU/US on Ulduar was very extensive to the point where most top guilds probably 1/2-shotted the bosses.<br />
The best Stars has is reading our english reports on the fight, which is probably quite bothersome and often inaccurate.<br />
<br />
But still, even if you count away a full day (not sure about the exact hours) the fact remains that Stars did it with 12 attempts remaining and no soul stone abuse, that's a damn nice feat which calls for more praise than Paragon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That... or like Orden said, the many world firsts from US prove that a delay of 1 day matter a lot ;)<br />
Anyway, Stars did something incredible, gratz to them.</div></div><hr />

the problem is that guilds from regions that get the content later can read up (leaked) information about strats from guilds that got the content earlier and killed the ecounter / cleared the content.<br />

the only fair way is to unlock all the encounters world wide at the very same time<br />
<br />
<br />
EU and US get the PTR to practice on i cant recall the last boss to be released that wasnt fully tacticed and documented out. it would certainly be a lot fairer than current setup.</div></div><hr />

Considering that they have been gimped by no PTR's and 24 hours delay , i think i can say that these guys just smashed every high end top guild both in EU and US .<br />

Maybe they had a warlock parked outside the instance? Not sure if that would work though, get 15 of your guild alts that are warlocks (doesn't even have to be max level) in the raid group just outside the instance to give soul stones between attempts.<br />

you can stun the adds so that they don't burrow<br />

a nicely timed concussion blow,warstomp,insert generic stunning effect will cancel out their cast</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of this, I am quite aware. It was much easier to just ignore them in P3 though and let them burrow so you can burn Anub faster as it's a pain in the ass to heal and the add tank gets his ass stomped almost as bad as the MT. I'm just not sure if that works really well in 25 man since we could kill him before the 1st set of adds came back up. An OT tanking 8 adds during P3 would be painful if you were a hair slow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mirrorzoom</div><div class="date">2009-09-09, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what i posted on the US R&amp;D forum about how many raiders Stars have. <br />
<br />
==============<br />
<br />
First of all Stars doesn't allow alts, so you are only allowed one character in guild. There are 322 members right now in Stars but a lot of them are not very geared for top end raiding.<br />
<br />
The fact is Stars have 4x25man raids total. But only Raid 1 and Raid 2 can be considered hardcore raiders.<br />
<br />
In fact, raid 4 disbanded shortly after 3.1 came out due to lack of players. They were reforming raid 4 just last week, which did not kill yogg 25 normal last week due to new players. Here's their Raid 4 recruitment thread:<br />
<br />
http://www.stars-guild.com/showtopic-1396.aspx<br />
<br />
Raid 3 are the usual 3 day raiders. They mostly raid 3-4 hours per raiding night and are not comparable to other top guilds in term of progression. This following applicant was accepted by Raid 3. (last reply) You can click on his armory to check his gear, not really geared for top end raiding. At the time of application, his hardmode experience were limited to 10man also, with full clear 25man Ulduar and 2/5 25man ToC normal.<br />
<br />
http://www.stars-guild.com/showtopic-1283.aspx<br />
<br />
Now Stars raid 1 and 2 are hardcore raiders. For this week, I have heard sources say that they ran ToGC with raid 2 first, which killed twins with 20 some attempts left. I guess raid 1 just observed their strat and ran later in the week. That's also why they used their 50 attempts so late. Again, there's no alts in Stars, so raid 1 and raid 2 are different players. But watching that 20 or so attempts definitely will help raid 1 achieving their Anub kill.<br />
<br />
So, Stars doesn't have 300 elite players to fill their roster. But they didn't just go in ToGC with 25 people who never experienced Anub hard and killed it in 38 attempts either. (Taiwan servers doesn't get PTR) If you must define them, they are about 2 hardcore guilds who share info and strat, and bunch of casual players who enjoy the guild tag and atmosphere.<br />
<br />
============<br />
<br />
As for the no alt rule, here's the quote from their guild regulation:<br />
<br />
Q u o t e:<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
From today, Stars applicants and members can only have a Main ID in guild, it will be the ID registered on DKP system.<br />
<br />
Changing main ID need to reapply like usual.<br />
<br />
Other than guild banks, no members are allowed to have alts in guild.<br />
<br />
Alts can join the alt guild for communications.</div></div><hr />

Well, PTRs are open to every US/EU players only.<br />
Technically, you could be a player of both US/TW server ;D Just to get access to PTR<br />

TW server doesn't have PTR. And, usually, some bug-fixes applied on US/EU will not properly apply on TW.<br />

I get that you wanna complain and talk to blizzard outside of blizzard's reach, but if you read it more carefully you would notice they are simply putting a DR on the stun and didn't say anything about the damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
someone explain to me why people cry about Soulstones<br />
<br />
<br />
This is just speculation from me as I left my warlock at 70, but I think a warlock outside of the raid could SS someone in it, so in theory everyone in the raid could have a soulstone during the attempt by getting 25 warlocks to soulstone them before they do it. I might be wrong here as I said... it's been a while since I played my lock and it might not be possible to do that.</div></div><hr />

We aren't going to see another Anub'arak kill for awhile probably. The whole encounter pretty much resolves around these 4 cute adds that spawn and paladin stacking wins here.<br />
<br />
The paladins pretty much take - http://www.wowhead.com/?item=43867 and have 4-5 paladins on a rotation spamming holy wrath this means, the adds are actually never hitting the tank much (if at all)<br />

There is no bug.<br />
<br />
It's about getting everyone SSed before starting an encounter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is well known that Stars have at least four raid groups. Raid group B is essentially the backup and training raid for the top flight Raid group A. Essentially, the main raid group went through a practice session with Raid group B's characters before using the tries on their main characters. <br />
<br />
Look at NGA's report on Stars' progress(http://wow.178.com/200909/45956198228.html), they wiped 19 times on Northern Beasts, wiped twice on Lord Jaraxxus, and four times on Faction Champions. Then info on the Twin kill is noticeably absent . <br />
<br />
Now take a look at the visible roster for that vaunted first Northern Beasts kill(after 19 tries), it's completely different from the Anub'arak H kill roster. <br />
<br />
My very educated guess is that their A team took a minimum of 88 tries(50 tries using team B's characters and 38 tries using team A's characters), before coming up with the Paladin cheese to complete the Trial of the Grand Crusader instance.<br />
<br />
Yah right....... keep advertising that 12 tries remaining..</div></div><hr />

It is not need to discuss how many raid groups they have, and dont forget, they did not attend PTR to test any BOSS.<br />
<br />
If Ensidia has many groups, I think they would also use the way which Stars choose.</div></div><hr />

Lets more Qqqqqqqqqqq and more qqqqqqq <br />
Srs these ppl , go try to kill boss with even 3 groups if needed then come bk and try to qq , when u see how hard it is ....<br />
As they said they got delay as EU over USA but still that kill can be count as world 1st, but can count as world second. <br />
Tho i think that is great to have such competition , As we saw Star going to be very active in Heroics / Hard modes races , so IF u don`t know how to play game , or u are in one big EMO guild that think they are world 1st * without that achievement * then better get that kill before them or else don`t wine on forums :)<br />

Actually, Stars is great,<br />
But the facts can't be changed that China Guild always share several accounts for signle players.<br />
<br />
Normally, Raid-A farm their raid, so did Raid-B.<br />
For new challenge, Raid-B players are forced (Actually, most Chinese are willing to do so) to stop their playing, give the authority to player-A and try n times.<br />
<br />
This is never cheat.<br />
<br />
But I don't think EN/US guilds lik Ensidia would try ToC in such innovative method.</div></div><hr />

This annoys me though: <br />
<br />
<br />
We totally understand why different regions get the patch on different days, which is absolutely worthy if most players can have better game experiences with less bugs. However, Blizzard please do make the hard mode really HARD so players from all regions have a chance to fight. By hard we mean challenging unknown rather than farming killed. Distinguishing top guilds by their farming capacity is just NOT the right way to go. In addition, we would really appreciate if you could bring PTR to Taiwan.<br />
<br />
I think blizzard have got it right - making content that only 0.01% gets to see is stupid. With hardmodes it gives the best guild something else to aim for and it's doesn't leave me feeling short changed. If you want to fight the unknown, don't read tactics or go on the PTR!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macktrol</div><div class="date">2009-09-09, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is so funny to see all those noobs pointing at the way Paragon or Stars killed A'nub.<br />
Soulstones (Paragon) or multiple accounts (Stars) even if this could be true, why dont you<br />
go and try the same stuff and see how far you will get? clearly it is not that easy, clearly<br />
if you want to be number one you have to be prepared to do whatever it is needed to reach <br />
that goal. <br />
<br />
I think most people pointing out on this 2 ways to get there are mostly Ensidia fanboys wich<br />
makes me LOL cause Ensidia is so sure they are number one but guess what they clearly arent.<br />
<br />
Lets also not forget that Ensidia gets paid to play and even so they cant kill A'nub, maybe<br />
Paragon should handout their soulstones to Ensidia or Stars their accounts and Ensidia should<br />
give them their paycheck and we will see how far they can get!</div></div><hr />

I don't want to start a political debate here. But the official name of Taiwan is &quot;Republic of China&quot;. While china usually refers to &quot;People's Republic of China&quot;. Read the history about chinese civil war between 1946-1949 if you are interested.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But honestly what is the point of &quot;world firsts&quot; on this instance when after one week we have two guilds clearing it all, 87 guilds at 4/5 heroic and 339 at 3/5 - and how much more it would be without 50 tries limit?<br />
<br />
Only thing that really matters in ToC are tribute achievements.<br />
<br />
P.S. I am not saying it is bad, I welcome balanced difficulty and 50 tries limit. I just think &quot;first drama&quot; should move from &quot;we did it at 9AM!&quot; to &quot;we did it in less attempts, l2p!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Wow in china is not limited, AFAIK there isn't WOW in china at all<br />
they got a new wow operator in china, and it takes time to bribe around and pay the right people<br />

Absolutely nothing stops any guild to do the same provided that they have time to invest in same way of raiding. This is far from an argument for anything.<br />

However both kills depended on chaining Holy Wrath stuns which was not intended and has been hotfixed. The fight will now be a lot harder. So quite frankly one should probably consider the fixed anub to be a new world first challenge, significantly harder than the first. There is ofc also the world first 0 wipe clear to compete for as well. Not to take anything away from Paragon or Stars, they clearly beat everyone else so far. But the race is still on imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is, people might look at this as the only option they have for beating Anub, and Blizzard don't want people to bring 5 paladins to the raid just because of one boss (although it is one of the toughest so far).<br />
<br />
Raid composition should be completely random, and yet should they be able to kill the boss, as long as they have the skills and the gear (and of course the proper talents for their respective role). Blizzard didn't intend using Holy Wrath as THE way of killing the boss, and therefore preventing people from thinking so.<br />

<br />
Do you guys honestly believe other top guilds didn't go into ToGC on other alts/acc's to learn about the fight first? <br />
<br />
Did you guys honestly believe with the amount of hours those so called US/EU TOP GUILDS raid in ToGC it took them the ENTIRE WEEK to use 50 attempts? With the amount of time they spend in ToGC those attempts won't last for more than a night or two, let alone AN ENTIRE WEEK.<br />
<br />
OBVIOUSLY they practiced on the fight through other means. Whether it's 10m, second raid team, or alts. <br />
<br />
The fact remains, top guilds all have used or tried to use more than 50 attempts in a week. Hell, some guilds even server transferred to release raid locks. <br />
<br />
Get real guys.<br />
<br />
Grats STARS<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Blizzard only nerfed HW because they lost on their bet that no guilds would be able to clear ToGC on the first week. It's not an exploit when people use what is availiable to them as a class to make the fight easier. I GUESS IT'S AN EXPLOIT WHEN YOU SHOCKWAVE THE ADDS RIGHT? It's obvious Blizzard wants everyone to farm ToC and ToGC for the next few months until everyone is geared in full 245/258 before someone can finish Anub again by having the gear/dps to kill Burrowers AND Anub without the entire raid dying to the massive raid damage + Burrowers stacking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The raid will spend a few hours discussing initial strat. Maybe a few more hours tweaking strat in between total. But there is no such thing is waiting hours in between tries. Top guilds have players who are pretty much top-notch experience-wise, gear-wise (all that's availiable to them so far), and skill-wise. They all know how to play their class. They all know how to follow a set of strategies. They all know how to execute a plan. The difficult part is simply to have an attempt where all the stars (no pun intended) align so the encounter can be downed. This means no d/c, no accidental deaths, and no mistakes. The only way to achieve that is by attempting over and over again. Spending hours and hours attempting the same boss over and over again. They're not going to spend hours discussing how much dumb mistakes people made in the last attempt because they're all capable players who rarely make raid-wiping mistakes. <br />
<br />
Do you honestly think &quot;top guilds&quot; ration their attempts by nights? &quot;MM GUYZ WE HAVE 50 ATTEMPTS, WE RAID 6 NIGHTS A WEEK SO WE'RE GONNA ONLY DO 8 ATTEMPTS TONIGHT OKAY?&quot; They find alternative ways to practice those fights and make sure they STILL HAVE TIME to use those 50 attempts on their main raid to try and achieve a kill. You're insane if you think they'll use their precious attempts by going in an encounter blind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey guys we just wasted an attempt to find our there's a limited amount of frost spheres.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh hey guys we just wasted an attempt to find out burrowers can 1-shot people and spawn twice as many&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh hey guys we just wasted an attempt to find out burrows can spawn in p3 as well&quot;<br />
<br />
You better believe they're quick in their attempts once they've established a working strategy. You think the race to WORLD FIRST is not a rush? Get real.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But what am I even saying, I think a majority of people on these forums consider stars to be the best in the world, and i tend to agree with them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
my main concern is that if those 7-11k dps numbers per dps is whats *required* to defeat this encounter. Seems pretty unreal.<br />
<br />
Then again, when Lich king first came out I never featured I'd be doing 5-6k dps myself and I do that on a regular basis now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ss09</div><div class="date">2009-09-09, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PS: Blizzard only nerfed HW because they lost on their bet that no guilds would be able to clear ToGC on the first week.<br />
More likely they realized what a mistake it was for players to be able to keep Undead mobs stunned indefinitely. It's clear they knew the importance of not being able to stunlock mobs because they already had diminishing returns on other stuns. I see no gameplay reason why it should be allowed to keep Undead mobs stunlocked but not any other type of mob. Saying they changed Holy Wrath out of spite seems pretty emotional. Blizz should have taken care of this before, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not an exploit when people use what is availiable to them as a class to make the fight easier.<br />
True, so I doubt these guilds will get banned or have achievements taken away.<br />
<br />
<br />
I GUESS IT'S AN EXPLOIT WHEN YOU SHOCKWAVE THE ADDS RIGHT?<br />
You can't stunlock mobs with Shockwave; it has DR on it. If you could and it was intended, either Blizzard would design encounters where you'd have to bring 5 Prot Warriors, or no adds would be stunnable.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's obvious Blizzard wants everyone to farm ToC and ToGC for the next few months until everyone is geared in full 245/258 before someone can finish Anub again by having the gear/dps to kill Burrowers AND Anub without the entire raid dying to the massive raid damage + Burrowers stacking.<br />
Not sure if this is sarcasm or not, but requiring full 245 for a hard mode isn't unreasonable. I'm sure people will come up with other methods to down Anub'arak without full 245 though.<br />
<br />
But I agree with the rest of the post; I think it's interesting to see what lengths players will go to and what mechanics they use (like 25 soulstones) to get world firsts.<br />
<br />
The true hard mode, A Tribute to Insanity (25) is still up for grabs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
================<br />
<br />
So bliz invite us to do it again.<br />
<br />
I think it's necessary to hotfix holy wrath, otherwise it's pretty disappointing that an end boss only takes 30 some attempts.<br />
<br />
I'm more hoping for a yogg 0 light type of boss, which took us 500+ attempts. But anub doesn't look the part right now.<br />
<br />
Thanks blizzard, we can play a little more.<br />

You guys crying that stars is the best guild in the world need to step back here and look at what STARS really is. Stars is not a guild, they are a SERVER. There guild STARS has 300 mains.<br />
<br />
300 active MAINS. Without peoples alts they have enough people to form twelve 25 mans raids. TWELVE RAIDS. You think they don't? You think they just walked into Anub not already knowing the strat they were going to use? Here how about this.<br />

<br />
<br />
Notice a difference here? My count is 8? Eight people were in the yogg zero that were in the Anub. Maybe I'm off and it's a total of 10 either way no other guild. NONE. ZERO. Not Premo, Ensandia. Nobody has that many alts because Stars is just a fucking server of people.<br />
<br />
If they have a strat that involves 22 hunters, a shaman and two rogues with thunder fury. THEY GOT THAT SHIT.<br />
<br />
If they have a strat that requires 17 Mages, all female gnome, 4 dwarf priests and one of each tank class with there Tier Four on. THEY GOT THAT SHIT.<br />
<br />
If they have a strat that requires 4 ToC geared rogues, 5 geared Paladins and rotate an AE STUN on the adds negating half the fight. THEY GOT... oh wait.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They had 14 attempts left the day BEFORE the next week of raiding? Sorry no. They didn't slowly take 6 hours between attempts. They had another raid going through and getting the strats down for them so they can bring in the alts or hell the other mains and clean up. <br />
<br />
<br />
They literally. Zerg content. I don't ever want this group of people to be catered too in World of Warcraft.<br />

Grats to stars, IMO you are the #1 guild.<br />

You killed it a day late, but you got the patch 6 days after everybody else. On top of this, you had more attempts remaining within the same reset. This, IMO, proves that you did it more effectively than all other guilds.</div></div><hr />

US worlds first?<br />
Have US taken a single WF since pre vanilla Nax?<br />

On a serious note though, clearly this whole patch is a big failure with everything being cleared on the first week.<br />
And before someone says, show us your achievement for blablabla. No I haven´t cleared all content, basicly stoped playing 3 months ago because of bordedom with WoW but I still very much like the lore and read the books.

If this is true then i must say they have a pretty insane management dealing with so many raiders. For those who have ever try to manage a guild as an officer, Class-leader or guild leader you should know better that this is a HELL of a job and im talking about 40 people only not 300. So if Stars deals with 300 people then i must say they are really pro!<br />
<br />
Stars = 300 spartans and pretty good ones too.<br />

<br />
Stars is a guild who play on Taiwan servers, not on the main-land. Though some of their members are from the main -land. Most of them use proxy-sever to get acceptable speed of connecting to tainwan servers. Their support-company( some hardware companies as far as i know) pay for the cash of proxy-severs and most game fees.<br />
<br />
Stars is not quite a example of chinese guilds. Most chines guilds get their ass kicked due to the FIREWALL beijing GoV put between Tainwan and mainland. I know a lot of guilds only go raid after 0100AM to just get yellow pinged.<br />
<br />
Due ot some brainless ppl in the GoV(mostly in Beijing), WotLK still NOT passed to main-land. But Chinese Guilds still have some fun like playing SW with less than 20player+4Alts ,such as this.<br />
<br />
BTW: some personal feeling<br />
What Stars said in their Letter in the News is lying. They got payed for playing. We not. GG<br />
The harder the encounters will be , the more pride and pirce will need to be offer. Thats what guilds like Stars is seeking. World first kill proves nothing to players like me in some far far away pve server. The Stars are trying to make some boss that either join a big guild like them or impossible to beat SO they got more human resources.I think Stars should spend more money and time to seek sleep with some top hot model chicks than giving stroke themselves.No kidding!<br />
<br />
Chinese players still love this game, and they view this site a lot. thx.</div></div><hr />

I was wondering about that, since it seemed strange that given the crackdown by the PRC government on online gaming, people could apparently easily just connect to a server in Taiwan/RoC and play. Not to mention the political status between the two.. (erh.. dare I say countries? ;) ), though I realise that relations are improving bit by bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no buff the boss is getting here, and the tank only has 1 impale on hitting for no more than 4k, but the first boss can still 1 shot any tank we bring. Tanks with 50k+ hp still die because the fight has random shit you cant combat with skill.<br />
<br />
Its bullshit to make all the healers spam ENDLESSLY waiting for this to happen, and when it does, its an instant kill. One time i even got swiftmend for 13k in while he was geting this 0.3 sec nuke, and he still died. <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I did not &quot;speak for most chinese ppl&quot;. Just sending my own thoughts. what i said is based on what i saw: how most chinese play and how the chinese guilds played the game. Broke 99 guilds to form a star guild to raid is not so funny.<br />
<br />
I guess Game designers make money by selling as much as copies to &quot;poor guy&quot; like me(maybe sounds like someone selling drugs in backstreets?), not sell BMWs or Boeing 747s to million dollar baby.(even Boeing 747 is full of poor guys most of time ,wait, better than full of al-Qaidas, right?)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game desinger are easily misguided by some so-called pro-gamers. In fact simple and clear game make game sell good. But hard game and 1000APM make pro-gamers earn more and look cooler. Its hard to balance those two.<br />
<br />
As someone said china got kicked by japan?. Dont want to make too many words here as i know US/Eur ppl have little history knowledge. I am quite sure china is fighting japan alone from AD1937 until some japanese monkey got the chance,time and recourse throw little bombs at Pearl Harbor on y1941/m12/d07. And i am sad to see some elitest guy in their time got to pull-out in north-korean and Vietnam. And I am so sorry to see the elitest troops in the world now get sick in IRAQ and Afghanistan. I may think it is some ppl's tradition to &quot;care no one until others throw fires to them&quot;. Better care a liittle more, baby.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW<br />
I do not support those wars in north-korean and Vietnam and they are mistake chinese gov made, but in that time people think differently cuz they not login wow-sites to post.<br />
Most chinese ppl, yeah here i am sure, support US war in in IRAQ and Afghanistan! Cuz someone is taking care of bombers.Even chinese Gov like these two war, they could spend resource to made more Firewalls !<br />

<br />
If this is true then i must say they have a pretty insane management dealing with so many raiders. For those who have ever try to manage a guild as an officer, Class-leader or guild leader you should know better that this is a HELL of a job and im talking about 40 people only not 300. So if Stars deals with 300 people then i must say they are really pro!<br />
<br />
Stars = 300 spartans and pretty good ones too.<br />
<br />
ps: Ofc this is all nothing but speculations from some frustrated fool but if it is true he just gave me 1 more reason to belive Stars owns the place.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, 300 is minor numbers for Chinese guild.<br />
For most players from China who form guild in Taiwan Server, <br />
the more general number is 500~800 players, <br />
Many of these guild also setup 2nd guild for ease management.<br />
<br />
So you could call Stars being so innovative at any cost.<br />
Since the gold-farmers and title-seller are often seen in these guilds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">liupang</div><div class="date">2009-09-12, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">from my experience(was in that guild 3 years ago), Stars has about 100-150 active players, and around 50-80 of them are diehard raiders. Their system is to have 2 full raid groups that's world-class and about 10-15 players on each group's bench. <br />
<br />
And now that they migrate to Taiwan server, I think they lost some long-time members due to unwillingness to relocation. But then of course they can recruit new blood on Taiwan servers, so their size should be still about the same. They are a rather small guild in Chinese WOW standard. Most successful Chinese wow guild has way more members, I know some have 500+ active raiders. <br />
<br />
And no, those huge guilds won't be competing for world firsts, and most of them are not even PFU guild. It's just hard to maintain a really huge organization yet still keep a elitist approach. It just can't be done. Look at Microsoft, ever since they cross the size of 10,000 employees, they sux a lot. <br />
<br />
So, you can say Stars has a small advantage against other Euro/US top guilds since they are about double the size, but to say they have 300+ or 10 full raid group is just ridiculous. Actually, because the time slot required for raiding on Taiwan server(Servers are so crowded that any serious raid has to be done after midnight), lots of members are leaving , so they have to deal with a high turn over rate, which is a quite big disadvantage.</div></div><hr />

Just sending my own thoughts. what i said is based on what i saw: how most chinese play and how the chinese guilds played the game. Broke 99 guilds to form a star guild to raid is not so funny.<br />
<br />
I guess Game designers make money by selling as much as copies to &quot;poor guy&quot; like me(maybe sounds like someone selling drugs in backstreets?), not sell BMWs or Boeing 747s to million dollar baby.(even Boeing 747 is full of poor guys most of time ,wait, better than full of al-Qaidas, right?)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game desinger are easily misguided by some so-called pro-gamers. In fact simple and clear game make game sell good. But hard game and 1000APM make pro-gamers earn more and look cooler. Its hard to balance those two.<br />
<br />
As someone said china got kicked by japan?. Dont want to make too many words here as i know US/Eur ppl have little history knowledge. I am quite sure china is fighting japan alone from AD1937 until some japanese monkey got the chance,time and recourse throw little bombs at Pearl Harbor on y1941/m12/d07. And i am sad to see some elitest guy in their time got to pull-out in north-korean and Vietnam. And I am so sorry to see the elitest troops in the world now get sick in IRAQ and Afghanistan. I may think it is some ppl's tradition to &quot;care no one until others throw fires to them&quot;. Better care a liittle more, baby.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW<br />
I do not support those wars in north-korean and Vietnam and they are mistake chinese gov made, but in that time people think differently cuz they not login wow-sites to post.<br />
Most chinese ppl, yeah here i am sure, support US war in in IRAQ and Afghanistan! Cuz someone is taking care of bombers.Even chinese Gov like these two war, they could spend resource to made more Firewalls !<br />
&quot;a random unspellable ID&quot;------&quot;PS&quot; stands for my guild name from Diablo2 to WOW (http://www.pactofshadow.com/bbs/index.php) &quot;X‘ means X-rated LoL and &quot;hum&quot; is cut for humanity LOL. Perhaps Chinese player like me not hardcore enough for bliz games, at least not as some compensationAOE guy.<br />
<br />
to psxhum: If you're really a PS member, you should know, without permission, we don't speak in the name of guild. Yes, you've said it's your own opinion, but you've already taken the guild in.<br />
<br />
About the wars: No matter WWII or Korean War, it's not about the game. As I know, this forum, &quot;MMO-Champion&quot;, is a game forum. So, stop talk about those.<br />
<br />
to others: Yes, Stars got the 2nd kill. But that doesn't mean other Chinese players sucks. Even many US/Eur people knows that Chinese servers can't update in time. That's not the Chinese players' fault.</div></div><hr />
