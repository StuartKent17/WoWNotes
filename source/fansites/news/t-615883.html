While watching all the updates regarding mounts, drakes, proto-drakes, I noticed a few that were mentioned early on, but never re-mentioned when their names went from gem-oriented names (IE: Ruby Drake, Amber Drake, etc) to simple color based names (IE: Red Drake, Bronze Drake).<br />
<br />
Were the drakes, listed below, discontinued/scrapped, or are they still in the works for being implemented in the expansion?<br />
<br />
<br />
Emerald Drake: <br />

<br />
Wyrmrest Red<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/wotlk/boss_sandbox/wyrmrestvanquisher(vehicle-red).jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
Were they just place holders, nixed, or are still in there and just not mentioned?<br />
Thank you in advance!</div></div><hr />

Currently, the protodrakes are rewards for certain achievements, usually raiding or doing 5-mans, but one of them (purple I think) is a reward for doing all of the Holiday achievements. Some of the mammoths and bears are just purchasable from a vendor in Dalaran. Engineers can make the motorcycle, and it's BOE so everyone can use it. Tailors make the flying carpets, and they're BOP. The drakes so far have only been from raids. I'm sure the 'black war mammoths' are from PVP, similar to the rest of the 'black war' mounts that you can already buy.</div></div><hr />

They are seperated. You can do both of them if you have the luxury. Hence the difference in item levels between rewards from either quest. <br />

The proto drakes are pretty cool but I probably won't have the means to acquire the black one. I really like these drakes compared to TBC drakes. They are just a huge mash of purple and wings. Too big in my opinion. The new drakes actually look like the drakes from vanilla WoW(namely ebonroc)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sounds like you expect the 25man's to be a lot harder. The truth may actually be the opposite depending on how well the event tuning goes. 10-man should be easier to coordinate but may end up having even less room for error.</div></div><hr />

My question is (since I cannot find the source which would most likly answer this simple question)...<br />
<br />
These achievements, specifically the ones that reward these proto drakes are they server first's ? Like once someone on that server has Achieved that achievement is it gone for the rest of the people to try and get ? <br />
<br />
For example lets say there is an achievement to kill all the bosses in Naxx 25man on hard mode under say 2hrs (I haven't been on the ptr so I don't even know if its possible, its an example) the ppl in the raid make the achievement and gain there Proto drakes however, does this mean that the achievement is now gone? Like no one else on that server can try to achieve that achievement ever again ?</div></div><hr />
