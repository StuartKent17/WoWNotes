Warlords of Draenor - Garrison Stables<br />
One of the buildings you can put on a large plot in your garrison is the Stables (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/65-stables#related:buildings). The stables will show off mounts that you have set as favorite mounts, allowing them to wander around to different stacks of hay.<br />
<br />
There are five other buildings (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/65-stables#related:same-plot) that can go in large plots, with a total of two plots available at garrison level 3. As with every other building, there are three building tiers, which give these bonuses: <br />
<br />
<br />
Tier 1 - Enables the capture and training of special mounts on Draenor.<br />
Tier 2 - You may remain mounted while interacting with objects in outdoor Draenor zones.<br />
Tier 3 - Increases mount speed in Draenor by 20%.<br />
<br />

will work out... if we can really get mounts and train em or idk ^^</div></div><hr />

When the mainland is no longer the current area of focus, why would it matter then if we can interact on faster mounts? Instead of using facts to come to a conclusion (which cannot be made in this case, because there are still unknown variables. See: Developers can choose any fucking time if they want to add in flight or not), you're leading facts into your set conclusion.</div></div><hr />

I can see my dreams of fantastic Nagrand screenshots just burrow away...not fly, obviously... they nerfed mount speed by 20% by changing how speed buffs stack. This is giving it back by forcing is to upgrade this building to get back to the speed we have on live.</div></div><hr />

will work out... if we can really get mounts and train em or idk ^^<br />
Would seem odd to have mounts you can only ride if you have stables in your garrison, but they couldn't work like normal mounts, otherwise you could just have a stable on an alt, or even have one then demolish.</div></div><hr />

The new faces just look like they go from angry to very angry to angriest lol<br />
<br />
also some of the old faces had permanent stubble on their face, and some are obviously suppose to look older and have more wrinkles the new faces don't seem to have any of that making them look like they just have different expressions and not necessarily different face traits.</div></div><hr />

I think the issue here is that we're not seeing the actual animations. The old models were intended to be relatively static. Adding a sophisticated rig does present a lot of limitations, especially given the game's age. Once we see this living breathing face, I doubt many people will opt for the old model.</div></div><hr />

You are free to speak your mind, I am free to air my concerns, like it or not. It was not to create drama though, so you can stop making such claims before telling others what to do or not.<br />
<br />
I have a hard time seeing them allowing mounted actions while flying, but as a previous poster said, perhaps the speed is related to overall speed nerfs. And I can continue hoping.</div></div><hr />

They all still looks extremely similar to each other, in my opinion. It's not really that big of a deal though. Players wanted updated models, not a variety of facial options.</div></div><hr />

I chose the top face, far right (the one with small golden eyes and dark rings around his eyes) for my character for the extremely evil, dark rings around the eyes.<br />
The new version doesn't have those, and in my opinion loses all of the personality of the face.<br />
<br />
Now, I understand this is probably just a first pass, but I hope they'll revisit these soon to add in the unique darkness to some of those faces.</div></div><hr />

Technically hunters have like 10 including bloodlust/heroism. So hunters have more opportunity to come to a raid if it came down to choosing a player based on the buffs they provide.<br />

<br />
Shame Flames of X is going away, it was a small QoL button but I can live with it. The 20% mount speed isn't labeled as just ground or both ground and air, I doubt it'll make it to flying mounts so is it crazy to think they really might skip flying all together in Draenor? Personally, I don't think I'd mind it that much. I enjoy walking around on ground mounts and believe it does indeed increase immersion. WoW has so many beautiful zones, yet nowadays most you see of it are the tree tops.</div></div><hr />

I was worried I was going to have to pay to change to a better face, but they made my favourite face (Last row, mid-column) even better than I thought they were capable of.<br />

The other faces are pretty satisfactory too, but I'd agree with the others who stated some of the darker eyed faces in the top rows aren't as &quot;evil&quot; as they once were, although they certainly are menacing.</div></div><hr />

As I understood it that's making up for the mount speed bonus being removed from guild leveling. To think even for a second that it's intended to be some kind of shock absorber for 'no flying' is just excessive paranoia.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are the guild bonuses being removed? I thought it was only guild leveling to get the bonuses that was being removed. The guild movement bonuses at present are 10% mounted speed and 25% flight path speed so the 20% stable bonus doesn't appear to be a replacement. If all guild bonuses are being removed I will miss mass rez most of all.</div></div><hr />

Currently the guild mount speed bonus is still intact on top of this stable bonus.<br />

Yea and honestly the side by side someone earlier in the thread posted...doesn't look all that better. I dunno I guess I thought this was really going to kind of bring the models up to current gen graphics, and it falls pretty far flat. It's like barely an improvement.</div></div><hr />

? I don't even see how that is relevant since all the orcs pictured are bald, and 'hair color' is not tied to face anyways... <br />
<br />
I think the 'attributing' things like 'wiser' or 'funnier' look has some weight, but it also is quite clear the old faces were so 'low' res and static that you could draw your own conclusions of what they are meant to be(like face 6 in the pic, always has been an awkwardly, 'ambiguous' face to me). That's the problem with a lot of the older faces, they were ambiguous, to a maddening degree. <br />
