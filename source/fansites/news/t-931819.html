<br />
Why would you believe me more than someone else? Good thing. Well, this document is a pretty obvious fake anyway (especially with stuff like &quot;neglected Shadow Priest class&quot; in official documents) and Blizzard just doesn't draft that kind of stuff 3 months before the event before they send it to the entire company. <br />
<br />
Btw, internal documents would never say &quot;Activision Blizzard&quot;, unless they're scheduled for public release. The address isn't even Blizzard's, it's the Activision Blizzard HQ. You don't send that kind of mail to two companies 3 months before the Blizzcon just for fun.<br />
<br />
I mean, seriously guys, Blizzard isn't stupid when it comes to leaks, they don't just take the risk of doing that stuff so early.</div></div><hr />

Well. You have a point, BUT, the address is the Headquarter of Activision Blizzard which is still the main company. And I am pretty sure if you look at Blizzcon from a finance POV - 'Activision' have something to do with it.

Blizzard documents originating from an Activision-held office would be about like Chevy documents with a GM stamp. It's technically all the same company, but theyre branched the way they are for a reason. A notice like this would be more likely going *into* an activision office, not coming out of it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qbn</div><div class="date">2011-07-04, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...or we could be reminded that Blizzard leaks information. Do you all really think that this site is the only place to leak info? I really hope I get a chance to eat my words here, but I've got a question: When was the last time this site accepted word from anywhere other than Blizzard itself when it came to leaks? This is an issue of self-preservation. MMO-C is a curse product, it's got a vested interest in being first. It's like AP calling out Reuters for being wrong due to a typo, when Reuters was first to break the story. <br />
<br />
And really, you guys think that Blizzard doesn't see real USD in cheaters and exploiters? Publicly, they can afford to offer an unconfirmed slap on the wrist to cheating. Internally, though, how could they ignore such a massive contribution to their bottom line? It's not as though cheating in a video game is against the law. It's just against the eula/tos. Utopia for them is making us legits feel like hackers are being punished while allowing hackers to go ahead and pay that 15 USD. Just take a look at this recent Stars hoopla: they gladly gave that guild the kill, didn't ban them, and kept nearly 1kUSD. So why not leak to the fringe, the cheaters, they pay too.<br />
<br />
Oh,and Zergal, if you remember when DKs were imbalanced because of one ability, you didn't play early wrath. You were told about it. It was beyond imbalanced. It was beyond Killing Machine.<br />

<br />
Although i've left playing WoW for the forseeable future, I do tend to keep tabs on what happens with the game (in case it might spark my interest in returning at some point). Based on past announcements for expansion packs at Blizzcon, do we know for certain that an announcement is forthcoming in this years Blizzcon? It would seem to fit the pattern estabilished by past announcements, based on the announcing of Burning Crusade at Blizzcon 2005 (released in early Jan 2007), Wrath of the Lich King at Blizzcon 2007 (released in late 2008) and Cataclysm at Blizzcon 2009 (released in late 2010).<br />
<br />
Knowing this, it suggests that the next expansion should be announced at this years Blizzcon, with a possible release sometime in mid-late 2012. Are there any sources that might confirm this hypothesis as of yet, and are there any solid evidence behind what the next expansion might be?</div></div><hr />

Well, I'd say that every respectable site/gamer/newspaper who's been around for more than two months knows that the priority on whom to believe statements from is: Blizzard themselves &gt; Boubouille &gt; MMO-Champion visitors&gt; the rest.<br />
<br />
The only thing that made me smile when reading that fake was Naga as a playable race for Horde. I'm Horde until my dying breath, and the only things I've fervently wished for since Vanilla is a complete underwater zone (Vash'Jir has the misfortune of competing with Mt. Hyjal =/ ) and naga as playable race.<br />

Glad i wasn't the only person who thought of this, i feel better hah.<br />
<br />
Yeah i can't believe anyone would believe this, i just refuse to accept that blizzard is THAT stupid to:<br />
<br />
1.) Use another Shadow Naaru boss after all the hell they have been getting about recycling bosses / content. <br />
2.) Reuse the dranei &quot;hey guys we crashed here can we hang out with you and kill some orcs&quot; plot for the ethereals. <br />
3.) Make up a new boss and storyline when people complain about all the loose ends in the lore as it is. And when they still have a few great bosses they bring out as Xpack bosses. <br />
4.) Give the naga to horde in an Xpack that has nothing to do with azshara, the old gods, or the naga. <br />
<br />
Also just look at it, its so poorley written and contains so many typos i refuse to believe this is a real blizzard statement.<br />
Also the address listed is the HQ for Activision, which contains no developers or class balancers / testers so like boub said the shadowpriest comment makes no sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't be,you close to having over eight thousand posts! BAGEL PARTY EVERYONE!<br />
<br />
when did outland get revamped? its still pretty much the exact same way it was in TBC<br />
<br />
blizz have said a few times before they need to do something with outland since with the current 1-60 being so smooth it feels like hitting brick wall when you get to outland, so it wouldn't suprise me if they did revamp it. wether they would base an entire expansion on it i don't know, i think there would be an outcry of people claiming it to be recycled content if they did.<br />
<br />
<br />
as for Boub's post<br />
<br />
it was the karazhan starting zone that gave it away for me, i really cant see them turning a widely loved raid into a 1-10 starting zone.<br />
<br />
I dont think they will be annoucing an expansion at this blizzcon anyway, unless they do actually plan to do what they've been saying they will do since TBC and release expansions more regularly.<br />
<br />
I think this years Blizzcon will be mainly dedicated to diablo 3 and a bit towards SC2 HotS, atleast when it comes to big announcements.</div></div><hr />

it was the karazhan starting zone that gave it away for me, i really cant see them turning a widely loved raid into a 1-10 starting zone.<br />
<br />
I dont think they will be annoucing an expansion at this blizzcon anyway, unless they do actually plan to do what they've been saying they will do since TBC and release expansions more regularly.<br />
<br />
I think this years Blizzcon will be mainly dedicated to diablo 3 and a bit towards SC2 HotS, atleast when it comes to big announcements.<br />
<br />
Draenor went boom and the Outland was born...thus, Draenor got revamped...at least IMO.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Begottenson</div><div class="date">2011-07-04, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...or we could be reminded that Blizzard leaks information. Do you all really think that this site is the only place to leak info? I really hope I get a chance to eat my words here, but I've got a question: When was the last time this site accepted word from anywhere other than Blizzard itself when it came to leaks? This is an issue of self-preservation. MMO-C is a curse product, it's got a vested interest in being first. It's like AP calling out Reuters for being wrong due to a typo, when Reuters was first to break the story. <br />
<br />
And really, you guys think that Blizzard doesn't see real USD in cheaters and exploiters? Publicly, they can afford to offer an unconfirmed slap on the wrist to cheating. Internally, though, how could they ignore such a massive contribution to their bottom line? It's not as though cheating in a video game is against the law. It's just against the eula/tos. Utopia for them is making us legits feel like hackers are being punished while allowing hackers to go ahead and pay that 15 USD. Just take a look at this recent Stars hoopla: they gladly gave that guild the kill, didn't ban them, and kept nearly 1kUSD. So why not leak to the fringe, the cheaters, they pay too.<br />
<br />
Oh,and Zergal, if you remember when DKs were imbalanced because of one ability, you didn't play early wrath. You were told about it. It was beyond imbalanced. It was beyond Killing Machine.<br />
<br />
Grammar, 'shopped B/A logo, butthurt spriest author aside, 1000G (better's choice on either of two servers) that some of this information will be presented at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
<br />
No this site isn't the only place to link info but it is the most trusted! Sorry 3/4's of &quot;the other sites&quot; don't stake claim to anything new and flashy til MMO-C announces it. Boub has been one of the only one's in wow history that has been able to pin point down, datamine and get the inside scoop to stuff MONTHS before anyone else has had their hands on it. <br />
<br />
Go back to the Cata announcement, you know the part were blizzard just asked for the rights to a name, Boub was the first to make it publicly known that the name of the next expansion was Cataclysm. This was months before it was ever announced. Then the stuff that was going to be in the expansion Boub had posted again month in advance, so in advance in fact if I'm remembering correctly that some of the Blizzard staff asked Boub to take the info down!<br />
<br />
He has been spot on, on all info that he's released himself. Why do we not believe anything any of the &quot;other&quot; sites post? Well they generally only post it after Boub does and some of the stuff they do post is BULLSHIT rubbish like we saw today.<br />
<br />
Next point was about grammar and misspelling. Ok so there's one newspaper that has 100s of typos every week in their articles and you can still understand but it might take you a few more minutes to get through the articles because someone just typed it away with a care. <br />
The second newspaper has sources cited, pictures posted of actual documents and is well written with little to no mistakes. Who would you read or believe first?<br />
<br />
<br />
For this being a Curse product and yatta yatta yatta, I do believe that Curse is only there for promotional reasons. It's the same as Activision/Blizzard. I highly doubt that Boub would just denounce a legitimate news article on a major break through just because he wants to be first! Can you imagine the kind of backlash if you he denounced something that was real and called it as a fake only a month or two from now having to own up to the fact that he lied??? Doubtful guy.<br />
<br />
Seems you have some distrust or hate for the community or Boub, so what really is your issue? Or is it you're just tired of Boub being right?</div></div><hr />

Please do your research before you spread more misinformation. This is honestly the most tiresome piece of false information I continue to stumble across here. Activision merged with Vivendi Games and Vivendi Games' parent company, Vivendi SA, established a holding company named Activision Blizzard for both Blizzard Entertainmnent and Activision. The two game publishing companies continue to operate as separate entities with independent management. One does not control the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because news outlets don't get readers from being factual and realistic.<br />
It's a harsh smack from reality and what can be called &quot;news&quot;, and the extremely untalented and sensation-obsessed news sites can be (Hello Fox News!). Since after all, you don't require a talent or an education to start posting things as truth and fact on the internet, hell they don't even care much for it on TV either (hello again Fox News!). <br />
What it takes is that people learn what the fuck double-checking is and what being source critical means.<br />

Defusing the rumor is still 10 times better than let it grow on forums. I wasn't the first site to post it, and sites who did decided to let people think that it could be true. Then, people hunt for the real source and that's when there's a lot of traffic going on the said sites. <br />

It's fully expected that this years Blizzcon will see a new WoW expansion pack announcement. Blizzard announce them every 2 years. It just won't be this one. Diablo 3 and SC2 stuff aren't announcements, we already know about those products. <br />
<br />

Hey guys, This is Aphel, News Chief of MMOwned, WoW roleplayer, and lore buff. I hadn't heard of these forums today and I'm glad to see that there is such a large community for WoW lore. Thought I'd come on in and sign up. Let's talk Ethereals. I really enjoyed doing quests for their race, and I think Blizz did a great job adding more lore for them with the CDEV Round I questions. I thought the answer gave the race a lot more depth, especially since they were played off as &quot;space goblins&quot;. This new lore gave us an idea what kind suffering the Ethereals might actually be going through, being that their mortal shells were vaporized into energy and the binds they wear may be the only way to maintain that shape. Instead of assuming human forms to make their prospective customers more comfortable, they might be wearing the bandages just to hold on to the last shreds of their humanity. <br />
Also, an awesome point. How cool would it be to see the Ethereals claim an empty Karazhan or Karazhan crypts as a point of operations during an escape? During the hypothetical Argus/Outland Level 70 revamp expansion, I could see the ethereals being forced to flee from a new Legion invasion through the deactivated portals. Perhaps the Consortium or Protectorate would seek refuge and even study some of the wandering souls there? The strange presence of Malchezzar in Karazhan could even be expanded upon in their story, to some degree. I think we can guess who wrote that &quot;leak&quot;....</div></div><hr />

Its also kinda easy to spot it as fake, though. The &quot;Void&quot; thing sounds too much like the whole Void storyline that was in some of EQ2's expansions. If anyone plays EQ2, you'd be able to spot the similarities easy. There also was even a Legends of Norrath (TCG) expansion called &quot;Against the Void&quot;.<br />
<br />
There also is no &quot;Nexus Prince Hafari&quot; in game associated with the Proctorate...<br />
<br />
The next expansion would most definitely have a new Hero class. I can't see Blizzard not adding in another and instead going with 2 races again. It would be kinda weird not keeping a pace and ditching the whole Hero class thing. Saying things like &quot;we can't balance the classes, so we're not gonna add anymore in&quot; doesn't sound very proffesional or something Blizzard would even say.<br />

I've said it a thousand times and I will say it a thousand more: If you want WoW news go to mmo-champion, if you want fail go to the &quot;news&quot; website...<br />

Oh, so what, the neglected Shadow Priest class gets attention, but not the Subtlety Rogue class? What about the Beast Mastery Hunter class? This is ludicrous.<br />
Well I guess they have reached ludicrous speed, because their brain is in their feet...<br />

<br />
[05:07:48] why would a company using internal memos be suprising? <br />
[05:07:52] :| <br />
[05:08:40] Because it's Blizzard. <br />
[05:08:43] They probably use like <br />
[05:08:45] helper monkeys <br />
[05:08:53] or acrobats <br />
[05:08:56] or mimes <br />
[05:09:01] memos are too mainstream <br />

I agree you probably didn't have to point out how stupid they were 3 times, but nevertheless you were right. I think it might be suited to ask: You jelly? to them ;) Keep up the good work boub, wowhead news will never reach you.</div></div><hr />

I highly doubt an official document would say something along the lines of &quot;A ton of lore for the neglected Shadow Priest class.&quot; For one, Shadow Priest isn't a class. It's a specialization of a class. If the makers of the game didn't know that, then fuck. Second, nobody really gives a damn about the lore of a specific specialization of a class. My guy's a Paladin, he's trained in the ways of helping people (Holy/Prot) and hates undead (Ret). That's all I need to know. Also, the void isn't an entity. It's a dimension. Less work could not have been put in.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that they were working on cataclysm around or before WOTLK was released right? You do also realize that blizz plans this crap ahead of time(the themes at least)right?<br />
<br />
I have a feeling we'll be seeing the news of the next xpac at blizzcon. Just because they announce something doesn't mean they rush to finish it. They announce it they can hold off on releasing it if they want to til late 2012 or mid 2013 or really how ever long they want/need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that an expansion reveal is likely, and I agree that it would be a little harder to fill the convention with content otherwise, not to mention a bit of a dissapointment, but I still have to point out that Blizzard has signed no legally binding document to reveal a WoW expansion every other year. If they change their schedule, then they change their schedule, end of debate.<br />
<br />
They are under no obligation at all to reveal the next WoW expansion at this years Blizzcon, so we shouldn't proclaim it as a certainty. It's just a very likely scenario.</div></div><hr />

Actually that could be true, if you guys remember that leaked(that we still don''t know if it's real) blizzard feature project plan, a new expansion is supposed to be released in the 2nd quarter of 2012. So we could have an announcement of a new expansion. Or it's too early?</div></div><hr />

It's a fake too as we all know, but I have to admit it got relatively close on some occasions. It's just that stuff like Pandaria aren't likely to happen. Ever.</div></div><hr />

Yes the list is &quot;fake&quot; in some parts however, in order of expansions it has been correct.<br />

Draenor Set = Burning Crusade<br />

It was also changed after it was first brought up to fit in better with what really happened.<br />
Besides, Cataclysm fits better with the Planes set than the Maelstrom one.</div></div><hr />

Yup, and it didn't appear on the internet until the Wrath zones were known; which is funnily enough also after which it stops being entirely accurate. The rest is just blatant speculation based on already-known zones from lorebooks. Anyway, yeah, it was proven that someone made it up entirely ages ago.<br />
<br />
But on topic, Boub calls fake, it's fake. Pretty much accept anything he says without questioning since the Cata leak.</div></div><hr />

if any of this turns out to be true i will hold my hands up and say &quot;I was Wrong&quot; but it is so clearly fake...<br />

<br />
And it clearly states the concept of a villain who isn't just Rawr evil! But actually trying to help us fight the Legion, which is a change for once...<br />
<br />
But I suppose that's boring. Villains should always be obviously evil.<br />
