With the popularity of our previous weapon transmogrification list (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1051669-Heroic-Madness-of-Deathwing-Video-Weapon-Transmogrification-Happy-Holidays!), we have expanded the list to more slots for each class. Because these lists are so long and take some time to prepare, the lists will be split into groups of a few classes at a time. Today we start with Warriors, Paladins, and Death Knights. <br />
<br />
This time around items that share the same model and color are counted together in the rankings, but not items that have different color variations of the same model. Cloaks and offhands will be included in a non class specific list in the future. <br />
<br />
All of the items in the list have screenshots on the database page if you are looking for some transmogrification ideas!<br />

Blizzard and Bots<br />
Nevalistis answered some of the common complaints that come up every time a player complains about bots not being banned.<br />
<br />
It is a paying account, why ban them? <br />
<br />
This is one of the biggest misconceptions we have, and I genuinely wish we could permanently clear it up. I'll provide a few hypothetical situations (mind you, these numbers are ENTIRELY made up).<br />
<br />
Let's say 90% of botters were compromised accounts. This means that 90% of these botters aren't paying accounts; they're stolen accounts, which are generally fueled by stolen credit cards. These payments usually get disputed and taken back, which actually costs us money. If we're looking to make a purely fiscal observation, it makes no financial sense to let these continue (aside from the fact that we don't like compromised accounts to begin with - we want our players to be playing their own accounts safely and enjoyably).<br />
<br />
Let's go on the other side of the fence and say 90% of these botters were otherwise legitimate players paying for their accounts, as you purport. When players bot, other players are inconvenienced by this behavior (and trust me, you guys outnumber the botters, even if you may feel it's the other way around). The inconveniences range from normal players having difficulty farming on their own to struggling to keep up with an economy that's being forcibly fluctuated via unfair advantage. When players are inconvenienced in this manner, they submit petitions.<br />
<br />
Every petition submitted goes to a Game Master for review. A living, breathing person that is paid to provide customer service looks over it, does what's necessary for the situation (in botting cases, usually forwarding the info on to our exploitation/hacks team), and provides a response. Let's say 1-2 people are inconvenienced by a single botter (in all likelihood, we probably get many more petitions per botter than that). This would mean each botter is inconveniencing at least as many, and likely more, players that are positive to the community (the kinds of players we like and want to continue to play our game). For each botter we allow to continue botting, we potentially stand to lose more than we gain for a single subscription, just out of the sheer inconvenience it causes other players.<br />
<br />
Even if you change those numbers around of legitimate players versus compromised accounts - we only stand to lose more if we don't take action on bots (which we do, regularly).<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to step it up. Unfortunately, the bots you see are no longer just hacked accounts...it's actual players exploiting the game by using bots to farm when they sleep or are away, therefore when blizzard sends a message investigating the matter they respond as a real player and no action is taken..at least that is my assumption since two of these jerks are still regularly botting Uldum.<br />
<br />
This has been stated many times before, but action being taken against botters takes a long time to come about. The reason why is pretty simple, and another player in this thread has stated it quite eloquently, so I'll be highlighting it here:<br />
<br />
Blizzard investigates every single bot report. But as they are intelligent they wait until they can patch a hotfix for the bot before they do mass ban waves. This cures the infection instead of treating the symptom.<br />
<br />
We don't generally hit bots individually as we receive the reports because it doesn't ultimately solve the issue - they just acquire another account, either legitimately or illegitimately, and get back to botting. Instead, it's much more effective to study the bots, devise the method they are abusing, and break that method. In the process, we also construct ways of detecting the behavior, and create systems in which we can catch those bots and remove them much more quickly.<br />
<br />
It's an ever-evolving battle, however. Botters are smart too, and they figure out what it is we figured out, and develop new bots. We start the cycle over again, but it also means we've eliminated a method of exploitation and have to move on to the next. I hope that makes sense - it's a very lengthy process, and for the best intentions of that process (and preventing providing that info to those who would abuse it), I can't go into much more detail.<br />
<br />
If they don't whisper you back its a pretty sure sign that they're botting<br />
<br />
Not quite. I tend to get anti-social when I'm mining. It gets me in an almost hypnotic groove. &gt;o.o&lt;<br />
<br />
All jokes aside, not all players will respond to unsolicited whispers - after all, they know as little about your intentions (unless clearly stated) as you know about theirs. Some just feel like mining for a while, or do it while multi-tasking and reading Facebook or Reddit or something. I may or may not be speaking from experience. /coughs<br />
<br />
How many real people, actual players do YOU KNOW personally that can fly around in the exact same pattern for 48 straight hours...and sometimes in fact weeks continuously without logging off?<br />
<br />
And how many real people do you know who will sit at their computers and watch someone commit to these patterns for 48 hours straight? It's not an efficient manner to monitor bots, and we don't have our staff to do it any more than we expect our players to. It's also one of many factors that's considered, and unless you've been personally observing accounts for that long yourself, it's probably not quite working the way you perceive it to be. &gt;^.~&lt; Again, my discretion here is necessary, but suffice it to say it's taken into account.<br />
<br />
There are other, better ways to identify bots and fight them. We have a team staffed specifically for this purpose. But it is time consuming, and it regrettably needs to be to be most effective. Bots don't get removed in small numerical batches; when we strike at them, it's usually in the hundreds, if not thousands.</div></div><hr />

It all sounds good, except that their method is clearly lacking. Back in WotLK, I tracked the same botter, who was online 24/7 (as best as I could tell) for 6 months (literally, half a year). No ban occurred at any point, despite them being reported multiple times (both by myself and by others who had seen him). This bot was something of an ongoing joke on our server. There were a few others as well, though they tended to &quot;only&quot; stick around for a couple months at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that the purple recolor is second best lol. When the patch kicked in, I say maybe one person on my server in the purple judgement set. Then, about 2 weeks later when I next logged in, there was an army of clones running around SW &gt;.&gt; Every other pally was in T2 or the recolor, and every other war/DK was in the recolor. Way to butcher a really nice looking set.<br />
<br />
As for the people saying Blizz isn't doing anything against botters: Have you been keeping up with what's going on? They've shut down every single one of the more popular bots, and some of the lesser known ones. The price of gold has almost doubled in a month, and will be even more so come Jan. 25th, when the bots are officially stopped for good. Sure, other bots are bound to pop up in their place. But blizzard isn't just sitting idly by. This is one of the reasons (TOR being the main one) that I've stopped playing WoW lol.</div></div><hr />

if you're banned and appeal asap, you'll be unbanned with no questions asked. warden doesn't really do much, the bots nowadays are so far ahead of wow that they CAN'T do much. they made a choice to increase subs at any cost a few years ago. they lost control and now it is what it is.</div></div><hr />

Once you have 50 stacks of the debuff, it changes into a new debuff causes a CAPTCHA to be displayed when you attempt to gather from another node. This debuff is persistent and totally invisible, and cannot be cleared through any means other than completeing a CAPTCHA. Once you complete a CAPTCHA, the debuff is cleared and you're free to collect another 50 nodes. It's a minor inconvenience for real players, but the improvement in the marketplace for those materials will more than make up for any inconvenience.<br />
<br />
To make it fit RPG-wise it could be worked in as some kind of magical runes you need to decipher. Maybe nodes protected by said runes give extra materials also, or some sort of temporary buff.</div></div><hr />

There are bots for every MMO there is out on the market, this is not just a blizzard problem. SWTOR/GW2 will be no exception, people like making money off MMOs. Bots satisfy hundreds of thousands of players who buy gold and do not wish to farm themselves. Yes I just justified botting.

No. This &quot;scanning your RAM&quot; business isn't even possible. Modern operating systems do not allow it.<br />

Unless you run WoW as an administrative user and Blizzard secretly looks for that and &quot;scans&quot; your RAM (for what exactly?) whenever it's possible, this is just total bullshit.<br />

<br />
What in the hell are they looking for? Where are they looking for it? If you have 8 GB of physical memory (let's not even get into virtual memory), that's an enormous search space.

I shouldn't be surprised by this point, because the WoW community will complain about anything (Blizz purposefully made Deathwing die at 2% on Asian servers because they want to regain all the lost subs from China, alternatively all the lost subs are from banning gold farmers from China)...<br />
<br />
You do realise you're complaining simultaneously that Blizzard is doing something about botting and that Blizzard isn't doing anything about botting? The fact that they've managed to shut down a bot company was probably time consuming and expensive for them but it sets legal precedence. No bank will lend money to someone to set up servers for an illegal operation if they predict being embroiled in a legal case. Players may be less likely to download bots if they have to provide their credit card information to people that they know are already doing something illegal.<br />
<br />
Also, if anyone bothered to read their response, they point out that false positives and permanently banning compromised accounts is the worst outcome. They have to identify how bots function in order to ensure that the people they are banning are bot accounts. Though if I'm permitted my own tinfoil hat, the fact that they don't even pretend to be interested in anything other than profit may be a signal that ban waves area a good PR opportunity and news like that filters through to their shareholders. Complaints about bots spread out over a few months probably don't.</div></div><hr />

But as they are intelligent they wait until they can patch a hotfix for the bot before they do mass ban waves. This cures the infection instead of treating the symptom.<br />
<br />
We don't generally hit bots individually as we receive the reports because it doesn't ultimately solve the issue - they just acquire another account, either legitimately or illegitimately, and get back to botting. Instead, it's much more effective to study the bots, devise the method they are abusing, and break that method. In the process, we also construct ways of detecting the behavior, and create systems in which we can catch those bots and remove them much more quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />

None of them has ever received more than a warning for it even though one of them has been caught 3 times now. So much about the not caring about subscription money crap. If my internet wasn't so shitty I'd even do it myself, there are no consequences anyway and there's so much to gain by it.</div></div><hr />

But as they are intelligent they wait until they can patch a hotfix for the bot before they do mass ban waves. This cures the infection instead of treating the symptom.* <br />
Hugh flaw in this arguement. The botters get only hit once instead of being hit hundreds of times...which means they earn more money. Even if they manage to ban one bot-type the botters just switch to the next(which they likely already have programmed and waiting on their harddrive)...nothing is fixed with a hotfix. On top of that this encourages the normal players to bot. Not all players that bot are china-farmers and would just make a new account when being banned. So this strategy gets us way more botters than there would be around with weekly or bi-weekly ban waves. And last but not least: I know several players that made MILLIONS of gold by using bots during the first 2 months of Cataclysm....even if they ban those bot accounts now: The gold isn't there anymore. They sent it to their main account and/or bought stuff for it. Blizz is not even able to harm them anymore....and the exact same will happen with MoP(cause many players learnt from them). Unfortunately I can't post on american forums....<br />

Trust me, there are many many people who bot, usually all of biggest AH suppliers are using bot programs, people with 500k gold? Usually botters. <br />
<br />
Well, I wouldn't say 500k, given that I have 1.2million(of which likely 500k+ are from unknowingly buying cheap stuff from botters and reselling it for more gold) without of ever using a bot or working together with a botter. If someone has several millions then that is pretty suspicious tho....cause I know how hard it was to get the 1.2 million.</div></div><hr />

I think they make some system that detects a specific bot and reports the people that use it to them. And then ban them all at the same time.<br />

The first time you get a 72 hour ban and then followed by an account closure if there is a second offense. I suspect they do not post the number of bans/suspends each month because those numbers would be very high.</div></div><hr />

It's not an efficient manner to monitor bots ... Its not important to sit before monitors 0/24, just make a firewall or something else to filter hacking programs.

and can you imagine the bots in diablo when they dont have to sell gold out of game for dollars? you have the auction house in game, and blizzard cant control the bots in 7 years; its only gotten worse. the diablo auction house wont even be used by player sellers, only buyers that want something will spend money, and blizz gets a cut.<br />
<br />
blizzard solution to the bot problem is &quot;cant beat em, join em&quot; take the auction house cut on the bot sold items and players can spend money in the game, take a cut on player bought items too.<br />

Or show how rampant botting is. I have used bots since BC and did not catch my first bans/suspends until recently. I am not sure if this is caused by better detection, player reporting, or that I have gotten bolder and ban for more hours per day.

This also show's how blatantly ignorant blizzard staff is, how hard can it be to filter down the transactions made from the botting accounts n' simply ban any other account where mats / gold was sent to -.-<br />

Being banned is part of the botting game. But as long as it bring in a sizable amount more money then it costs to keep the bots going, I will continue to bot. So keep on thinking you make a difference and are helping the 'problem'.</div></div><hr />

Make mining nodes similar to archealogy nodes. You would use a device to locate some ore. Then eventually start digging until ore node appears. You farm it until the ore runs out then you have to find another ore node on the radar. Since it is not in precise coordinates it will be nearly impossible for bots to farm it properly. So that the ore gather rate is not too small each node will hold about anywhere from 5 ore to 20 ore depending on the richness of the node discovered. Make sense?</div></div><hr />

I also want to note that I don't think people realize what's going to happen to the economy if bots are removed completely from the game. How many legit players are doing the ore shuffle buying bulk from CoDers? Yes, if you're buying CoD from contacts there is a very good chance they are botters. When all that dries up the cost of MATS are going to go though the roof. Let's face it, legit farmers are the minority these days so all these people spoiled by buying cheap mats on the AH will suffer.</div></div><hr />

Alright I'll take some time to write my thoughts down about this following matter -- the positive and negative impacts of these &quot;bots&quot; in today's standard.<br />
<br />
I am a WoW Vet that has been playing ever since the first release of Vanilla (To be exact April 14, 2004 when patch 0.16 came out. Miss those days :()<br />
Throughout the years I have played on different realms, classes, professions, and lemme tell you this -- <br />
the one factor that always has changed were the markets in AH.<br />
<br />
Botters who were first introduced at the early era of Burning Crusade dramatically decrease the value of the market price, to the point it was affordable to the general surplus population to acquire. <br />
<br />
The currency 'gold' were very hard to acquire back then, hence leaving the low caste system to suffer from unable to enjoy the 'real' experience of the game.<br />
<br />
Thankfully the Professions helped thrive and circumvent the the currency to help the players establish some profits but because of game's mechanics and restriction back then, materials for professions were also tedious to obtain.<br />
<br />
So with that in mind, automated 'Botters' who of course uses programs to replace human interaction to obtain these said'Mats', helped the market to inflate to the point where it is now dirt cheap.<br />
<br />
To the general concerns ladies and gent's; the economics behind these are really, surprisingly-- mutual. Despite the fact that of course these type of marketing is against the ToS of Blizzard's, or in any general MMO's we can't put a blind eye on these facts.<br />
<br />
Another positive perspective that you can analyze about these automated botters' are of course the flow of profit margins the game company is making off from their monthly subscription fees.<br />
<br />
Now before anyone points out, &quot;Well there are millions of legit players, but only hundred-thousands of botters&quot; scenario. try and think about this major points:<br />
<br />
-Monthly Subscriptions<br />
-Large in demand<br />
-Supply is low<br />
<br />
If you look at these statistically, by eliminating the botters', snowball effects will concur not only Blizzard's monthly margins, but also in-game economics will crash; leaving behind a rise of item value, leaving behind a probability lost of 38% (this is based from the total subscribed users in today's WoW of 8 million), which will in turn to a bad decision of the company.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now to point out the negative impacts of these bots', it instigates a black market of which consumers can then just simply buy the 'gold' currency for actual real life money. This is of course frowned upon on as for better reasons, users can be easily scammed. <br />
<br />
This also promotes malicious intentions across the internet including spamming, harassment, or other means that can disrupt the player experience that's trying to have fun.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this message have given an insight of the real-world assessment from a Game Developer's point of view.<br />

<br />
<br />
botting bg's, dungeons and other things that are in no way helpful to the co-op parts of the game i do have a problem with, legit account or not. those things are in no way helpful to anyone except the player who is botting.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Crack down on BG and Dungeon botters. Crack down on hacked accounts. leave farmers alone. its good for the wow economy, and at the very least, casual players that know a bit about how to make legit gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it seems like blizzard doesnt do anything about the bots because they dont care and their #1 priority we know is making money. even 1 lost subscription would be bad for business, but who cares if 1000 players get undercut in the AH for in game gold, or these bots help make gold which is sold out of game for real money.<br />
<br />
thats the real problem, the bots make gold and sell to players for dollars. bots, gold selling, hacking theres no way this manipulation is isolated, it has to be the same people doing these activities. they're all connected.</div></div><hr />

what you say may be true, at least in part. it would be impossible to measure the extra supply of mats in the AH or a player's affordability at any given time, not to mention inflation.<br />
<br />
if what you said is true, then blizzard just intentionally lied in that whole blue post, and has been lying this whole time when they say the bots are a concern for them, and they conduct bot sweeps, that they're trying to eliminate bots and hacking. if what you say is true, blizzard is just as much complicit to the problem as the bots and gold farmers, for knowing and able to do something, but not caring, or not wanting to ruin those &quot;positive&quot; effects you mentioned.<br />
<br />
if they never took a stand against the issue, and still today dont claim to be fighting the bots, it would be another story, they could just ay its good for the economy and professions make up for a player's loss of selling mats, now they can sell crafted items with little overhead, but blizzard didn't, therefore what exactly are we arguing here?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pacster</div><div class="date">2012-01-01, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As an economics student i have written several lengthy case studies pertaining to the economy of wow (it helps to have a prof who plays as well). as a small, limited economy with few substitute products and a large and varied array of players, it makes for a very interesting study of how market systems work. since most botters are competing for currently used items such as elementium and herbs, the huge increase in supply leads to lower prices, players will figure out a way to pay those prices, or get what they need another way, leading to equilibrium prices, regardless of the source of the materials. smaller realms, with less players (and less botters) have much much higher prices as predicted by a simple market model. the fortunate part for the player base is that the botters are not a monopoly and work the same as any basic market mechanism would. as long as a botter is on a legitimate account, i have no problem with them botting. it lowers prices, it leaves more time to farm gold in more lucrative ways, and in the end, i come out on top. cracking down on hacked accounts seems like a much better way to spend time and resources than legitimate bots. the only argument against legit bots is an ethical, and ToS one, in which case, ya, i understand. the long run implication is that the botters will have more money, the 'real' price of items goes down, and the nominal price might increase. the relatively small numbers of players that do this on each realm however is not likely to be the driving force for price inflation: easy gold from dailies, a ton of gold from leveling an alt, and the rediculous amount of gold you can make by just doing dungeons and normal pve stuff is what is driving prices to ridiculous levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
botting bg's, dungeons and other things that are in no way helpful to the co-op parts of the game i do have a problem with, legit account or not. those things are in no way helpful to anyone except the player who is botting.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Crack down on BG and Dungeon botters. Crack down on hacked accounts. leave farmers alone. its good for the wow economy, and at the very least, casual players that know a bit about how to make legit gold.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is false. The price only increases for the lazy ones that are not willing to farm at all. For all others the price does not increase at all without bots cause they will pay more but as well gain more for their mats(which balances the whole thing for them). <br />
If blizz wanted to decrease the price on the market then they don't have to allow bots(which hurt those that are willing to farm)...but instead just double the amount of gained mats or decrease the number of mats needed. As it is it benefits the lazy twice...while it hurts those that play the game as intended by blizz(cause they obviously want us to farm some and create some kind of economy...or they would just give us all mats for free).<br />
<br />
Last but not least the price is not just made by the amount of mats...but as well by the amount of gold around. So the price can't get THAT high at all...or people just won't buy anymore. And there are more than enough things on the AH where bots have no or almost no impact on...and they still have a decent price.<br />
<br />
Economically taking out bots means that the prcie will increase to a level where more people are willing to farm which will then again decrease the price. At the end you will have a decent price that you can count on...and not those crazy price-spikes and dumping prices that we see at the WoW-market.<br />
But even if you would take out bots now it would need months for the market to get in balance again...simply cause many traders have bags full of mats that they can't seel for any decent price due to botters(let's take void crystals. On my realm they often sell for 5gold/stack. To get a stack full of void crystals a player would need an hour or so. To make 1 daily for 15 gold a player needs about 3 minutes. So the price for void crystals is obviously a joke...and that's due to botters. On the other extreme those botters are willing to pay ANY price for items cause due to their bots they got more than enough gold....so high-end equipment is being sold to them for 30k-50k....which the average player is not able to pay. So not only do normal players lose the ability to get decent money for their mats...but as well can't pay for the rare stuff cause that price is increased by botters.).</div></div><hr />

First, they tell you they don't want botters because it is detrimental to the game. Even if they are all legitimate accounts or hacked accounts and the detrimental effects will cause them to lose customers. So it doesn't matter if the accounts are legitimate or not. Ban them, if the account was legitimate and a player wants to play again. Force them to purchase an authenticator. It was their idiotic web surfing that got their account hacked in the first place.Second, they need to stop using analogies like &quot;They are treating the infection instead of the symptoms.&quot; Sorry, but trying to put it in a logical way that makes it seem like they are trying to act smarter than they are is just dumb and people shouldn't fall for it. In the medical field you often treat the sympoms and the infection, if you don't treat sympoms a patient WILL often try to find some way to alleviate symptoms and will cause more harm than he helps.How can you relate this to WoW exactly? People who are normal paying customers get sick of not being able to collect materials because botters are jacking all the nodes. They do some searching on the internet and find a bot to download and try. Either that person is now among the botters or he gets his account hacked spreading the inection much like picking it at would if this were a real infection.What it all comes down to is money.Say the next content patch that is referenced in one of those two posts that says they recently have broken two bots and it will be released in the next client patch. Say it breaks 20,000 bots among all world of warcraft accounts. Say that it is 4 weeks from a new client patch. By them delaying it they are going to look at $300,000.00 profit they wouldn't see by implementing it immediatly.Then, what does it cost to implement a client patch spur of the moment to break a bot? In that case they would be losing over $300k.Then, it is always suggested, ship authenticators with expansions and force people to use them. I always have heard the same BS canned response that come from someone at Blizzards HQ. They are already made at cost. So what? That is $4 per account. Less if you take out the fact that part of the $4 is the shipping. If WoW came out with an expansion yearly, Blizzard would be looking at me paying almost $220.00 per year. They have the means to handle this. They need to cure the infection and treat the symptoms because it pisses a lot of legitimate customers off.</div></div><hr />

I honestly don't understand why people don't have one. It's either: pay £7? (free app user here, don't know the price) or download one for your iPhone or Android/Windows based phone for FREE. There days you don't even notice it on your account as it rarely ask for a code (when logging on from the same pc/location) compared to when it first came out (required a code for every log in, got annoying maybe, but really just became an automatic part of the log in process)<br />

Make mining nodes similar to archealogy nodes. You would use a device to locate some ore. Then eventually start digging until ore node appears. You farm it until the ore runs out then you have to find another ore node on the radar. Since it is not in precise coordinates it will be nearly impossible for bots to farm it properly. So that the ore gather rate is not too small each node will hold about anywhere from 5 ore to 20 ore depending on the richness of the node discovered. Make sense?<br />

I personally used to have a phone authenticator but there were two issues that made me decide to get rid of it. (one is no longer a problem and has been adjusted)<br />
<br />
1-If my phone gets stolen, dies, breaks or gets wiped I am pretty much screwed. It is an annoying process to get Blizz to unhook an authenticator when you no longer have it.<br />
<br />
2-In the old days you had to login with it each time you logged in. As someone who has owned 3+ accounts this was annoying when you multibox.</div></div><hr />

When I moved to phase where I really didn't care about my account, because I was quitting WoW and still had about 5 weeks before expiration, I started botting. <br />
<br />
At first, I took it slowly and let my bot farm mats only over night. Then I was like *f!ck that sh!t*.. lets see if I'll get ban. So I ran that Bot for two weeks 24/7 (-maintenance), ore, flowers, gems,volatiles .. everywhere, two 6tab guild banks completely full and surprise surprise.. no ban. I even posted everything on the AH to be even more suspicious. Nothing again.<br />
<br />
So if Blizzard says that they are working hard on this problem, it's a lie. Even with basic data mining a druid that is flying and gathering stuff for two week, pretty much non-stop, should be at least suspicious.</div></div><hr />

The Solution is much simpler than anyone thinks, Put a captcha every 10 mines/plants/skiins that a player gets, If you dont get the captcha right the 3rd time, you have a cooldown &quot;CANT mine/herb/skin for another 4 hours&quot;<br />

<br />
To add to this, most farmers have someone who they sell to specifically. I know this because in WOLTLK I personally had 6 farmers on my server who would send me their loads of materials daily and I would use those for crafting and then resell stuff on the AH. If you think some of those people are buying them at the prices listed on the AH people are also joking themselves. Just some examples for people of what I payed in WotLK and normal ah prices.<br />
<br />
Prices per Stack...<br />
Item--AH Price--My Price<br />
Saronite Ore--15g--8g<br />
Titanium Ore--160g--100g<br />
Uncommon Gems--2-6g---1g<br />
Rare Gems--6-20g--5-10g<br />
Herbs--20g--10g<br />
Forst Lotus--280g--120g<br />
<br />
By the end of the expansion, I was using a transmute master to convert all saronite bars into titanium bars and then titanium bars into titansteel bars. I was crafting every piece of epic gear from blacksmithing and it would sell on the AH (Including stuff like ulduar BoEs, ToC crafted pieces, and LK Epics).<br />
<br />
I would break even on the Titanium Ore prospects after selling the dust that came with them, the result was basically free gems from Titanium Prospects.<br />
<br />
And since I saw all the eternals at a 50% or greater discount, I could buy leather and cloth from the AH and craft items at pretty much 1/2 what they sold on the AH. I had so much gold that I bought heroic runs of icc on pretty much every one of my 80 toons.<br />
<br />
The moral of this story, no, farmers don't help the economy. They help 1 or 2 people by providing them materials at a cost that makes crafting epically profitable allowing them to collect thousands upon thousands of gold and making it so no one else can profit off professions regularly like BS/LW/Tailoring etc.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it isn't hard finding yourself farmers to buy from either.</div></div><hr />

QFT <br />
<br />
during the christmas i was reporting one player over and over again (he has two accounts - mining on two servers simultaneously - both his mining chars have same name)<br />
<br />
i was creating tickets OVER AND OVER AGAIN - they just closed it and the guy was still online..<br />
<br />
ofc this was NOT compromised account - i spoke to him few times. in our guild it is common that people talk with each other about bots and their experiences with them OPENLY on TS (for fishing, mining, everything..)<br />
<br />
it is quite annoying to see the guy being online for days and only relogging to his another char - i call it &quot;AH-bot&quot; who posts all this mined ore two auction house every now and then when mining bot needs to clear his bags..<br />
<br />
it is cool that there are banwaves - but they are so rare that nobody gives a f*ck! to get rid of the botters it is NOT enough. they really need to start investigating them one by one. when there is report of a player using a bot (especially if it is from reliable source) they MUST investigate it, ban the botter IMMEDIATELY and REWARD the guy who did their homework FOR THEM! only then you get rid of the botters because they will be scared and whole their business will be ruined! blizz gives temp. bans for inappropriate behavior so why it is so damn hard when botter is reported?!<br />
<br />
and btw one hour in Uldum, one hour in Twilight Highlands every now and then and one realm is cleared from bots ;-) it is not that hard and not time consuming at all but it will cost them much more money than openly lying about their alleged actions and how people with stolen account would be banned unjustly.<br />
<br />
this &quot;stolen account&quot; lie is soooo ridiculous. ofc that GREAT MAJORITY of botters are REGULAR players..<br />
<br />
GRR - so many PR lies in one blue post.. and you guys from MMO-C did not add a comment for uninformed players that this bullsh*t must be taken with a grain of salt or not believed at all :-/ i mean - there can be people who still believes that blizz is doind something against botters - which is kinda sad :-(<br />
<br />

<br />
From what I recall after every &quot;ban wave&quot; (and there were some botting ban waves in the past, give Blizz some credit) prices skyrocket up and everyone is pissed off and yelling how people are greedy :D. And the only ones satisfied in this situation are those few justice league nerds ...<br />
It's not like one ban wave will solve everything, by the time Blizzard is done banning there are already new bots anyway.<br />
<br />
this is just wrong on so many levels.<br />
<br />
1) few posts back some guy offered a anti-bot solution with captchas - this idea is sooo good and it can prevent bots from farming ores and herbs.<br />
2) yes, price are skyrocketing first few days but economy will get to new equilibrium few days later and if prices are still big? blizz can fix it by increasing ores and herbs gathered per node.. no bots are involved and economy is ok again<br />
<br />
there ARE solutions which CAN work but blizz refuses to implement them and people with stockholm syndrome like you are even justifying botters for helping an economy :-)<br />
<br />
ok - i give you another example - when WWII ended as well as constant flow of jews to Nazi concentration camps many people in gas industry and military industry lost their jobs because there was no need to produce that many gas and guns for obvious reasons. was that good or bad? ;-)<br />

Does this mean you could bot all you like and just stop botting when a new patch hits, wait for the new bot to come out and start botting again?<br />
That would be very stupid...<br />

that is how it works :-) on bot sites they are even announces that bot is currently NOT safe until new antiantibotfix is applied. ;-)</div></div><hr />

People bot to avoid mundane tasks. Does WoW has mundane tasks? Except for raiding and pvping which require awareness (oh wait there are Rotation Bots) WoW is filled with grinding in one way or another. Be it mob farming, mining, herbing, archeology. If you want to kill boting then you have to make those activities dynamic and entertaining and not worth boting. We know for a fact this will never... EVER happen so bots will never... EVER dissapear. Killing off Pirox might be great news but what about tens more that are still around and few more arrising every patch?<br />
<br />
Captcha is a very drastic solution, effective but way to drastic. Nothing breaks immersion more than every once in a while &quot;hey! stop playing and let us check if your still in front of your keyboard&quot;. It might not be a problem at start but seeing something like that 10~20 times a day during your gaming session can really put of people from keep playing.</div></div><hr />

just making them useless but ur fine keep trying<br />
They really need to ban EVERYONE who use ANY bot<br />
Because massively banning thousands of people at once doesn't do any good. Right?<br />
<br />
Banning one person as you find them using a bot does not stop them from getting a new account and picking the bot back up and continuing the process. You've done nothing but waste your own money on a worthless ban. Banning a player (or thousands) for using the bot after finding a way to break the bot's function keeps them from botting again until they figure out how to side step the system again.<br />

I have personally come across some of these &quot;botters&quot; in Uldum [and other locations]. I think I have found a way to stop them, or at least it works for the few that I have run into. Let me tell you what I found.<br />
<br />
One day I was farming Whiptail in Uldum, when I came across a troll priest farming too. He landed at an herb, looked like he was picking it, mounted &amp; flew away. If I get to an herb at the same time someone else does, I stick around until they mount &amp; take off, just in case they are not able to pick it up, I can grab it myself. This priest flew away without picking up the herb. I flew behind him &amp; watched him/her do it a few more times. I sent the character a whisper, informing him/her that he missed a few herbs. Well, the character stopped dead in their tracks. I continued around my farming loop of Uldum &amp; came back to the same spot that I had sent the whisper to the character &amp; the character still had not moved. I sent in a ticket to have the person investigated. Within an hour, the character logged off. I came back in a couple of hours &amp; the person was back again. This time, they were picking the herbs, but I sent them a tell to say I was glad they were not a bot. The person again froze dead in their tracks &amp; did not move again for a few times around my farming route. I entered another ticket. The character logged off within another hour. The character returned again the next day, same thing.<br />
<br />
So I am not sure if Blizzard is actually investigating these concerns or is just putting a &quot;band-aid&quot; on the situation &amp; logging the character off or if they are in fact investigating the issue &amp; correcting the &quot;bot farmers&quot; scripts that they are using.<br />
<br />
The economy in WoW is a supply &amp; demand, those that have the supply, can make the demand for the price. The botters have the advantage &amp; are in fact hurting the economy in the game more than players know.<br />
<br />
So, what can you [as a player of the game] do to try to get those botters to stop? Send them a friendly whisper &amp; see if they stop. If they stop, come back in 5-6 minutes &amp; see if they are still there, if they are, put in a ticket &amp; report them. What harm can it do to send someone a whisper to prevent them from making YOUR gold? What harm can it do to have a GM investigate YOUR findings? If Blizzard continues to get these tickets &amp; are overwhelmed with answering them, investigating them, &amp; tracking them down, maybe they will do more to stop them before they get a chance to start.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ozztick</div><div class="date">2012-01-03, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a farmer of many things, not to sell, but because I am a guild leader &amp; supplies are needed for items required in the guild. I have personally come across some of these &quot;botters&quot; in Uldum [and other locations]. I think I have found a way to stop them, or at least it works for the few that I have run into. Let me tell you what I found. One day I was farming Whiptail in Uldum, when I came across a troll priest farming too. He landed at an herb, looked like he was picking it, mounted &amp; flew away. If I get to an herb at the same time someone else does, I stick around until they mount &amp; take off, just in case they are not able to pick it up, I can grab it myself. This priest flew away without picking up the herb. I flew behind him &amp; watched him/her do it a few more times. I sent the character a whisper, informing him/her that he missed a few herbs. Well, the character stopped dead in their tracks. I continued around my farming loop of Uldum &amp; came back to the same spot that I had sent the whisper to the character &amp; the character still had not moved. I sent in a ticket to have the person investigated. Within an hour, the character logged off. I came back in a couple of hours &amp; the person was back again. This time, they were picking the herbs, but I sent them a tell to say I was glad they were not a bot. The person again froze dead in their tracks &amp; did not move again for a few times around my farming route. I entered another ticket. The character logged off within another hour.

Or if they receive a report of someone botting, why don’t they flag that account and compare it to the programmed actions of the known bot programs? Sure, that could fall under the Bot program TOS, but isn’t it unlikely that someone would be sued, considering the nature of bot programs anyways? Or, even go as so far as to change node location for materials / herbs required for current expansion?* I have zero programming ability// skill / knowledge, so I don’t even know what an undertaking like that would entail or even if it would be possible*Just a random thought.</div></div><hr />
