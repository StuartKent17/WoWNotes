Statistics: Dragon Soul Difficulty Changes Impact<br />
Today we take a look at the impact of the 5% difficulty decrease (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216008-dragon-soul-difficulty-changes/) of Dragon Soul that went live the week of January 31. Spine of Deathwing also saw a 15% reduction (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216585-world-of-warcraft-patch-432/) in health of the tendons at this time. This time around the sample size was ~5.6 million characters. As always, keep in mind that this sample contains many alts and should not be looked at for the percentage of the overall population that completed an achievement. <br />
<br />
We first look at Heroic Spine of Deathwing and Madness of Deathwing achievements added each week, seeing roughly 4x the number of new kills the week that the buff went live, then a lower amount of kills during the following week. The decrease in new kills is sharper on Spine of Deathwing at ~27% and only ~5% on Madness of Deathwing.<br />
<br />
We don't see the same effect for the number of new Heroic and Normal Deathwing kills. Using Destroyer's End (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/6177/destroyers-end/) as our method of measurement, we see only a small spike, not even passing the number of new kills that were earned during the week of December 6. <br />
<br />
The 5% decrease in difficulty made a much bigger impact to players that were stuck on a Heroic boss than it did for those who were stuck on a normal boss. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Today was a holiday in the US and Bashiok and Zarhym are in France, leaving us with some tweets from Chris Metzen!<br />
<br />
So how many of you WoW players have played Warcraft 3?<br />
<br />
If a Warcraft character could come back from death, which would y'all like to see (provided the story was good)?<br />
<br />
None. Please PLEASE don't bring any more back. Make NEW stories.<br />
Working on it! Takes years to get you to care about new ones!<br />
<br />
Hey man, any chance we can see some more strong female villains in WoW apart from Naga? A female big bad would be cool sometime<br />
I'll see what I can do.<br />

They said when they put in the nerf that a lot of guilds were roadblocked on heroic content, and it seems like heroic kills saw a spike, but regular is still going up steadily. I'd say it shows that gear coupled with somewhat elite skill is required for heroics, whereas regular is far less gear dependent (and less skill dependent as well).</div></div><hr />

Lol, Waiting for people to come on and go OMG LOOK HOW BIG THE GRAPH GETS without taking into account the scale bars. Remember as said this is out of a sample of 5.6 million and the scale is in SINGLE thousands. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrExcelion</div><div class="date">2012-02-21, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The big thing with Spine wasn't just a 5% nerf, but an additional 15% less hp on the tendon. On 25, getting 2-2-2 is pretty easy now. It doesn't surprise me that the curves for Spine and Madness look pretty similar because once you down Spine, the Madness kills only 1-5 days off. It took my guild two full nights to down Madness. Eventually one plate is going to be feasible on 10 man with Heroism, and that's when you'll see another significant spike. A 10 man 8/8 guild I'm friends with said they weren't far off when they tried, but a 10 or 15% nerf should allow them to do it consistently.<br />

I think a really awesome idea would be to actually have a War of the Ancients raid where you follow both Malfurion and Illidans side of the story, and have players involved in the battle fighting against the Burning Legion somehow. Would be good to include the battles of the demi-gods that fight there too. Otherwise I really would want to see Turalyon and Alleria back in the mix since they are currently MIA, and even more Medivh would be great. Blizzard should play it safe though and not bring anyone back from the dead, but re-incorporate old characters back in through means of Caverns of Time (as they did with the Well of Eternity instance).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;thousands&quot; from 5.6 million is as it should be - doubt all 5.6 million are heroic users ;)<br />
Now to wonder what does other people do since most guilds are still stuck at normals and heroic guilds are almost clearing the raid already. Also yes, please please strong females apart from Sylvanas (who has been little silent). Now to cross fingers &quot;enemy female story&quot; doesnt turn into &quot;lol sylv went bad&quot;</div></div><hr />

I can confirm it's similar on 10-man; we've just started progressing on it, and we're not seeing major issues downing the tendons with 2 lifts of each plate. I can, however, see how this would have been an uphill struggle before the nerfs, and really commend the people who managed to do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sensa</div><div class="date">2012-02-21, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real interesting comparison, and I think it's not currently possible due to Blizzard hiding the data from the Chaud's of the world, is how many in that same sample had completed Dragon Soul on LFR difficulty. <br />
<br />
The reason that would be an interesting comparison is that a total of less than 400,000 (heroic/normal DS achieve) seems low to me. It may well reflect a &quot;negative&quot; impact of LFR in that having &quot;seen the content&quot; and gotten welfare epics the incentive to continue at &quot;higher&quot; difficulty levels may have been greatly reduced.<br />
<br />
If LFR, in actuality, is lowering the incentive and/or desire to do normal/heroic raids then it's introduction may have had unintended consequences that will have a significant negative impact on the future of what we now refer to as &quot;raiding&quot; in WoW.</div></div><hr />

More then 1.6 million downed anub 25 in 25 man raiding guilds alone, this excludes the strict 10man guilds.<br />

The usual results vary for each person disclaimer. For myself I was able to find PuG raids most of the time from a month after Cata launch on my high population server during late night hours and even found raids on launch night of 4.2. Then 4.3 launches and trade chat practically dried up on both players leading PuGs and players wanting to join a PuG for normal DS for the first three weeks with a tiny murmur on the fourth week during the late night hours that I have time to play. <br />
<br />
At this point I was getting sick of running DS in LFR and did not even want to bother with jumping into a PuG or forming one. For me, LFR killed the motivation I used to have to raid and its enjoyment or working together with other players to tackle a challenge. I used to feel like I was a hero in this game and now I feel like some kind of god and that gets boring.</div></div><hr />

So you are bored on lfr ds, yet to lazy to start a normal pug. Sounds like your own fault there for being lazy.</div></div><hr />

And don't be blind by assuming everyone is an idiot. Most people know it's a sample. I'm just saying for what has been provided, it's not that severe of a problem when people say it going to be easy mode the moment the buff came through. And for what's being shown, it just doesn't seem like it's the case.</div></div><hr />

Rather then bring back a character people like, (and from what ive heard people would like to fight again) make a new character, which people will bitch about not being in the lore, or be noncanon, or etc? maybe if its exactly the same thing again id sgree with you, but if they at least made it different id be all for reusing characters.</div></div><hr />

I find both these posts sum up how I and several of my guildies felt about completing DS because we started late on DS due to still levelling characters, having run LFR for several weeks before we had a group of players ready to do normal mode, the enjoyment of completing each boss didn't actually fulfil the satisfaction of raiding since we had already done it, and having just done madness for the first time as a guild group 2 weeks ago, we have no motivation to actually continue since its the same thing over and over again, just tuned a bit harder. <br />
<br />
What I wished blizzard had done was make another heroic dungeon stepping stone, which gave 384 gear so that when you came to progressing into 10/25man DS it didn't feel like you had already completed the instance several times and thus the incentive to continue simply wasn't there. Where as if it was first time doing it in 10/25man mode the desire for the kill on each boss and to progress would be greater.<br />
<br />
I don't mind the idea of LFR but the fact that it was done on the same raid for which we were going to be spending the next few months on really degrades the raid as a whole.</div></div><hr />

That encounter is a joke now compared to the unnerfed oneThey got -15% Tendon HP. Blood of Neltharion now gets one more stack, which result in 20% less damage taken. Afaik there was another stealthnerf I just can't seem to remeber...And of course, on top of that (almost) everything does 5% less damage and has 5% less HP</div></div><hr />

This was the principal change that got many raids past that boss, right to Madness. He is clearly harder than the new spine in 10m yes, but he doesn't block the whole progress because of one weird mechanic that requires class stacking like the old Spine encounter. That's why we see a jump in his kills too.</div></div><hr />

Kind of the opposite on my server. In T11 there were no pug raids until well after 4.1 dropped. Then T12 besides trash runs didn't really start showing up till after the nerfs and of course legendary things were always reserved. In contrast T13 normal mind you I see at least one pug a day. On busier nights of course have much more.<br />
<br />
On another note I wonder if they are going to nerf it some more.</div></div><hr />

There were significant nerfs to Heroic Spine of Deathwing in addition to the general 5% DS nerf. You can't separate out the impact of the 5% from either of the last two fights because (i) there were no additional nerfs to regular modes aside from the 5% and (ii) H Spine is the major bottleneck in heroic progression.<br />
<br />
If you want to show us an analysis that makes sense, please look at other fights than the last two.</div></div><hr />

Verified the tweet, it's legit.<br />
<br />
And frankly, I agree with tweeter, he/she (seems like a she) is spot on, they murdered enough of the old lore, and except for Old Gods and Azshara there is barely anything left, so yeah you are kinda out of touch on this one (conspiracy theories ftw? no).<br />

Can we please stop bringing characters back? The game is stale enough as it is, resurrecting YET ANOTHER lore figure is only going to make it worse.<br />
<br />
Just wanting to point out that at the end of my post I say how Blizzard should play it safe and not just simply resurrect someone from the dead, but rather let us be able to experience some of the Lore (use Caverns of Time) that isn't in game atm, like the War of the Ancients. I also go on to say that it would be awesome to bring Turalyon and Alleria back into the game and involve them somehow, which wouldn't be resurrecting anyone since they are currently MIA. On another note (not directing this at you namelessone), I think that there are too many people adding their 2 cents into this topic that do not know any of the lore other than what is presented in WoW. Before you start saying &quot;Dont bring back any more characters from the dead&quot;, you should read up on your Lore and remember you dont necessarily have to resurrect a character to re-involve them into the game or more Lore.</div></div><hr />

It is harder to keep 25 person teams together, simple as that. Love it, hate it...Blizz decided it was okay and here we are. More casual players, fewer willing to commit the time and energy to be part of a big end game team.</div></div><hr />
