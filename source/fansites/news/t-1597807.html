You can find some more detailed overviews of buildings such as the Inn (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4281-Garrisons-Inn-and-Tavern-Dev-Interview-Launcher-Upgrade-Blue-Tweets-Fan-Art), Lumber Mill (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4290-Garrisons-Lumber-Mill-New-Garrison-Monument-Blue-Posts-Blue-Tweets-Blizzard-Art), Trading Post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4287-Garrisons-Trading-Post-Highmaul-LFR-Open-Blue-Tweets-Wowcraft-11), and more in previous news posts.<br />
In this series of blog posts, we’re giving you a much closer look at how Garrisons are shaping up and how you can expect to interact with them in Warlords of Draenor. This second installment maps out the buildings that make up a fully armed and operational Garrison and how they impact your professions.<br />
As we mentioned in part 1 of this series, we want the process of staking your claim on Draenor to fundamentally shape your gameplay experience. Your Garrison mainly comprises buildings and the Followers who inhabit them. As your Garrison grows, so will your options and opportunities to use these assets to your advantage on Draenor. The Followers that populate your Garrison will grow in number and power, and what they can do for you depends which buildings you choose to construct in your base.<br />
<br />
Start Small, Think Big<br />
Even in its fledgling state, your Garrison will contribute to your professional development almost immediately. You’ll have many choices for what to build, and your choices directly impact what your Followers can do and the rewards you’ll get from them.<br />
<br />
The space you have available for buildings is determined by your Garrison Tier. At Garrison Tier 1, you’ll have one small and one large plot for buildings of those sizes. Quests will take you through placing a building that matches one of your primary professions in your first small plot and a Barracks in your first large plot.<br />
<br />
At Garrison Tier 2, you’ll gain one additional small plot, one medium plot, and room for three of four preset buildings: the Fishing Shack (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/64-fishing-shack), Herb Garden (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/29-herb-garden), Pet Menagerie (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/42-menagerie), and Lunarfall Excavation (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/61-lunarfall-excavation) (Alliance) or Frostwolf Mine (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/61-lunarfall-excavation) (Horde). Everyone can eventually unlock and use all four presets, and each provides a great deal of synergy with its associated activities. For example, the Fishing Shack not only allows you to fish in Garrison waters and take on daily fishing quests—it also makes it possible for you to attract Nat Pagle (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/followers/202-nat-pagle-nat-pagle) as a Follower and gives him a place to work with you on Draenor.<br />
<br />
Quests to gain access to each of the four preset buildings become available as you level up your character. You can obtain the mine at character level 92, the Fishing Shack at level 94, the Herb Garden at level 96, and the Pet Menagerie at level 98.<br />
<br />
At Garrison Tier 3, you’ll gain room for one more building of each size (one small, one medium, one large, and the final preset)—but to start, you’ll want to familiarize yourself with your first building and then consider what you’re going to do with the other precious spaces that become available.<br />
<br />
Small plots can hold the Engineering Works (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/91-engineering-works), Alchemy Lab (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/76-alchemy-lab), Enchanter’s Study (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/93-enchanters-study), Gem Boutique (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/96-gem-boutique), Salvage Yard (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/52-salvage-yard), Scribe’s Quarters (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/95-scribes-quarters), Storehouse (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/51-storehouse), Tailoring Emporium (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/94-tailoring-emporium), Forge (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/60-the-forge), or Tannery (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/90-the-tannery).<br />
<br />
Buildings level up, too, so you’ll want to raise both your Garrison and each building inside your walls to reach their highest potential. You do this by obtaining blueprints for the building and level you want from the blueprint vendor:<br />
<br />
Level 1 blueprints all become available to you when your Garrison reaches Tier 2.<br />
Level 2 blueprints become available at different times depending on their size:<br />
<br />
Small buildings: Reach level 96 or complete the Talador zone.<br />
Medium buildings: Reach level 98 or complete the Spires of Arak zone.<br />
Large buildings: Reach level 100 or complete the Nagrand zone.<br />
<br />
Level 3 blueprints become available as you complete certain achievements across Draenor.<br />
Level 3 blueprints are account-wide. Once you unlock one on a character, it’s available to all characters on your account.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do Medium Well<br />
Some of the most impactful decisions you’ll make when planning your Garrison will come when it’s time to choose medium-sized buildings. Medium buildings, unlike the smaller professional workspaces, make use of more real estate to give your Followers room to work on bigger projects with you and interact with each other.<br />
<br />
Medium buildings include the Horde’s Frostwall Tavern (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/34-lunarfall-inn) and the Alliance’s Lunarfall Inn (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/34-lunarfall-inn), the Barn (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/24-barn), the Lumber Mill (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/40-lumber-mill), the Gladiator’s Sanctum (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/159-gladiators-sanctum), and the Trading Post (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/111-trading-post).<br />
<br />
If you go with the Inn or Tavern, each day you’ll find a visitor who offers you a dungeon quest with generous rewards. At level 100, you’ll get two such quests per day. As it grows, you’ll have the opportunity to recruit random followers with traits and abilities that you particularly want—and at its grandest, it unlocks Treasure Hunt missions with hefty payouts.<br />
<br />
The level 1 Barn grants the ability to capture clefthoof, elekk, wolves, and talbuk for leather and fur that can be used in Leatherworking and Tailoring. To make a capture, you’ll drop a trap and coax low-health creatures over it. At level 2, you’ll learn how to capture boars and riverbeasts for rare meats that are used to cook the most powerful recipes, and at level 3, the Barn will allow you to capture elite beasts and extract their Savage Blood, an ingredient for epic crafted armor and weapons.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, over in the Gladiator’s Sanctum, you’ll earn a bonus to your out-of-combat regen in outdoor zones on Draenor, gain the ability to fall safely and breathe underwater outdoors on Draenor, learn a unique damage reduction ability, and ultimately gain access to the intense Highmaul Coliseum gladiator tournament that unlocks a special Nemesis PvP quest series.<br />
<br />
The Nemesis quest line (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests?filter-search=Nemesis&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90) challenges PvP players to focus on hunting down enemy players of specific races to earn renown and over a dozen character titles such as Draenei Destroyer, Troll Hunter, Orcslayer, and Gnomebane. Truly vigilant players who complete every Nemesis quest will be rewarded with the title Warlord of Draenor.<br />
<br />
Large and In Charge<br />
Your Garrison is never intended to be sealed off from the many harsh hazards of Draenor. You and your Followers have work to do out there if you’re going to deal with the Iron Horde . . . and you’re going to deal with the Iron Horde! Maximizing your effectiveness—and your chances of success—requires a couple of large buildings.<br />
<br />
Large plots can hold the Alliance’s Mage Tower (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/37-mage-tower) or its Horde equivalent, the Spirit Lodge (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/37-mage-tower); the Barracks (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/26-barracks); the Dwarven Bunker (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/8-dwarven-bunker) (Alliance) or War Mill (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/8-dwarven-bunker) (Horde); the Stables (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/65-stables); or the Gnomish Gearworks (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/162-gnomish-gearworks) (Alliance) or Goblin Workshop (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/162-gnomish-gearworks) (Horde).<br />
<br />
This Mage Tower is remarkably powerful. From the moment you build one (or its Horde variant, the Spirit Lodge), you’ll start collecting Ogre Waystones from ogres on Draenor. The building then becomes one end of a system of two-way portals via Ogre Waygates you’ll find in every zone on Draenor. You’ll use the Waystones to activate one gate at a time at building level 1, two at level 2, and three at level 3.<br />
<br />
With the Stables, you can capture and train special mounts on Draenor. These unique mounts spawn all across the world, and after you find and lasso them, you’ll send them to your Garrison for training. The subsequent training quests (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests?filter-search=training&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90) will allow you to add the mounts to your collection, learn the ability to remain mounted while interacting with objects in outdoor Draenor zones (at Stables level 2), and ultimately reward you with an increased mounted speed across Draenor at level 3. Achievements associated with this remarkable building unlock even more mounts, as well as the title Stable Master.<br />
<br />
When you go large, perhaps the Gnomish Gearworks or Goblin Workshop will catch your fancy. It’s a veritable toy store, granting access over the first two levels to unique items such as the Robo-Rooster (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/119158-robo-rooster), Personal Delivery System (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/114246-skyterror-personal-delivery-system), Sentry Turret Dispenser (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/114744-sentry-turret-dispensor), and Micro-Jetpack (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/114244-gg-117-micro-jetpack). Then at building level 3, the real fun begins, as you gain the ability to deploy a siege vehicle to take out for a spin. And by “out,” we mean right out of the Garrison and anywhere on Draenor—yes, that includes Ashran.<br />
<br />
No one ever said it’s going to be easy to choose your buildings!<br />
<br />
While you’ll certainly have the option to tear down a building and replace it with a different one, knowing your options ahead of time will help you better plan your Garrison to reflect your character’s style and needs.<br />
<br />

I was just thinking that. I like Blizzard, but stuff like this just really makes me wonder about them.<br />
<br />
I wish they would provide clarity about things like their overall agenda for crafting and why they decided to weave crafting in so tightly with garrison mechanics, or provide some rational explanation as to why I have to wait until level 96 for the herb garden, but the mine shows up at 92. <br />
<br />
But instead we get this generic overview that just regurgitates really basic information that has been out there for weeks and weeks.</div></div><hr />

For cutting edge PvE players, maybe.<br />
<br />
People interested in PvP will pick different options, as will those who prefer pet battles, mount collecting, leveling alts, transmog, etc, etc....<br />

Pretty far from &quot;cookie cutter&quot;</div></div><hr />

Did you not notice the Gladiator's building which gives you quests to kill members of the opposite faction and earn titles?<br />
<br />
The Garrison is just basically a huge quest hub that people can tailor to their personal style and earn some rewards for doing so.<br />
<br />
It doesn't take the war out of warcraft.</div></div><hr />

IIRC you keep the mounts, even if you get rid of the building. <br />

As far as the profession buildings, they give you extra perks even if you have that profession, such as access to the best recipes.</div></div><hr />

Simple:<br />
<br />
For the pure PVE play, well, the Barracks and Dwarven Bunker (large), Inn (Medium) and Salvage Yard and Storehouse (small) are no-shit-sherlock buildings. You're being told to build one additional small building for your profession, which completes your 3 smalls. So, the only question is: Lumber Mill or Trade Post for the medium. Probably the Lumber Mill, we'll have to see what the trader offers really to compete with the fact that it requires your trade-skill resources.<br />
<br />

<br />
Not entirely but can be played around by viewing it just as a quest hub deal. Once you're done with the introduction stuff you can skip onwards and progress just fine, albeit slower and with some grinds blended in. But I tested and you can, outside of the basic garrison stuff, choose to completely ignore its' existance. It voids you alot of things so doing it is not recommendable but possible.</div></div><hr />

Bliz is all about giving you interesting choices, and skipping Garrison's is not an interesting choice. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really... I will do Mythic raids in WoD and I will not pick Dwarven Bunker for two reasons: it's a free bonus roll, not an extra bonus roll (3 per week limit applies even if you have the Bunker) and also I don't like the mail transmogs.</div></div><hr />

What good are the Barracks or Inn for PvE? Not sure what the reward is for the &quot;Treasure Hunter&quot; missions, but the Barn's Savage Blood for starter epics is surely a must. Barracks seems lackluster I'd rather have the Spirit Lodge to reduce my travel time while doing Garrison missions / level 100 content. I agree with the choice of a War Mill/Bunker since it gives you 1 roll for free and you can gear your followers faster for the raiding mission.<br />
<br />
I'd go with a Trading Post for the auctioneer for even less travel time, and bonus rep gain might come in handy even though I think faction epics are gone...?<br />
<br />
Small is easy indeed, main crafting professions + storehouse + salvage yard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess you could, but:<br />
1. You would have to rebuild it each raid tier when more items get added to the profession.<br />
2. You miss out on getting extra materials (including those that are on a CD to make) to make the items you got with the recipes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suspect Blizzard would tell you that they are optional content, and technically I suppose they are. But I see them as optional in the same way that having air conditioning is optional if you build a house in the desert. You can certainly do it, but...<br />
<br />
They are directly tied to your professions. They are directly tied to quest content in every zone. They are directly tied to methods for getting gear upgrades. They are directly tied to generating sources of income and/or materials. They are directly tied to currencies that can be used to purchase reputation-based gear and items. There are ways to get around most of that, but you'll definitely pay a price for doing it.<br />
<br />
So I see them as one of those things where Blizzard may say players have a free choice, but the reality is that the choice isn't very free at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FALSE: If you have a profession and DON'T have the matching building, you are shut out from the best recipes.<br />
<br />
You can buy them in Ashran. People keep assuming that A way to get a thing is the ONLY way to get a thing.<br />
<br />
The main reason to have a small building that matches your prof is throughput.</div></div><hr />

Small building selection is only easy if you have only one crafting profession. If you have two crafting profession, like the many enchanter/tailors of WoW do, then you have to choose what gets left out, the storehouse, the salvage yard, or one of your two professions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Follower missions generate a good income of useful and fun stuff. At high follower lvl/ilvl, follower missions can give player gear. I plan to start with Barracks/Inn in and build up my team, then switch over to QoL buildings for level-cap content while the boosted follower team reaps rewards for me.<br />

<br />
In this case I go for 2 profession buildings (more soulbound mats for crafts through workorders) and start with Salvage Yard as my third to faster equip my followers so they get to iLvl 645 for the best missions... after most followers are properly equipped then I go for Storehouse (with normal HS to Ashran and garrison HS won't be much of a trouble not to have bank access in my Garrison immediately)</div></div><hr />

It still has potential, but they'll have to iterate on it to make all the choices not be automatic, I think.<br />

I have JC and Inscription on my main, and neither profession is one you want to drop after spending so much time/energy getting recipes.</div></div><hr />

Garrisons really don't sound all bad, but as it stands it looks like alts are almost mandatory if you really want to experience all there is and not have a bad time doing it. That being said I don't think I know a single person at this point who doesn't have at least one respectable alt. <br />
<br />
The only thing that still frustrates me is how the Horde Garrisons are set up like a generic encampment instead of feeling more like a permanent town with strategic value.<br />

So it continues, the more information about garrisons that comes out the less interested and more pissed off I am about their inclusion. I just don't want to do them. GOD I'M SO PISSED. Don't do them, nobody cares, on your way to 100 just treat it like any other quest objective.</div></div><hr />

Is there really any reason to have 2 crafting professions in WoD with the removal of char only buffs with everything else being tradeable?</div></div><hr />

Meh, tailor/enchanter. I have everything else on my other toons already. Including a miner/skinner and skinner/herbalist. Not sure what I'll do with those.</div></div><hr />

I sure hope so. So far all I've ever got from them is garrison materials and crappy greens. Woooooo.<br />
<br />
All told, I'd rather run dungeons/LFR for loot than click a follower and wait 10 hours.</div></div><hr />

Thats sort of the point though. Follower missions are entirely in the back ground. You just visit your table once in a while, clear out the finished missions, send out a few new ones, then go back about your day. No involvement on your part past the initial click.<br />
<br />
And most missions (at least on the beta) are in the ~1 hour range. While leveling you get a mission-table in each zone, so its relatively easy to stop in and get the missions moving while handing in quests, without having to back track all the way to the garrison itself. Just leave the 10+ hour missions until youre logging off for the night and reap the reward the next day.<br />
<br />
Sure the rewards are mostly pointless, but its non-zero, and involves so little work that I cant see why one wouldnt bother with it, at least occasionally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I imagine this whole choice system will eventually be just like the talent system. There will be fun ways to do things that you can customize but there will always be the BEST way to do things. I just feel like so much effort has been poured into this little system and I'll reserve my judgment but I don't have high hopes for the long-term life of this feature. <br />
<br />
I guess things would be different if I knew what it was like on Beta, but it's kind of seeming like an elaborate Farmville/Command and Conquer interface mini-game or something. I don't know. Do you get to see your followers in the Garrison? If you give them upgraded gear, do you get to see their appearance change with them equipping the gear? Do you see anything they do aside from the random attacks on your base every now and then? Is the AI anything more than them knowing when to heal themselves and when to shield bash, waving, and doing a conga line?</div></div><hr />

Don't think that anything benefits raiding that much. Even the one that gives you one wod-version-of-warforged-seals, since these can be obtained easilly with other means.</div></div><hr />

I have the opposite problem - I'm neither undead nor a rogue, meanwhile I'd rather get a small dent in my car than deal with PVP.</div></div><hr />
