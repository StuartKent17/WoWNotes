7.0.3 Launch Tuning Hotfixes<br />
Greetings. Over the last day or two, we've applied a multitude of changes for tuning prior to 7.0.3 launch. Usually during betas, the community largely determines changes through datamining and comparing what changed between builds. But with hotfixes, that's much harder. Once we launch, we'll follow our normal procedures of posting hotfix notes, but for this last round of tuning before launch, I've listed what changed below.<br />
<br />
Note that this is the tuning we're doing for 7.0.3 launch, but we will of course adjust after launch if needed. The goal is for all classes and specs to be viable, so if any prove not to be, rest assured that we will continue iterating.<br />

Theorycrafting Questions<br />
Does a 1sec Renewing Mist partial-tick have half the chance to proc Uplifting Trance as a 2sec full tick (i.e. proc chance scales with tick duration), or are the proc chances equal?<br />
Currently has a full chance to proc. Not likely to be an issue, but if it becomes one (i.e. haste breakpoints start to matter), we can prorate the proc chance on a partial tick.<br />
<br />
Off the top of my head, the only periodic I can think of where we currently do this is Doom.<br />
Will we go live with the 750ms GCD floor or was that changed again in the meantime?<br />
That's still in place.<br />
<br />
Backdraft, Destruction Warlock first tier Talent. If I wear no gear, the duration of the Buff is 5 seconds as statted in the tooltip. However, if I wear some haste, the duration is decreased (e.g. the Duration scales with haste). Is this intended?<br />
It is--the rhythm of how you use the talent (knowing that, say, after a Conflag, you can cast 3 hasted Incinerates) should remain the same regardless of your gear level.

Isn't it better than the changes are applied to the patch before it comes out? I mean what's your point here; that pre-expansion patches go through iterations, and that's a bad thing? That's how tuning works dude. That's why we have the PTR, is it not?</div></div><hr />

They are indeed implementing Demon Hunters on the 19th, but they will not be activated so doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />

Well that wasn't exactly a complaint. I just mean... look at the scope of the changes that are happening with Legion. Simply put there's a shitload. Which means there's a lot to tune, and once it gets into the hands of the general public it will be chaos. I just find it amusing they're starting so early. Frankly I don't expect the game to be remotely close to tuned at any level until 7.1</div></div><hr />

They should move the guys who designed Crusader for D3 over - the class is a meat sheild with a bottle of holy water and a big stick, but it's fun to play.<br />

Frankly I don't expect the game to be remotely close to tuned at any level until 7.1<br />
<br />
I'd predict 7.2, possibly 7.3. They really never stop tweaking, ever, and this is just going to be a rollercoaster for a while. Sometime around patch 7.1 dropping, Ion will do an interview and talk about how &quot;We got too aggresive with the initial changes, and we need to be better&quot;, to justify more turmoil and instability in the game. <br />
<br />
PvP looks to be a shitstorm, too.</div></div><hr />

I thought they were playable during 7.0 for anyone who pre-ordered.<br />
<br />
Guess its time for you to read the last couple MMO-C posts with all those details.</div></div><hr />

It is already in need of BUFFING as the weakest talent choice out of an already lackluster 100 talent selection now a 33% nerf to it's already pathetic damage boost? Just fucking remove it, then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well you're probably right that it won't be &quot;tuned&quot; til 7.1, but they're not &quot;starting early&quot;, they're carrying on tuning from beta, like they've been doing the whole beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kill Command interrupts any other animation, teleports your bow / gun on your back and your character does his retarded hand movement. Looks the worst on orcs. Every other skill is pretty much the same as before. I like the gameplay, but god damn, the animations are just disgusting to look at. It's a shame for them to have this quality when melee has such great animations now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. The artifact still won't be available until Legion. During the pre-patch you will be able to do the broken shores event that sets things in motion and the demon invasions (whenever they activate them) but that's it. The artifact quest line only becomes available once the broken shores questline ends. Not giving away spoilers but when you finish the Broken Shores stuff, you end up in &quot;X&quot;, at this point while you are in &quot;X&quot; an NPC will randomly run up to you to start the artifact weapon questline.<br />
<br />
The major features such as xmog wardrobes, class changes, glyph changes, new UI elements, etc will all be available tomorrow. DH will be available no later than 8/17 according to Blizz for the pre-orderers, and the demon invasions won't be starting for a few weeks from tomorrow. They want people to get a feel for the class changes before activating everything else in the pre-patch (or so they said in one of the Q&amp;A Twitch streams they are doing). Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Okay, I'm just confused because I see other people responding saying they are going to get X gold trait during the pre-patch and it threw me off</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, they are trolling or just wrong. It also doesn't help that they tuning post mentioned the tank artifacts which likely threw some people off. You can look at THIS POST (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/20176410/the-legion-pre-expansion-patch-arrives-july-19-7-15-2016) from Blizz and THIS POST (http://www.wowhead.com/news=253553/guide-to-whats-coming-in-the-legion-pre-expansion-and-ptr-patch-notes) for proof. The second post lists everything that is coming, including a section at the bottom for what is not coming in the pre-patch and instead held out until launch. If that has changed then I would be shocked and I surely haven't heard about it yet. Wouldn't make sense as unlocking your artifact also requires you to unlock your Order Hall, which isn't being released until Legion's actual launch.</div></div><hr />
