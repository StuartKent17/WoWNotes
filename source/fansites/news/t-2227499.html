Patch 7.2.5 - Shoe-Shine Kit<br />
Patch 7.2.5 fixes the previously unavailable Shoe Shine Kit (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/129055-shoe-shine-kit) toy. At midnight PST Sheddle Glossgleam (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/97003-sheddle-glossgleam) will leave his regular spot and heads down to the Legerdemain Lounge to drink. A chest will spawn that allows one player (or potentially several that are there right away, similar to other shared objects) to loot the toy. Thanks to Nightswifty, minorpains, and the Secret Finding Discord for figuring this out!<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Is wpvp considered a &quot;non-pvp&quot; situation for this????<br />
No. Situations that activate Honor Talents will also enable Concordance's PvP tuning. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/867445986959818752))<br />
<br />
Can you confirm that Cutting Edge: Mythic Gul'dan will be removed once 7.2.5 is released?<br />
Cutting Edge and Ahead of the Curve for Gul'dan will become unavailable once the Tomb of Sargeras raid unlocks. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/867475639971885056))<br />

<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Reading your last question got me thinking, why is gaming industry so secretive? I mean not talking about future plans for games etc is obvious since it’s just the way business is, like with movies, you’re not supposed to know sequel to X is coming until it is officially announced. But i mean from inside point of things like how things are created etc. Is it because of competition in technology? entitlement? not wanting to wider up small industry to possibly newcomers that are competition?<br />
It is almost always about trying to manage player expectations.<br />
<br />
I’ll use new champions as an example. If I casually talk about a new champion we are working on months in advance, then here are a bunch of bad things that could happen. This isn’t just speculation, because these things usually do happen when something leaks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Players might get impatient and then finally bored by the time something ships. It becomes “Well, finally, Jeez” instead of excitement.<br />
Related, teases and hype videos (think of the “egg” one we did for Xayah and Rakkan) are pointless because everyone knows they are coming.<br />
Players talk a lot about designs for which they have no details, and sometimes convince themselves that certain things must be true, and then are disappointed when that is not the case. (You see this factor a lot in modern TV shows, when fans spend 100X more time discussing an episode than the actual length of the episode and come up with these labyrinthine explanations or predictions that very often do not pan out).<br />
Players get exposed to temporary, test or bad ideas, and then get disappointed if those get pulled. We still get requests for champions that we killed long ago because some players got excited about them. (See also: Magma Chamber, Abyssal Maw raid, etc.)<br />
Players draw conclusions based on hacked-in, temporary or test functionality or art. Devs get very leery about showing work-in-progress because players compare it to finished, live content and find the WIP wanting. It’s really easy for the developers to lose control of the message because the community has already formed conclusions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, some studios or devs are really paranoid about competitors stealing their idea, but honestly that’s so hard to do in this business that we should all just stop worrying about it. Developing a new feature takes a lot of time and if you rush it to beat someone to market, you very well might end up with a crappy feature. There are definitely some benefits to being the first game in a particular genre (and I know this has benefited League a bunch in some countries), but you can’t forsake everything to be first. Players are more likely to play the second game than a bad game.<br />
<br />
Players used to ask if we launched a WoW patch on a particular day in order to compete with a big announcement from some other studio. Alas, if only this industry was that agile. Big launches are cemented months in advance and only slip if catastrophe would ensue sans delay.<br />
<br />
Good question. (Source (https://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/159772612403/reading-your-last-question-got-me-thinking-why))<br />

<br />
When Blizzard shows conceptual designs or &quot;In progress&quot; designs and people work themselves up into a gigantic frenzy when ideas are removed or changed during the design process.<br />
<br />
It's a double-edged sword for Devs since they are constantly yelled at by players to show more of whats being work on or conceptual designs happening behind the scenes, yet if they do and things change in the developmental cycle people lose their shit and try to make it seem like conceptual designs were somehow promises of exact content.<br />

I've got it on my main and one of its alt weapons, almost both weapons now, and my alt is nearly there and it was just leveled two days ago. I don't play much, it's just about being efficient with your time. Spam portals with the Nether up, have a speed champion or two for the Command Center AP quest and do all the AP world quests in between mythic+. Having a good raid also means Nighthold AP is super quick. It's hard not to stumble into Concordance now.</div></div><hr />

Yea, the majority of my AP only comes from Emmisaries every three days and raiding now basically (though 74 mil off the table today was nice :P) and I still have it coming in in droves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
About the AP, after doing the same farming content each day, i mean all WQ and 1 heroday, i earn like around 20% of the bar. This has never changed despites the evolution of AK. In the future when we will reached AK 40, that % gonna keep going down and down. I think under 10% each day it gonna be a waste. At this moment i think it will be time to equalize all your other spec.</div></div><hr />

He is missing something in his statement, something very important. something that could obliterate his listener even more: AK is not just a catch up mechanic, it's also a gating mechanic to invalidate your time on irregular schedules even more. The only reason why AP requirements even increased was so that they could drag concordance out for 12 weeks for the majority..<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm getting concordance on my 3rd weapon (tank) this week. Then AP grinding can fuck off and with it 90% of the &quot;world content&quot;. I will only do emissary and boring shore shit for legendaries, seeing how the new ring will be nice for unholy and the chest for frost seems to be interesting as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first point in Concordance, correct; sorry for being fuzzy in my meaning in that part of my post. Blizzard has said that it is their intention that the cap is not you-must-do-this-if-you-raid but that the player has something to sink Artifact Power into so AP and Artifact Knowledge continue to still provide some reward.<br />
<br />
I have not been a raider in years, and not a serious raider in several more. I do not have any feeling of must-get-this-done-ASAP or even complete-for-completion's-sake. So, once I have that point in Concordance so it isn't greyed out in my artifact weapon's sheet, then it is done (for me). Hence, &quot;meh.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am super casual, only do WQs and play mostly to support my AH endeavours but reached Concordance on my main and have 2 alts which are at 48 each. I don't even play Mythic+ and purchase a boost run through Heroic NH and PUG Normal NH likewise every 2 weeks when I have a day off.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard found a very sweet spot with the AP / AK / Concordance -like if I can get it, then I presumed mostly everyone who Raids would have it. <br />
<br />
I have always kept my Followers / Hall / AK up to speed and usually do my Daily / Weekly and a few (far from all!) Emissaries a week but have only started M+ again last week after a break since EN was released... that's my experience, and without a Guild (another story) since EN, I just play for fun and Gold / Pets now.<br />
<br />
I think the general TLDR is that everyone who needs Concordance has it, and by that benchmark I'd say Blizzard made it a success.</div></div><hr />

I get you. We're raiding once a week, but somehow I still try to keep up with AP to stand out in the group as much as possible. I hate the grind, so I limit myself to just getting the fatest WQs and not even bother about the &quot;do 4 quests, get a chest&quot; anymore (except if it's by chance in the same area).<br />
Anyways, I'm at the 4000-4300. Just remember, each new point is 300 more, so 300x49=14,700 ability boost (e.g. Dex).<br />

I am sure, that was sarcasm, but quite dont see it... if AK 40 stays and wont be upgrades to 50, we will most likely get to 17-20 of concordance with much farming and all the time until 8.0 hits... maxing the weapon to 50 is no option.</div></div><hr />

WoW has released patch 5.3 a few days earlier then the Wildstar early access launch, Hellfire Citadel for when FFXIV released Heavensward, and now they're releasing Tomb of Sargeras when FFXIV releases Stormblood. This is adjusted to compete with a big announcement from some other studio.</div></div><hr />
