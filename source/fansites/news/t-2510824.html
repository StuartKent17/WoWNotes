That's called diplomacy.

Even so, this would be cinematic #3 where she's used the smokey Banshee stuff. I imagine she's empowered by Xalatath or Nzoth as they even state she's getting stronger every day. I dunno... the Mak'gora, I expected more from. Like, I honestly didn't think they would pull a Gul'dan from the movie. I don't know... I'm not super critical of stuff like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Garithos? Kind of.<br />
Camp Taurajo? Blame quillboars, Alliance actually let civilians go.<br />
Internment camps? As opposed to total genocide of orcs?<br />
Purge of Dalaran was Jaina's mistake, but Sunreavers really were working with Garrosh behind Council's back.</div></div><hr />

I just like things making sense and for characters to act in a somewhat consistent manner.<br />
<br />
Nothing that happened makes any sense plot wise. Hell lore wise sylvanas died by doing a belly first power slide into frostmourne but now shes a expert hand to hand fighter dispite never using anything but a bow and weird ghost powers?<br />

So, the speculations might come true, some fused faction. This would explain why your characters in the log in screen now also show the Alliance and Horde symbole. We might be able to expect to choose our faction in the future, which might be weird tbh.<br />

Sylvanas might start to represent another, smaller faction in the future.</div></div><hr />

8.3 is confirmed, and this questline confirms N'zoth is the final boss. They literally say after you finish that we must now turn our attention to N'zoth and should we succeed, we will then deal with Sylvanas (the next expansion baddie for sure)</div></div><hr />

Splitting your playerbase in 2 never made sense from a design standpoint.<br />
<br />
What are you talking about...never made sense from a design standpoint...it was at the very core of the entire Warcraft and Wow franchise...it motivated people to become highly invested in both their characters and faction..it powered several expansion's worth of content...it generated massive amounts of world pvp at a time when there was limited content in the original game...people say Vanilla wouldn't succeed if it was introduced today...you know what would never have succeeded either...the watered down, faction-less hamster wheel that Retail currently is if was introduced back in 2005...without the faction war WoW would never have become as popular as it did.<br />
<br />
You know why their considering removing it...it's mostly because the player base has declined so much they don't have the in-game metrics that head office wants to justify the development time on separate alliance / horde story lines / quests etc. Additionally, with having relented previously and given both faction every type of class they've diluted their own faction identity so much that it leads to people like you saying it never made design sense to begin with. This is a classic case of Blizzard giving an inch that gradually leads to a mile. I also assume they think it will be easier to balance in some way in regards to pvp (no more alliance / horde racial or something like that).<br />
<br />
And here's another thing you can count on. If they get rid of the factions they'll come up with some BS line about why it no longer makes sense and the fanboys will cling to that and forever repeat it just like the BS line they came up with when they said the old talent trees weren't worth it because adding 1% hit didn't feel meaningful etc. That, of course, was just corporate BS for we don't want to work so hard and can't figure out how to balance classes as is, let alone with more lvls, so we'll bake all that stuff into the character and add one talent every 15 levels and call it a day because that should require a lot less work and be easier to balance (though it should be noted they still can't balance crap).

No more faction war. Wohoo!<br />
Finally we can now get some more interesting stories that aren't the same faction conflict every other expansion.<br />

Question with BFA remains, is Sylvanas with N'zoth or with death itself? Plot thickens.<br />
Her path is just beginning now that she's free of the stupid war conflict.<br />
As long as it's not yet again another redemption story.<br />
Or we just kill her off in the last raid, death might not be the answer.<br />

<br />
I like how Saurfang knew he could not win, and so his whole strategy was to bait Sylvanas into making a mistake. He won the moment she said she did not care about the horde. This was a nice way to end this storyline, which I feared was just going to end in the Siege of Orgrimmar 2.0. <br />
<br />
i feel like the Sylvannas loyalist in game cinematic also helps illuminate her position and sets her up to be the herald of Death (which means, maybe, the 9.0 leak that happened is actually real...). <br />

I'm sure that motivated some people. WoW is a PvE game at it's core, and that is why me and most people are here. Dividing a PvE playerbase in half never made any sense. <br />

The siege was real. Everyone was prepared to fight a war. Saurfang wanted to prevent casualties and challenged Sylvanas. <br />
<br />
She ran off because she fucked up. When she revealed her true feelings by saying &quot;The Horde is nothing!&quot; the forsaken accompanying her side-eyed her and she realized she fucked up. So she basically yolo'd the situation and just let everyone know that she sees all of them as puppets and they mean nothing. <br />
All the horde that was still following her would probably not follow her anymore and she would have no chance against the entire horde and alliance combined, so she ran.

Gonna snip that pointless wall-o-text and point out that in the book published by one of the original WoW devs, having two warring player mega-factions was actually an afterthought, added relatively late to the game.<br />
<br />
The original idea for factions were all pvp centric around the battlegrounds.<br />

<br />
I don't think there is a new warchief from what I've gathered. Probably Thrall? <br />
<br />
Sylvanas ran off to her old home in the Ghostlands and Nathanos and the loyalist player followed her. She reveals some of her plans to the player while Nathanos walks away still following her plans. Both the Horde and the Forsaken are without a leader right now it seems. Jaina talks with Calia about helping out the other forsaken but it's vague<br />
<br />
Edit: sorry I forgot about the other question. Yes basically that's what happened, she slipped and you can actually see the exact moment she realizes she just lost the duel/the horde's loyalty even if she succeeded in killing Saurfang.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sylvanas isnt serving Nzoth or Azshra, she is just using them to win more souls for the army of the Death. The game been plotting a clash between Void and Death. <br />
She didnt care about the war she just want more souls. Hell you even have a part on this helping Bwonsamdi, you are a playing promise him a 1000 souls, and when he lost Voljin soul he was crazy worry.<br />
I mean really alot of this ppl negative comments are just from ppl that dont fallow the lore at all. <br />
Is more on the side on the alliance Calia conversation between Jaina and her brother, is setting her as a hope for Undeath, since Sylvanas is just working with a new force we dont know yet, hell even you get a line about this after the fight with Sourfang, where they speak about her using a new magic that no one cant detect, and if it was void magic they could have notice that, so is easy to see that she isnt working with Nzoth, just using him.<br />
<br />

<br />
She ran off because she fucked up. When she revealed her true feelings by saying &quot;The Horde is nothing!&quot; the forsaken accompanying her side-eyed her and she realized she fucked up. So she basically yolo'd the situation and just let everyone know that she sees all of them as puppets and they mean nothing. <br />
All the horde that was still following her would probably not follow her anymore and she would have no chance against the entire horde and alliance combined, so she ran. The loyalists accepted the rebels and now everyone is on the same side (even the forsaken) so she opened the Orgrimmar gates for Thrall and Anduin.<br />
<br />
In reality for her Horde or Alliance mean nothing, all the living mean nothing, she knows the Void (and maybe the Light) are the true enemy, so she care only about souls for the Army of the Death. <br />
<br />
That why she run her plan like you can read on the loyalty quest, have work, she have ALOT of souls from the War.<br />

I mean... Just to pull the closes thing to what sylvanas is. We do blame all the natzis in world war 2 for the acts of what Hitler did as a leader.. At the time no one went like&quot; yea, but can we really blame all the soldiers for the acts of what the leader did?&quot; yes we could.<br />
it 100% blame free card. Ones more the alliance gets hit with a war Crime, this time Genocide of the elves and a world tree, and the rest of the hordes(even all the horde who faithfully Did it all) can go like&quot; oh yea we totaly did nothing wrong&quot;</div></div><hr />

did you play the quest??? isnt over, Tyrant didnt show up and Alduin said she is consume by hate, same goes for Gwen, he still hate horde. <br />
<br />
But still you cant blame the whole horde by the action of their Warchieft, they dont have a said on the meter, if they do they get to jail or banish, and they Horde move on Honor so getting banish is a terrible insult. Hell you can see that on Sourfang story arc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A product of his own making; he defeated Ner'zhul and overtook control as the Lich King, but Arthas was the maker of his own power-hungry destiny. <br />
<br />
Arthas went fanatically crazy trying to save his people. Killed a bunch of innocents to stop the plague in Stratholme. Through his own vainglory and fanaticism he willingly picked up Frostmourne after being warned of the curse by Muradin.<br />
<br />
To say he was an Orc in a shell is a bit disingenuous.</div></div><hr />

If you blame all the Nazi you are just wrong, since there were multiple faction that work against Hitler, hell they make a movie about it, actually 2 movies. <br />

GW2 style possibly, release a version that takes place 100-200 years in the future. Just not as time travel convoluted BS. It doesn't even have to be a completely new game. Just end the current storyline, start a new one. A lot of issues with writing right now is because they're forced to recycle the same characters, same setting, same world without changes but instad pile more zones that will be abandoned in the next xpac. Not to mention the player character itself that's basically should be practically a god at that point.<br />
<br />
But that's not going to happen of course because it's World of Vanitycraft now. Too many players will not be able to part with their precious pets, mounts and transmogs to start anew.</div></div><hr />

After WoD, nothing surprises me really. This type of convoluted storytelling is just pure insanity.

is been like that for a while. <br />
Helya deal was on Legion. Kind of screen.<br />

Azshara deal you find out if you are a loyalist with her. you get a quest after the war campaign.<br />

Heey, did you read the after-cinematics dialogue? It's migraine-inducing, really.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rilgiz: You got two seocnds to scram. We ain't holdin' nothing' for the mooks who stood with Sylvanas.<br />
Former Banshee Loyalist: I keep telling you, my loyalty is to the Horde. I didn't know she was using us, I wanted to believe in her!<br />
Rilgiz: Don't matter to me. Take your junk and get outta here. You ain't part of MY Horde!<br />
Baine Bloodhoof: What's happening here?<br />
Rilgiz: This Sylvanas-supporting scum is tryin' to use our bank. This here's for HORDE only!<br />
Baine Bloodhoof: I will not tolerate such talk! Many were led astray by Sylvanas's lies.<br />
Baine Bloodhoof: We must now come together as a united Horde. Those who seek forgiveness are forgiven.<br />
Baine Bloodhoof: They have sworn an oath of loyalty to the Horde. They should be allowed to use your services.<br />
Rilgiz: Fine, fine! I'll take whatever you wanna deposit. What is it?<br />
<br />
You know, they've just been fucking led astray by sylvanas lies! That excuses it all! And they are truly remorseful, not just trying to save their hides when their leader had forsaken (lul) them all.</div></div><hr />

This actually comfirm the Shadowland leak lol, WTF you speaking about. <br />
<br />
Hell even Sylvanas claim she dont care about anything only more souls from the war, and even Nzoth will be sacrifice to Death. So the leak about a ARMY OF DEATH ATTACKING SW make more sence now, since you look the lead, they are all &quot;gosh&quot; death. So she will control a huge army of death. <br />
<br />
Sylvanas is serving a new death force that we dont know yet, same as the one Bwonsandi claim to serve.</div></div><hr />

Wat? Past 5th grade level, clarifications usually are given to statements like this. <br />
<br />
How is this story is not convoluted? Before the Storm made perfect sense to stage to conflict. The in-game is filled with actions and motivations that make no sense and recycle an old story from WoD. <br />
How do people still follow Sylvanas, knowing well what happened last time the Horde attempted the exact same thing they did this expansion. <br />
How do people still follow Anduin, considering that he literally refuses to fight the enemy that slaughter alliance in scores? <br />
<br />
And of course, they had to bring green Jesus back, which did nothing at all. <br />
Zandalari we somehow defeated completely, while Kul'tiras apparently does nothing at the moment. They're just there ... <br />
The &quot;speaker of Atheroth&quot; still follows with this even though everyone knows that was a plot from N'Zoth from the very start. Yet he still rolls with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sylvanas won, but saying &quot;the Horde is nothing&quot; didn't play well with the midwestern voter base. So she decided to take her talents to Miami.<br />
<br />
<br />
She could be flying off to blow up Stormwind or something, but then the war campaign wouldn't be &quot;over&quot; like Blizzard claimed.<br />

<br />
bc as the story ongoing on the game is setting Sylvanas dont care about the horde or the Alliance or anything, she just care about Death.<br />
<br />
Death is a enemy of the Void, as it was set on the Sister Comic. And as you see from the loyalty quest ending, she only care about the soul farm on the war, and she plotting with Azshra and Nzoth is just to get more souls, and them she even plan on sacrifice Nzoth to the Death. <br />
<br />
Bwonsanbi speak about this too, when you try to find Voljin soul, and he is worrie that his boss find out he lose a soul. <br />
<br />
Sylvanas run bc she is plotting a bigger game that just who control Ogrimar or the Horde. 2</div></div><hr />

Hell even Sylvanas claim she dont care about anything only more souls from the war, and even Nzoth will be sacrifice to Death. So the leak about a ARMY OF DEATH ATTACKING SW make more sence now, since you look the lead, they are all &quot;gosh&quot; death. So she will control a huge army of death. <br />

Sylvanas is serving a new death force that we dont know yet, same as the one Bwonsandi claim to serve.<br />

What been disappointed. Everything on the story is point to a clash between Void and Death. <br />
<br />
I got 0 surprise from what happen today, since everything was point to this, only surprise for me was the duel beteewn her and Surfang and his death, outside that i was thinking that when we storm Orgrimar she was already gone.<br />
<br />
She been speaking about farming souls already and for her a big prize is SW since is a major city left on the alliance, since she already destroy Nelf city, and IF isnt as populate as SW. So destroy SW will give her ALOT of souls.<br />

Further, Arthas created Sylvanas in her current form and is responsible for her actions as well.<br />
Ehh I don’t know. Sure he raised her as a banshee but everything she’s done is her own free will. That’s the whole point of the Forsaken, undead free of the Lich King and struggling with what to do after their free will was returned to them.

After rewatching I caught the sequence of events better. He says Horde is x, and y, an zeee! She says Horde is nothing then her standard bearer starts giving her a side-eye and it sinks in she might as well go hard on her exit.

My first view I was too busy hoping she'd win and there wouldn't be some cheesy twist so he'd beat her. I was checking to see if the cut was one of those eyebrow things that don't actually go deep or if the body she'd been using was ruined and she had to find a new form.</div></div><hr />

World of Warcraft is World of Warcraft. You're getting this mixed up with the RTS Warcraft: Orcs vs Humans. Which as an argument is rather pointless, because you could also call it World of Warcraft Tides of Darkness or World of Warcraft Frozen Throne if you go by that criteria.</div></div><hr />

Then they pretend &quot;the spirits&quot; chose her as warchief and they elaborate her as someone who can motivate the horde, who lost another leader... then they go 179°, make her a &quot;KILL MAIM KILL&quot;-Chaoswith with no cares given, shrugging the Chosen One Arc off as dark god manipulation and pretty much letting her kick puppies and deny the holocaust just to have an villain. And on the other side they turn every other Horde-Character into a bland &quot;qq, why not be friends?&quot;-bitch... I dont want to play a Horde full of Anduin bootlickers... I want to kill that bland one-dimensional shounen protagonist.<br />
<br />
I really hope they're going somewhere with the Loyalty-Questline, because siding with Helya and now Azshara to subvert N'zoth and help Sylvanas become an Avatar of Death to defeat the Void sounds 100.000.000 more kickass... than this for azeroth and fight them with friendship bullshit they were pulling for 15years now.<br />

<br />
Sylvanas isnt serving Nzoth or Azshra, she is just using them to win more souls for the army of the Death. The game been plotting a clash between Void and Death. <br />
She didnt care about the war she just want more souls. Hell you even have a part on this helping Bwonsamdi, you are a playing promise him a 1000 souls, and when he lost Voljin soul he was crazy worry.<br />
I mean really alot of this ppl negative comments are just from ppl that dont fallow the lore at all. <br />
Is more on the side on the alliance Calia conversation between Jaina and her brother, is setting her as a hope for Undeath, since Sylvanas is just working with a new force we dont know yet, hell even you get a line about this after the fight with Sourfang, where they speak about her using a new magic that no one cant detect, and if it was void magic they could have notice that, so is easy to see that she isnt working with Nzoth, just using him.<br />
<br />
I dont know why you all get disappoint is about the way the game lore is going when they been setting this for a long time.<br />
<br />
Or, in other words, it's bad and predictable writing without any nuance or surprise? That's why people are bitching, my dude.</div></div><hr />

This is the most ridiculous thing I've seen.<br />
<br />
That's what the series was based on yes, doesn't mean it can't evolve and change over time.<br />
<br />
I'm not condoning this level of writing, just saying it doesn't have to stay as Horde vs Alliance forever and ever until the end of time, I hope it doesn't devolve into this shit again.... either join forces or kill each other, no more of this flip flopping because they need some ridiculous excuse to start a new expansion. After the Legion Order Halls essentially transcended any faction with the cooperation of the orders greatest heroes across both sides, it made little sense for us to go back to the factions being at each other's throats again and have the player character who was the leader of those orders go back to being a faction leader lap dog.<br />
<br />
I agree that the story is ridiculous, but IMO it's the faction's fighting each other at this point that makes it so, not the extra stuff. The story has evolved past it, multiple times over the last few expansions...it's time to move on.</div></div><hr />

Legitimately everyone involved in writing this should be fired. It's like they're intentionally trying to ruin every character and faction. I mean I went into this expecting sylvanas to be ruined as well as saurfang but I didn't expect them to find a way to destroy the forsaken as well. The forsaken never gave a shit about the horde and now they're so put off by hearing sylvanas bad mouth it that they surrender the war? What? Aren't they under sylvanas' control anyway and weren't they always planning on using and betraying the horde? It even says that shit in the opening crawl of the undead starting zone in classic. The story makes less sense than ever now and this was the point where we were finally supposed to have answers...Turns out the answer is just, &quot;Yup, everyone is a moron and nothing matters.&quot; What a disaster.<br />
<br />
They even screw up on stupid little things with concepts brought up in this very video like home being azeroth so all the races should work together (which makes no sense at all) and then they're like, &quot;Oh let's bring saurfang's body home&quot;....Oh, I guess home IS orgrimmar then.</div></div><hr />

Helya deal was on Legion. Kind of screen.<br />
<br />
Azshara deal you find out if you are a loyalist with her. you get a quest after the war campaign.<br />
<br />
The whole Death vs Void, you get a part on the Sister comic.<br />
<br />
That's the thing i have 100% sided with sylvanas i heard nothing about her actually making some sort of deal with Azshara<br />
<br />
unless that quest comes in in 8.2.5 cause all Nathanos said was your loyalties will be truly tested next time but that was ages ago<br />
did i some how miss it? i support her regardless cause it just seems more fun from a game play stand point.<br />
But i wish they would just tell me what the hell is going on cause if they keep holding off the payoff will never meet expectations.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I also had to watch it twice to understand it completely. I think they did an amazing job animating her expressions, the music that stops right after her words to convey the surprise of the standard bearer and possibly the whole army of loyalists. I loved it because we got a glimpse of her vulnerable/hurting side and said something irrational/unplanned, just like when she lost her composure and ordered to burn Teldrassil on a whim<br />

These cinematics were great, good ending to Saurfang. He died achieving the goal of making the biggest step toward peace. <br />
<br />
Hopefully the musical chairs of Warchief is finally over and Thrall takes the spot back, hopefully Anduin doesn’t become the High WarKing or something either.</div></div><hr />

But that would follow the Garrosh pattern perfectly. The circle is almost complete. <br />
Maybe she's going to open a portal to a death realm, like parallel Atheroth where souls of the dead reside or something, and travel there! Then try to attack Atheroth with an army she forms in that death realm! And then we have to follow her though the portal! <br />
<br />
I mean really. This story, plus if shadowlands leaks are true, makes this the only logical path to follow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats the whole point: It was NOT the action of the warchief. It where the actions of the horde. They are not getting blamed for the things THEY did. Sylvanas did not burn Teldrassil, the horde did. Sylvanas did not slaughter villagers and farmers in Stormsong, the horde did.</div></div><hr />

Then they pretend &quot;the spirits&quot; chose her as warchief and they elaborate her as someone who can motivate the horde, who lost another leader... then they go 179°, make her a &quot;KILL MAIM KILL&quot;-Chaoswith with no cares given, shrugging the Chosen One Arc off as dark god manipulation and pretty much letting her kick puppies and deny the holocaust just to have an villain. And on the other side they turn every other Horde-Character into a bland &quot;qq, why not be friends?&quot;-bitch... I dont want to play a Horde full of Anduin bootlickers... I want to kill that bland one-dimensional shounen protagonist.<br />
<br />
I really hope they're going somewhere with the Loyalty-Questline, because siding with Helya and now Azshara to subvert N'zoth and help Sylvanas become an Avatar of Death to defeat the Void sounds 100.000.000 more kickass... than this for azeroth and fight them with friendship bullshit they were pulling for 15years now.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I consider that Thunderbluff must be destroyed<br />
<br />
<br />
Nah, what needed to happen is Sylvanas needs to die. Tired of massive plot armor, crazy amounts of random power even though the lich king is significantly more powerful than her. She should have died. I am tired of having pointless conflicts that lead to nothing, time to make the PC’s the actual hero’s and just stop with these NPC’s Consorting and influencing us, the PC’s who are realistically some of the most powerful beings ever is tiresome and stupid this late in the game.</div></div><hr />

I wish more people would have paid attention to this. Sylvanas has never been &quot;morally grey&quot;, she's Arthas without Ner'zhul's crown. The Forsaken were her puppets to seek vengeance on Arthas like the Scourge were Arthas' puppets to destroy the world. She cared only about that goal, and since that point, she's cared only for herself and staving off the eternal torment she faces at her final death. <br />
<br />
Sylvanas is no less evil than Azshara. She demands and receives the love of her people and uses it for her own aggrandizement and power.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Ok this is totally Garrosh 2.0.&quot;<br />
<br />
Let's not forget alliance and horde unite to beat the villain. That video and story would have been interesting like 7 years ago(okay, plot holes would still be plot holes)...but right now it feels like utter cheese. They tried hard to to create a heroic death for Saurfang...but unlike with Arthas they try way too hard and it makes too little sense. Why should Sylvanas suddenly freak out that close to victory? Why should she stop with just taking out Saurfang and not kill Thrall and Anduin along the way(it's not like her reputation still matters and she needs to play by the rules)? And everyone knows right away what Sylvanas words mean and is willing to back down from war? I mean, really? To call that all very 1 dimensional would still give it too much credit. That's stuff you can feed to elementary school kids...but the Warcraft community already grew up with the franchise for 15-20 years....so they are a bit old for that kind of very simple story.</div></div><hr />

Most likely 8.3 will be centered around the theme of the next expansion. Just because the war campaign is over doesn't mean there's nothing new coming before 9.0.<br />

Just because the war campaign is over doesn't mean there's nothing new coming before 9.0.<br />
<br />
Well that's really underwhelming storytelling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Next expansion we will find Saurfang taking a shower under a waterfall and notice that it was all just a bad dream. Did such a plot line ever happen anywhere before? Well, who cares...recycling is &quot;in&quot;. :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
It actually ends with her learning magic and turning to smoke or something? Just wtf...<br />
Banshee.<br />
<br />
And about the cinematics... okay... now what?</div></div><hr />

Sylvanas lost twice in that fight, though she could have actually won and had everything. Her temper got the better of her. &quot;The Horde is nothing!&quot; got her in trouble, but she could have gotten through that. The fact that she used magic to blast Saurfang violated the ceremony of Mok'gora. None but the Forsaken would have possibly followed her after that. Even the most bloodthirsty of the orcs would have turned away from her with the way she violated that sacrament.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you know that's not true.<br />
<br />
Why do you have such an urge for everyone else to share your views and opinions, and why are you unable to accept that some people think differently? Why do you want to try to spread negativity on a game - hell, why are you even on these forums and play the game if you think it's so bad? <br />
<br />
And if you're gonna say that you play classic and not retail, then my god that's ironic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinastorm</div><div class="date">2019-09-25, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then why even have 2 different faction if you're going to just hold hands and have the &quot;let's all be friends&quot; attitude? <br />
<br />
Isn't warcraft based on having two different factions fighting against each other?<br />
<br />
This is the most ridiculous thing I've seen.<br />
<br />
That was my point, we are (pretty obviously at this point) headed toward a one faction, or no faction, system. All that means is we'll have more people to play with. <br />
<br />
PvP can still work. All you have to do is add some lore reframing it as gladiatorial games, and boom. <br />
<br />
Warcraft is not just Horde vs Allie. If you wanna get lore technical, in the grand scheme of the warcraft universe of conflict, the horde vs ally conflict ranks VERY low in terms of importance. Shocking, true, statement.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyphael</div><div class="date">2019-09-25, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just watched the cinematics at home with sound and I must say, it's a satisfying end, especially to someone who hated Sylvanas. Saurfang got his honor. It seems Thrall may be burdened with the mantle of Warchief again. &quot;We don't get to hide.&quot; <br />
<br />
Just wondering why Sylvanas would reveal to the Horde her master plan in which the Horde was just being used, she was winning Mak'gorah. Seemed like Blizzard's way out to rushing the end, she wasn't in a position where she had to be overthrown yet if she was about to kill Saurfang and win anyway. It's not like Thrall, Anduin and Zak'han could have made a line. &quot;Ok, my turn!&quot; Oh shit, you killled Anduin, ok, I'm next!&quot; Sylvanas would have remained Warchief, continued to benefit from throwing meat shields at N'zoth, and crushed the Alliance while at it, unless she herself doesn't want to lead the charge against N'zoth and hide in the sidelines while the Alliance/Horde throw themselves at N'zoth?</div></div><hr />
