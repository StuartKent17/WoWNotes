Cataclysm Closed Beta - NDA Lift<br />
The NDA is lifted. You're free to discuss anything on the forums. <br />
<br />
I didn't expect it to be lifted that soon, some pages look ugly, working on it. Recent forum posts box disabled to (try to) prevent a crash of the site.<br />

They will give you an email, HOWEVER, it is always safest to check battle.net. The cata invite will simply show up on your account. There are no codes to input, so all your need to do is log in and check.<br />

<br />
It's A city, but it's not a permanent city.<br />
<br />
Goblins also temporarily get Kezan, but they lose access to it permanently, just like Worgens lose access to Gilneas which ultimately becomes a new battleground.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It looks like the first wave of invites HAS NOT been sent out yet. If they had been the Alpha/Beta forums would be flooded with noobs.<br />
<br />
I'm going to say that since they're not only doing maintenance on the beta right now, tbu they're probably also pushing a new patch, the invites will not go out until those servers are up again, to allow new players that chance to start in right away.<br />
<br />
TLDR: Yes. Yes. Yes.</div></div><hr />

More like ~120k hp for tanks, they've noted they want to make hp pools much closer for tanks and other dps'rs<br />

<br />
Cataclysm sees quite a few changes to existing lore. This is more a story progression than anything, but with some of them being very dramatic changes, I wanted to recap everything I've found so far.<br />
<br />
Horde<br />
<br />
* Garrosh Hellscream is the new Warchief and has reinforced Orgrimmar and many Horde outposts around Azeroth with dark iron. He's also reclaimed Gorehowl -- his father's weapon -- and now wields it.<br />
* Thrall was captured by SI:7 (and it looks like Garrosh actually set that up), to be later rescued by the Goblins during their new player experience.<br />
* Cairne Bloodhoof was poisoned by Magatha Grimtotem and is now dead.<br />
* Baine Bloodhoof is now the leader of the Tauren race in Thunderbluff (those that are part of the Horde).<br />
* The Forsaken went against Garrosh's wishes and released a plague on Gilneas, killing most of its inhabitants. Sylvannas is expected to be further in the dog house once Garrosh learns of this.<br />
* The Horde have, thanks to Goblin ingenuity, built &quot;The Bomb&quot; -- a weapon of mass destruction -- and unleash it on a night elf village in Stonetalon Mountains. Garrosh, displeased with the slaughter of innocent people, kills the general who ordered the bomb to be dropped.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Alliance<br />
<br />
* Magni Bronzebeard attempted some sort of ritual in Old Ironforge and was turned to stone, leaving Ironforge without a single ruler. While attempts are made to remove the curse from Magni, Muradin Bronzebeard, Moira Thaurassin and Falstad Wildhammer have formed a council of rulers.<br />
* Varian Wrynn has devoted resources to upgrading many Alliance outposts on Azeroth, including Sentinel Hill.<br />
* The worgen &quot;curse&quot; was actually created by a sect of druids known as the Druids of the Scythe, wielders of the Scythe of Elune and the magic it provided. They fell victim to the feral nature of the worgen and lost control of themselves -- forever transforming. They had to be locked away in the Emerald Dream, though Archmage Arugal managed to free some and in turn released the curse upon the denizens of Gilneas. The trees you see in various screenshots with the glowing blue liquid flowing from them are trees where the Druids of the Scythe were contained and put into slumber.<br />
* The Park in Stormwind was indeed destroyed by Deathwing after he emerged in Azeroth. This is confirmed by a group of NPCs chatting before the boat ride out to Vashj'ir. Some had previously thought that an earthquake may have destroyed it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Other<br />
<br />
* Edwin VanCleef is dead. His daughter, Vanessa VanCleef is now the leader of the Defias Brotherhood. She has unleashed a plot to bring down Stormwind after witnessing the assassination of her father some 5 years ago.<br />
* Corporal Keeshan is the main character behind the Redridge zone progression, known as John J. Keeshan. The story revolves around the Blackrock Orcs planning an invasion of Lakeshire, and plays out much like a Rambo movie where you must recover Keeshan's bandanna, bow, knife and a locket from his lost love, as well as freeing his captured Bravo Company friends.<br />
* Kalec is rounding up all of the blue dragonflight, as he fears the death of Malygos will be a sign of weakness and Deathwing will send out agents to assassinate the remaining dragons within the flight. This holds true as the black dragonflight has invaded Azshara to hunt down Azuregos. Kalec and Azuregos help low level Horde players to repel the invasion.<br />
* Malfurion Stormrage is the only thing keeping Darkshore from being devoured by the Cataclysm; he's created a giant twister in the middle of the zone.<br />
* The Twilight's Hammer are attempting to summon an Old God in Darkshore, Soggoth the Slitherer.<br />
* Deathwing has summoned Ragnaros and agents of the Plane of Fire into Hyjal. The players go through a linear quest chain culminating in the banishment of Ragnaros back to the Plane of Fire. Involved in the chain (and fights leading up to and including Ragnaros): Ysera, Aspect of the Green Dragonflight; Malfurion Stormrage, Jarod Shadowsong, Cenarius, Goldrinn, Aviana, Aessina, Tortulla, Hamuul Runetotem, Fandral Staghelm. It's pretty damn epic.<br />
* The Cenarion Circle and Cenarion Expedition are the reason for Desolace seeing the growth it has, and have thus named the middle of the zone the Cenarion Wildlands.<br />
* Ysondre is the last of the Dragons of Nightmare, and although she has been saved from the nightmare, she states she can never return to the green dragonflight. Emeriss and Lethon are already dead; Ysondre helps players kill Taerar during a quest chain in Feralas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm beta test! Patch notes listed here are not comprehensive and will be changed throughout the testing process. <br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
The Alliance starting experience for worgen is available. Venture through the cursed lands of Gilneas to discover your true path! Currently the female worgen character is not available for testing. <br />
The Horde starting experience for goblins is available. Beginning on the Isle of Kezan in a goblin paradise, players will face a treacherous road ahead! <br />
The level cap for all characters is 82. <br />
Players may use our Character Copy feature for copying existing characters to beta realms, or may choose from high-level pre-made template characters.<br />
<br />
Zones<br />
<br />
Mount Hyjal and Vashj'ir, two new level 78-82 zones, are available for testing. Players may find their way to these zones by speaking with temporary teleportation NPCs located in any major city. <br />
The level ranges of Gilneas and the Lost Isles are in the process of being adjusted slightly. Creature, quest, and quest reward levels are all being altered so that players finish questing in these zones roughly by level 12. Further fine tuning will continue in future content updates. <br />
Several zones have had quest maps integrated. <br />
Eastern Kingdoms<br />
<br />
Arathi Highlands, Blasted Lands, Dun Morogh, Duskwood, Elwynn Forest, Loch Modan, Northshire, Westfall, Hinterlands and Redridge Mountains are ready for testing. <br />
Stranglethorn Vale (currently Horde only) is available for testing.<br />
<br />
Kalimdor<br />
<br />
Most zones in Kalimdor are available for testing, though work continues on polishing the quest experience and flow, as well as zone aesthetics.<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
<br />
Teleportation NPCs in Stormwind, Orgrimmar, and Dalaran can transport players to any available new dungeons, including players who are ghosts. <br />
Blackrock Caverns, a new level 79-81 five-player dungeon, is available for testing. <br />
Throne of the Tides, a new level 79-81 five-player dungeon, is partially available for testing.<br />
<br />
Classes: General<br />
<br />
Ammo has been removed from the game. <br />
The character levels at which classes gain new spells and abilities have changed. <br />
The glyph system is in the process of being altered. Existing glyphs may not be fully supported or functional. <br />
Many item and class stats have been changed or removed. <br />
Rage has been normalized. <br />
Spells and abilities no longer have multiple ranks and now scale with character level. <br />
Talents trees have changed and are still in the process of being reworked.<br />
<br />
Death Knights<br />
<br />
A dedicated tanking tree has been implemented. <br />
The way in which runes recharge has changed.<br />
<br />
Druids<br />
<br />
A new Eclipse mechanic has been added for druids. The feature is functional, but the interface art is still a work in-progress.<br />
<br />
Hunters<br />
<br />
Five pets can now be stored with the hunter at all times. Any one of these five pets can be summoned via the Call Pet ability. <br />
Focus has replaced mana as a new resource. <br />
Hunters now start with a pet at level 1. <br />
The Stable will now store 20 pets. If a pet is moved into the Stable, its talents are wiped.<br />
<br />
Warlocks<br />
<br />
Soul Shards have been removed from the game as items. Instead, they now exist as a resource system necessary for using, or altering the mechanics of certain spells.<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
<br />
The ability to use third-party addons has been temporarily disabled for the test environment. <br />
The Arena Teams pane has been improved. <br />
Auto-quests have been added to the game. Players will automatically be given an auto-quest by entering specific areas in the game world. This alert will appear distinctly in the Objectives pane via the Advanced Quest Tracking feature. These quests will still be given to players with full Quest Logs, but will count toward the 25 total allotted quests if the log is not full. <br />
The Character pane has been redesigned. Character stats can now be shown or hidden via the Show All Details/Hide All Details button on the bottom left. When shown, all character stats will be visible in a window to the right of the pane. Stat sections can be reorganized by clicking and dragging them up or down the pane. <br />
The Professions panes now have more filtering and search functionality, as well as buttons to easily link recipes in the chat frame. <br />
Many of the yellow System Messages that would display in the chat frame when leveling up have been removed. <br />
New text animations now alert players as they level up, also providing information on when new talents, spells and abilities are available. <br />
Professions and Class Trainers windows have been altered to more clearly display available and upcoming purchases. <br />
The Spellbook interface has been improved for greater ease-of-use and visual appeal.<br />
<br />
Graphics<br />
<br />
Experimental support for DX11 (can be enabled by passing ‘-d3d11’ on the command line or adding SET gxApi &quot;d3d11&quot; to the Config.WTF file). <br />
OpenGL Hardware Cursor support (can be enabled on the Video Resolution Panel). <br />
Improved water and lava rendering system (enabled by the Liquid Detail slider on the Video Effects Panel)<br />
<br />
0 = Classic Water <br />
1 = New Water (fake reflections) <br />
2 = New Water (ocean has real reflection for terrain) <br />
These values are likely to change during Beta.<br />
<br />
Dynamic Sunshafts effect (enabled by the Sunshafts option on the Video Effects Panel).<br />
<br />
Known Issues<br />
<br />
Selecting high Liquid Detail when using Geforce 6 &amp; 7 series video cards will currently prevent lava and water from rendering properly. You can temporarily restore liquid to the world by reducing the Liquid Detail setting via the Video Effects Panel, or by typing “waterDetail 0” in your Config.WTF file.</div></div><hr />

If I wanted to do damage, I'd roll a DPS class, when players start asking me what my DPS is as a healer, that's when I'll quit this game.<br />
<br />
Many healers DPS now (and many more DPSed before!). There are points where the damage to the raid just stops, or lowers and it would be intelligent for a healer to at least wand if not burn a little mana to help out. They did it in Vanilla, and even in TBC. WOTLK a Healer couldn't do it much, aside from a very few fights, and only for a short period of time (a good example would be during Saurfang before marks/beasts go out, given that people are standing in the right place and blood boils aren't nibbling at anyone's health).<br />
<br />
This gives a healer something to do other than play whack a mole.<br />
<br />
If you don't WANT to do it, make sure you're the tank healer and enjoy continuing to play whack a mole. But for your secondary/raid healers, understand that Blizzard wants you to do more than not stand in the fire. They've been trying to implement this for some time, and little by little they're putting DPS into healers - not to be a &quot;competitive&quot; style of DPS, but just something fun to do while waiting between phases of fights.<br />
<br />
Note: They're removing the FSR - so you will not be spending your wait periods regenning anymore. You will regen at all times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The sounds more like a problem with the community rather than the tactics. I never really cared for leveling Shadow as my Priest, thinking back I really wanted the character to represent 'holiness'. Shadow didn't really offer the feel I was looking for. Back then I really would've loved a second option, a light-based DPS tree to quest and level in. I see these new talents as a way to please players who felt the way I did. If raid organizers want to push further strain on their healers by demanding more than a healer and his/her mana can handle, well, you can probably expect healers to push back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ive seen the goblin quest line that some people claim to make Garrosh out to have set up Thrall .... and to be honest, the only reason people come to that conclusion is because they dislike him so much. I remember not to long ago everyone was convinced Garrosh killed Cairne. The quest text regarding thrall goes like this Garrosh says &quot; Thrall had you deliver this? &lt; the warcheif takes a step back visably shaken and pale&gt; I understand the meaning of this all to well, goblin&quot;. To me, it makes much more sense that Garrosh cannot belive the si:7 has infiltrated so far into horde affairs that they knew where thrall would be. (especially after he kicks non orcs out of his throne room) we dont need more crazy rumors about Garrosh, we Have enough</div></div><hr />

Garrosh, displeased with the slaughter of innocent people, kills the general who ordered the bomb to be dropped.<br />
* Magni Bronzebeard attempted some sort of ritual in Old Ironforge and was turned to stone, leaving Ironforge without a single ruler. While attempts are made to remove the curse from Magni, Muradin Bronzebeard, Moira Thaurassin and Falstad Wildhammer have formed a council of rulers.<br />
* Edwin VanCleef is dead. His daughter, Vanessa VanCleef is now the leader of the Defias Brotherhood. She has unleashed a plot to bring down Stormwind after witnessing the assassination of her father some 5 years ago.<br />
* Kalec is rounding up all of the blue dragonflight, as he fears the death of Malygos will be a sign of weakness and Deathwing will send out agents to assassinate the remaining dragons within the flight. This holds true as the black dragonflight has invaded Azshara to hunt down Azuregos. Kalec and Azuregos help low level Horde players to repel the invasion.<br />
* Malfurion Stormrage is the only thing keeping Darkshore from being devoured by the Cataclysm; he's created a giant twister in the middle of the zone.<br />
* The Twilight's Hammer are attempting to summon an Old God in Darkshore, Soggoth the Slitherer.<br />
* Ysondre is the last of the Dragons of Nightmare, and although she has been saved from the nightmare, she states she can never return to the green dragonflight. Emeriss and Lethon are already dead; Ysondre helps players kill Taerar during a quest chain in Feralas.<br />

My favorite parts about this spoiler. I would like to know a few things, however:<br />
<br />
1. Does the Alliance get a WMD like the Horde, courtesy of the Gnomes? All the radiation from Gnomeregan might be put to good use.<br />
<br />
2. What exactly was Magni doing that got him turned to stone?<br />
<br />
3. If even Edwin VanCleef wasn't safe, what will become of Mr. Smite!?<br />
<br />
4. So... will Azuregos be hostile to Alliance now?<br />
<br />
5. How exactly does a twister in the middle of the zone stop a cataclysmic event?<br />
<br />
6. What body part does Soggoth the Slitherer represent?<br />
<br />
7. Why can Ysondre never return to the Green Dragonflight? And how did Emeriss and Lethon die?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gractan</div><div class="date">2010-07-01, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive seen the goblin quest line that some people claim to make Garrosh out to have set up Thrall .... and to be honest, the only reason people come to that conclusion is because they dislike him so much. I remember not to long ago everyone was convinced Garrosh killed Cairne. The quest text regarding thrall goes like this Garrosh says &quot; Thrall had you deliver this? &lt; the warcheif takes a step back visably shaken and pale&gt; I understand the meaning of this all to well, goblin&quot;. To me, it makes much more sense that Garrosh cannot belive the si:7 has infiltrated so far into horde affairs that they knew where thrall would be. (especially after he kicks non orcs out of his throne room) we dont need more crazy rumors about Garrosh, we Have enough<br />
<br />
I haven't played anything in Cata to be able to say for sure, but I agree with you on this. That definitely doesn't spell out that Garrosh did this. Besides, if he did, why wouldn't Thrall just come back and slap the hell out of him? (And for those saying Garrosh would beat him, I'm sure Thrall could bring allies like the tauren and trolls with him.) <br />
<br />
Also, I find these things interesting...<br />
&quot;* Baine Bloodhoof is now the leader of the Tauren race in Thunderbluff (those that are part of the Horde).<br />
* The Forsaken went against Garrosh's wishes and released a plague on Gilneas, killing most of its inhabitants. Sylvannas is expected to be further in the dog house once Garrosh learns of this.<br />
* The Horde have, thanks to Goblin ingenuity, built &quot;The Bomb&quot; -- a weapon of mass destruction -- and unleash it on a night elf village in Stonetalon Mountains. Garrosh, displeased with the slaughter of innocent people, kills the general who ordered the bomb to be dropped.&quot;<br />
The part about those Tauren that are apart of the Horde...what does that mean? Did some Tauren like the Runetotems get the boot? Is there a split in the Tauren?<br />
The Forsaken have done this in Gilneas AND took out Southshore...getting a little aggressive I see...<br />
Garrosh is furious with the slaughtering of innocents? This makes me wonder if Garrosh has finally stepped up from being a little emo whiner to a true leader, but is finding that lots of people aren't respecting him as one.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.....two more things added.<br />
<br />
* Tiron Fordring and the Argent Dawn have taken over Hearthglen. Tirion Fordring now resides within Mardenholde Keep; his Eastern Plaguelands version at Thondroril River has been removed.<br />
* The Alliance and Forsaken are fighting over control of Andorhal and the remaining Scourge presence there. The Alliance, lead by Thassarian, have taken control of the western portion of the town while the Forsaken, lead by Koltira Deathweaver, have taken control of the eastern portion.</div></div><hr />

although this might happen, they will be converting items currently in the game to align with the new cataclysm itemization guidelines, so i'd say there's a really high chance of the lvl 277 items and prior to contain more stamina/str/whatever than they currently do.</div></div><hr />

Well, their current Kraken model is some giant fish-looking thing (Search for Oacha'noa on wowhead for an example), so I'm hoping the Leviathan picture becomes the new Kraken model and the current Kraken model is updated and changed to Leviathan.</div></div><hr />

But the worst thing is Garrosh. Didn't even notice his model at first, but jesus christ he doesn't even look like an orc anymore. He looks like a retarded ogre.<br />
On Worldofraids.com you can actually see an article about much of the lore changes in the world, such as <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;SPOILER&gt;&gt; magni putting a curse upon himself, making him forever stoneformed, causing his daughter Moira Thaurissan, Muradin Bronzebeard and Falstad Wildhammer to form a council, to rule IF and the dwarves. Also, it appears that Garrosh isn't such an ass after all. It seems like he didn't agree to the attack on Gilneas, and Cairne dies from someone else's hand, not his. And Apparently Garrosh executed a Horde captain that caused the slaughter of a night elf town, killing lots of innocent people. &lt;&lt;SPOILER END&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
This is the main reason that I am so friggin disappointed with Garrosh' new model. I am actually starting to like him a bit</div></div><hr />

That's actually pretty awesome. I like the idea of an equal playing field when the expansion starts. Hard to catch up and all of that, so this way nobody will be stuck left behind.

But the worst thing is Garrosh. Didn't even notice his model at first, but jesus christ he doesn't even look like an orc anymore. He looks like a retarded ogre.<br />
On Worldofraids.com you can actually see an article about much of the lore changes in the world, such as <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;SPOILER&gt;&gt; magni putting a curse upon himself, making him forever stoneformed, causing his daughter Moira Thaurissan, Muradin Bronzebeard and Falstad Wildhammer to form a council, to rule IF and the dwarves. Also, it appears that Garrosh isn't such an ass after all. It seems like he didn't agree to the attack on Gilneas, and Cairne dies from someone else's hand, not his. And Apparently Garrosh executed a Horde captain that caused the slaughter of a night elf town, killing lots of innocent people. &lt;&lt;SPOILER END&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
This is the main reason that I am so friggin disappointed with Garrosh' new model. I am actually starting to like him a bit<br />
<br />
Actually he does order the attack on Gilneas... he just doesn't like Sylvanas using the new plague on them...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not saying that these greens and blues won't trump the current epics(coz they will), just that the difference in stats wont be as ridiculous as it is now.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing from the relative look...well, remember the place in Darkshore that was a giant skull with a sword sticking out of it...kind looks like it would belong to the same creature<br />
<br />
<br />
garroshs updated form looks awesome but the troll druid forms are kinda weird<br />
<br />
Garrosh's model looks the same as the leaked image on the Garrosh toy. http://www.figures.com/forums/attachments/news/3794d1267730523-new-world-warcraft-figure-images-1orcwarrior.jpg Anyway, its not spikes and metal, but then again, the Maghar orcs never were about that...those were signs of the demonic tainted horde. And as for the troll models, I think trolls look weird as hell anyways, so the druid forms are oddly fitting.</div></div><hr />

Horde<br />
<br />
* Garrosh Hellscream is the new Warchief and has reinforced Orgrimmar and many Horde outposts around Azeroth with dark iron. He's also reclaimed Gorehowl -- his father's weapon -- and now wields it.<br />
* Thrall was captured by SI:7 (and it looks like Garrosh actually set that up), to be later rescued by the Goblins during their new player experience.<br />
* Cairne Bloodhoof was poisoned by Magatha Grimtotem and is now dead.<br />
* Baine Bloodhoof is now the leader of the Tauren race in Thunderbluff (those that are part of the Horde).<br />
* The Forsaken went against Garrosh's wishes and released a plague on Gilneas, killing most of its inhabitants. Sylvannas is expected to be further in the dog house once Garrosh learns of this.<br />
* The Horde have, thanks to Goblin ingenuity, built &quot;The Bomb&quot; -- a weapon of mass destruction -- and unleash it on a night elf village in Stonetalon Mountains. Garrosh, displeased with the slaughter of innocent people, kills the general who ordered the bomb to be dropped.<br />
<br />
<br />
This Horde lore makes a LOT more sense than the stuff that Boub was posting from earlier leaks. Garrosh may be a bit of an arrogant idiot, but some of the stuff he'd been portrayed as doing earlier was borderline psychotic and made the Horde look like Nazi Germany on speed. This has a lot of the same elements, but portrays Garrosh as maybe a bit arrogant, and maybe in a bit over his head, but not a mad man. Definitely a better overall storyline (Not that Blizzard can be blamed for the &quot;old story&quot;, since it was mostly guess work on the part of fansites).</div></div><hr />

You didn't really expect shadowmourne to surpass level 85 epics, even at the lowest item level, did you? Now for the level 81 two handed sword, thats a bit crazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be a huuuge zone then. There is the old Loch Modan, then to the right some mountain area, then to the right of that, even more zone. Plus, it doesn't look like there is an easy way to get though that dark mountain area between the lock and the highland part.<br />
<br />
An actual map would help a lot.</div></div><hr />

I kind of wish that the legendary items could become Bind on Account and then adjusted with the level, with how much effort it takes to get them. I mean, the hunter bow was the easiest...and that was just a complete shit droprate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the few hands-on around you can read that you can fly in azeroth, i think they also said it somewhere, but i cant recall where.</div></div><hr />
