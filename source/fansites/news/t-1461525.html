<br />
Welcome to the third edition of Artcraft! I’m Chris Robinson, senior art director for World of Warcraft, and today we’ll be discussing the revamp of the female Orc model. As part of that, we'll touch on our overall character redesign philosophy, show before and after images, talk about our art process with this particular model, and give you a glimpse at some of her awesome facial expressions courtesy of our animation team.<br />
<br />
Before we start talking specifically about the female Orc update, I’d like to address some questions we’ve received regarding our goals for these revamps. Boiling it down to essentials, our primary focus is to upgrade the aspects of player character models that currently exist in-game.<br />
<br />
We’re all creative people with tons of great ideas, and we could certainly keep designing and redesigning and never actually release anything—and while we’d no doubt have a lot of fun doing that, obviously we need to set specific goals so we can actually create finished artwork for you to see and play. That’s not always easy to do—we’re a passionate bunch, and we get incredibly excited about new features and want to do everything. Nonetheless, staying focused and keeping the scope reasonable (while still ambitious) helps us stay on track and avoid having to make painful cuts later on down the line. We really wanted to prevent that with the player-character revamp, so we made the decision early on to stay focused on improving what already exists in-game, and making sure we really nail it.<br />
<br />
That said, we’ve also read your great ideas and feedback about features that you’d like to see as character customization options. Your collective voice matters to us, and we’d love to bring some of the coolest ideas to life someday if we can. We’ll continue to share behind-the-scenes information with you in these Artcraft pieces, and I look forward to giving you more insight into our plans for character models beyond the initial release of Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
Enough about philosophy—now on to the female Orc!<br />
<br />
We’ve actually been working on this particular model for quite some time now. You may have caught some brief glimpses of her new model in the Warlords of Draenor announcement cinematic at BlizzCon. Since then, we’ve been balancing our effort among all of the models currently in progress, and she’s received some additional polish along the way.<br />
<br />
When we first discussed the direction for this character, I think we all agreed right off the bat that we wanted to focus on her “warrior” side a little more. That means moving away from the more doe-eyed version we know now toward a character you would expect to see fighting on the front lines alongside any of her Horde brothers and sisters. We’re still ironing out the fine details, so the art you see here is subject to change, but I’ll let Senior 3D Artist Dusty Nolting and Lead Animator Steve Aguilar expand a bit on where we currently are with our green-skinned . . . oh wait, green and brown-skinned, long-tusked heroine. <br />
<br />
Lead Animator Steve Aguilar:<br />
<br />
“The original female Orc’s facial expression is pretty much a blank stare, which sadly doesn’t convey much life or personality. We wanted to give her more of an edge so she would project a confident ‘Don’t mess with me!’ attitude. Now that these new high-definition models have a facial rig attached, the animators can bring to life the personality that has been so sorely missing. She now looks and feels more like you’d expect an Orc to. When you get your hands on the expansion, be sure to take a look at her talking animations, dancing animations, and emotes to see all the various expressions the team has created for her.”<br />
<br />
Character Artist Dusty Nolting adds:<br />
<br />
“Orcs are one of the most iconic parts of the Warcraft universe. Because she’s so identifiable, it was important for us to use the original female Orc as a starting point and stay true to the silhouette and proportions that existed. The goal was a new model with much higher fidelity, while still retaining that classic look. We want a strong female counterpart to the male, equally battle-ready in appearance, yet still feminine.”<br />
<br />
That’s all we have for the female Orc right now. We hope you’re continuing to enjoy this series as we invite you to meet the team, get some insight into our development process, and get an early look at some of the art we’re creating for Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
Thanks, and see you next time!<br />

ALTHOUGH they could of showed it off with one of the more &quot;fierce&quot;-looking faces...and not the common-as-muck &quot;soft&quot; Fem Orc face! FIERCE IS BEST.<br />

Also, her buttocks, ears, breasts and nose look so much more natural in the new model (really, only just noticed how unnatural they look in the current models!!!).</div></div><hr />

Also shouders seems a little to square and broad for a female compared to her old model.</div></div><hr />

No, they just confirmed that brown skinned orcs exist. The vast majority of NPC orcs on Draenor will be brown skinned ones and of course they are going to use the new models for them as well.

ALTHOUGH they could of showed it off with one of the more &quot;fierce&quot;-looking faces...and not the common-as-muck &quot;soft&quot; Fem Orc face! FIERCE IS BEST.<br />
<br />
Also, her buttocks, ears, breasts and nose look so much more natural in the new model (really, only just noticed how unnatural they look in the current models!!!).<br />
<br />
There's actually a blue-eyed female orc face that's even worse, this one was a decent compromise for one that would be suitably photogenic for the unveil. I do hope that we won't be stuck with pandaren sameface with the final models though.</div></div><hr />

Calves that size are well within the range of realistic considering someone who works out, and while the hands may be disproportionate, thats always kinda been blizzards thing, a polished cartoonyness and original design. Personally i think the model is amazing, and am thinking of joining the orc master race unless den troll models blow me away</div></div><hr />

@Hinoen: This is in reference to the brown skinned Orcs of Draenor, who will be using the new updated models as well of course.<br />
<br />
We know there are a lot of requests for additional features and options, but as stated in this article &quot;we made the decision early on to stay focused on improving what already exists in-game, and making sure we really nail it.<br />
<br />
That said, we’ve also read your great ideas and feedback about features that you’d like to see as character customization options. Your collective voice matters to us, and we’d love to bring some of the coolest ideas to life someday if we can.&quot; <br />

In fairness to Blizzard, you're forgetting that they didn't show as much because the female human was not as further along in the process as others were.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Although, I dont really like the shave lines on the side of her head with some of the hair styles.. looks too much like dirt.. I prefer the clean shaven look of the original<br />
This is very recently posted, so you didn't miss anything in the original news post.<br />
<br />
They're actually shaved lines, not braids. In some of the shots you can see they're not exact and not symmetrical, and that's intentional. Chris tweeted some backstory, and the intent is to give a bit more of a savage-warrior type vibe.<br />
<br />
https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/436222244587466752<br />
Using the regular quote tags inside the blizzquote comes out looking weird, so here is what the tweet says:<br />
<br />
I painted in some shaved lines, like she shaves that area of her head with her axe as a sign of her kills. as an example of where we're making small adj. to give characters more depth without (hopefully) deviating too much</div></div><hr />

This is taken from the Artcraft for the human female model, but something to keep in mind nonetheless.<br />
<br />
[...] What you’re looking at here for the Human female is a single face option and a single skin tone on the base model without any animation or posing. When developing the base model we keep the expression on the face as devoid of emotion or expression as possible, as that allows our animators a greater range of motion when they start posing and morphing the face into different expressions. If we were to put any amount of expression—even a slight smile or mildly angry eyebrows—in the base model, that would carry through to every animation, and we'd end up with some very confused-looking characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I love the updated Orc Female other than her nerfed breasts and weird shave markings. The hair has a cool backstory I guess? But it doesn't seem personal when almost every Orc woman has it. And the shaved markings are new, and I hate it when they go out of their way to change the characters' design, so I dislike the markings. <br />
<br />
I don't understand what's wrong with breasts, why are they taboo now? Why is every female character getting a breast reduction? It makes her look less feminine-shaped and less like the original.</div></div><hr />

I find it disturbing that all shown models have same faces, similar how all Pandaren have (with only textures changing).<br />
<br />
Unlike the old models which are flat textures pasted onto heads, the new ones have expressions driven by an underlying bone system so the expression isn't just painted into the face. These previews are shown with neutral expressions mostly, except for the image that shows off the animations:<br />
<br />

<br />
And they will be making so much money out of this feature. Hundreds of thousands character customizations and race changes to be sold. They could even cash in a bit more by not releasing them all at once. There are many people willing to redesign their characters like mad, because &quot;New is always better!&quot; (Barney Stinson) every time they release a new race redesign. <br />
<br />
I think this is a great move. It feels like playing in a new engine, stays true to the comic style, makes them earn a lot of money, dramatically increases appeal to new players who were thrown off by the graphics before. It might even be start of a WoW renaissance if they get their content design right in WoD.</div></div><hr />

Lol...stop being silly. This is indeed a game, people wanting their toons to look good and nice doesn't at all suggest they are shallow and treating people badly based on looks IRL. If you haven't noticed by now, this orc looks NOTHING like a real human. <br />
<br />
You can play for the game play all you like, others appreciate the graphics as well as the gameplay. Duh. The current female orc feels very stiff in animations and her face has no character compared to the male. They have fixed this with this new model and it's no wonder people are drawn toward that.</div></div><hr />

The vast majority of NPC orcs on Draenor will be brown skinned ones and of course they are going to use the new models for them as well. This may point to them at least considering opening up the brown skin as an option, but it does not confirm anything.<br />
<br />
I think you're wrong. First off, they say &quot;our ... heroine&quot;, which pretty much means the player. They didn't say &quot;our ... orcs&quot;, which indeed would indicate that it might just be for NPCs, but the way they're wording it and expressing it makes it pretty obvious that this is indeed intended for the player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I race changed my main from goblin to orc last night in anticipation to get used to their different size and such way ahead. Unless they blow me away with the tauren female, my main will be orc female with soul for sure.</div></div><hr />

This seriously ruins it for me. I hate cornrows, why are they there? Shouldn't bald be bald? I dislike the new stance as well, and the arms look to be about the size of male orc arms.<br />
<br />
Overally really, really disappointed. On the bright side, this is the only bad remodel so far.</div></div><hr />

I think the boob shrinkage is good, makes them look less like implants since she is a muscular lady. Great job all around, Blizz!</div></div><hr />

I know they've been a little nervous about it but this may be their best model to date. I've never had much interest in playing an orc female in game. Until now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, since I guess Blizz wants to make sure you, above all others, buys WOD they will NOT implement those hair styles and new bloodelf update you say you want and then reverse yourself on. :)</div></div><hr />

Or at least some of them like old raid sets?</div></div><hr />
