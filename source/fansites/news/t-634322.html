Developing new content<br />
A lot the of 1.X content was already partially developed by the time the original game shipped. When a patch was released in that era, development on the next patch was already under way. This isn't to say we're making it up as we go now. We have clear outlines and development schedules. Ever since the release of The Burning Crusade though, the next patch to come out is more or less developed from scratch. The actual internal development pace has changed very little over time. If anything, content is developed more quickly now than it was when the game began. <br />
<br />
No offense intended, but that argument doesn' t make much sense at all. Either you completed the content or not... Unless you're saying you had a lot of partially created content that was abandoned that you went back to.<br />
Art assets take quite a bit of time. If dungeon and model art for something like Dire Maul is mostly completed long before the patch is slated to go live, it's going to take a lot less time to prepare that dungeon. Ulduar's been virtually built from the ground up since the release of Wrath of the Lich King. A lot of new art is being fed into this dungeon. <br />
<br />
Zarhym, doesn’t that somewhat contradict statements made by developers (Jeff Kaplan I believe it was) where it was said that they’re always “working two patches in advance”? Your statement seems to imply that only one patch is worked on at a time. Does working two patches in advance mean that they’re actually working on one while someone has a “cool idea” on paper for the other patch or does working on two patches at once mean that there’s actually designing and coding going on for two at the one time? <br />
That's why I said we're not making it up as we go, and have pretty clear outlines far in advance. For instance, a lot of art and programming for Ulduar has been in progress since before Wrath was released, and is very much still in progress now. At the same time though, every day there is a more clear picture of what 3.2 and beyond will bring. We're always looking and developing in advance, but a lot more of the basic structures and art assets for many of the 1.X content patches were already fairly far into development by the time the preceding patch was released.

[EU] Four Year Anniversary Celebration!<br />
Four years ago today, World of Warcraft was released in Europe. To celebrate all we have accomplished together over the past four years, we invite you to participate in one of our Four Year Anniversary Contests: http://www.wow-europe.com/en/contests/fouryear/ (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/contests/fouryear/)<br />
<br />
This year, we have teamed up with Dell and SwagDog to offer some cool prizes in our Four Year Anniversary Contests. Join in our first ever World of Warcraft T-Shirt Design Contest , where the grand prize winner's design will be printed on t-shirts and sold in our Blizzard Store, or the Four Years of World of Warcraft Fan Art Contest and you could win an XPS 1730 laptop from Dell, $65 (USD) worth of free shipping on items of your choice from SwagDog, a murloc plushy, six months of World of Warcraft game time, and a Gurky, the baby murloc key! <br />
<br />
Also, for our lore buffs out there, we have a Lore Contest where, by showing off your knowledge of World of Warcraft, you can win an XPS 1730 laptop from Dell, a murloc plushy, six months of World of Warcraft game time, and a Gurky, the baby murloc key! Check out the Terms and Conditions to enter: http://www.wow-europe.com/en/legal/contests/fouryear-contests-09.html (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/legal/contests/fouryear-contests-09.html)<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
Bouquet of Red Roses not dropping anymore<br />
The Bouquet of Red Roses no longer drops in the game; the Bouquet of Ebon Roses will also count for the achievement. The reason why the red roses are on the achievement is to allow those who have gotten a dungeon drop bouquet in past years to get said achievement. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14990774504-bouquet-of-red-roses.html))<br />
<br />
Bouquet of Ebon Roses only drops in WotLK instances<br />
I'm quite aware that not everyone is maximum level, and the majority of all holidays can be done below maximum level. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that all holiday content will be achievable by those who are not level capped, and we'll continue to develop some content that is accessible by higher level characters only. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14990774504-bouquet-of-red-roses.html))<br />
<br />
Chance-based achievements in meta-achievements<br />
It depends on the achievements; some we've removed from the meta, others have had their drop rates adjusted to be more reasonable, and still others are fine as they are. Understand that that statement does not mean that all achievements based on chance are being removed from the meta, because that is not so. The achievement I referenced specifically required you to get 20 different masks from something on a one-hour cooldown, resulting in a probability much lower than, say, Have Keg, Will Travel.<br />
<br />
We've no intention of removing chance entirely from the meta achievements, but the ones that still apply have reasonable acquisition rates. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/14990444897-world-events-w-low-probability-achievements.html))<br />

Love Tokens - Stormwind Harbor Bugged<br />
Don't do this in the Stormwind Harbor, as there's currently an issue with it that we're looking into. Aside from that, make certain your bags aren't full. (More info on Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/14990444898-love-is-in-the-air-bugged.html))<br />
<br />
Peddlefeet not part of the meta-achievement (Warcraftpets (http://www.warcraftpets.com/wow.pets/seasonal/miscellaneous/peddlefeet.asp?cat=31))<br />
If you're going for the Fool for Love meta achievement and not the pet for the sake of the pet itself, Perma-Peddle is not a part of the meta achievement any longer.<br />
<br />
Achievements are character specific currently, not account specific, and the holidays are not designed around achievements in any case. The lack of soulbinding on the Gifts of Adoration was an oversight. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/14990943031-sleep-deprivation-and-permapeddle.html))<br />
<br />
&quot;The Ice Stone Melting&quot; server message<br />
From what I can gather, this is an unintended message that keeps popping up on servers. The Ice Stone is supposed to be for the Midsummer Fire Festival. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14990463821-re-the-ice-stone-melting.html))<br />
<br />
The fix requires realm restarts, which we'll be doing off-peak so we don't interrupt this evening's gameplay. I apologize for all the melting in the meanwhile. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14990463821-re-the-ice-stone-melting.html))<br />

2 Years needed to get a Violet Proto-Drake (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/september/8970/mount_violetprotodrake.jpg) because of &quot;Brew of the Year (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1183)&quot; <br />
We're still comfortable with the length of time it takes to achieve the Violet Proto-Drake with Brew of the Year included -- and, yes, we're taking into account Death Knights, new characters, and people who missed last Brewfest or did not join the club. You'll be able to complete the meta achievement in time if you choose to concentrate on those achievements.<br />
<br />
There is a perception out there that the Violet Proto-Drake is the drake for &quot;casual&quot; players, but that isn't strictly true, in all honesty (and can devolve into a debate on what the definition of casual happens to be, which is subjective and not something I wish to get into.) It's the reward for participating in a great deal of the holiday content, and Brew of the Year factors into that content as it is achievable through participating a single instance of the Brewfest holiday and following through for one year. This is in contrast to Veteran Nanny, which required you to participate in Children's Week thrice, and achievements like A Mask For All Occasions, where the probability involved was too low to be reasonably included in the meta achievement. The Brew of the Month club is easily acquired during Brewfest, there's no game of chance involved, and it doesn't require revisiting the holiday provided you check your mail every month.<br />
<br />
Some achievements require skill, and some require time and a bit of dedication. This is one of the latter, and we've no plans currently to change it. <br />

We're okay with ignoring diseases on very easy targets but you should never feel like you can build a valid spec or rotation around ignoring Icy Touch or Plague Strike.

this will be changed, i dont doubt that at all. allt the cm's always says everything works as intended until blizzard says otherwise. anyone remembers the pve to pvp transfer?</div></div><hr />

Aside the fact that i COULD have gotten it last year, i didn't bother coz there were no achievements..<br />
Then there's the damn mount that everyone on the server will want, and has a low drop rate.<br />
<br />
I'm more worried about the children's week achievement though &quot;daily chores&quot; is heavily bugged still.. and will cause a LOT of QQ if the timer resets mid-week as it no doubt will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
its bug beacuse how the achievement is built. it doesnt check if you done the achiev everyday but if u do it in a 24hours period. let me explain.<br />
<br />
if u do the daily at 3 (15pm) you need to do it before 3 (15pm). if u turn in the quest past the time you turned it in yesterday, it fails.<br />
<br />
so if u really want that achiev. make sure for example that you take the cooking daily in dalaran. and turn it in earlier everyday.<br />
<br />
for example:<br />
<br />
monday: 3 (15pm)<br />
tuesday: 2 (14pm)<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
until the achiev is done. that way you will make sure to 100% that it wont fail.</div></div><hr />

I'm aware of how it works, but... it also has a tendency to reset to 0 whenever you do a BG.<br />
And, since you're expected to do BGs for some other parts of the meta,,, fun fun fun, not.</div></div><hr />

All the DKs whining because they have to wait a year, well so does everyone else who starts a new character after a world event. My DK couldn't get merrymaker because she couldn't use a flying mount yet. So should the flying mount requirement be removed? The answer from most would likely be a no it shouldn't.<br />
<br />
Same thing is with brew of the year. Those complaining about it are those who either 1)Started a DK (or other new character) after the event and 2) Those who saw it as pointless waste and didn't get it.<br />
<br />
None are reasons for it to be changed.</div></div><hr />

never heard of that. but if thats really the case, just do the bg achievements the first thing you do and save the daily one later same day.<br />

after all its just to kill 10 players with orphan and capture some flag/gy and stuff.<br />

wouldnt take more than MAX 2-3 hours depending luck/queues to bgs and such.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I have it and yes i know it's harsh for those that want the Proto-drake but I took the time to look into the achievements in the beta and sites that had the achievements listed from day one (like MMO-Champion) so I didn't bother to get any of the clothing but I got the membership.<br />

I'd be very sad if they removed it, because clearly this will be the only obstacles between 30% of a server flying over Krasus Landing with a violet drake and 90% of the said server.</div></div><hr />

Saying that they shouldn't remove it is just being an elitist jerk, you would have wanted them to remove it if you wouldn't have started brew of the year same as me.</div></div><hr />

I agree on that sense but like a poster above said first they were like &quot;NO PVE to PVP transfers! Its unfair!&quot; now you can take a char to 80 in Pve and transfer to pvp server, the point is blizz tends to go back on their words quite a lot and i dont expect this to be any different, you will see, by the time brewfest comes around (maybe even sooner) there will be so much complaints that they will remove brew of the year from the meta.<br />
I dont mind, i am only after that drake cause i want 100 mounts but in 2 weeks time i will have my Plagued proto drake so 310% speed all the way :D</div></div><hr />

For any DK, brew club is not the biggest killer, Veteran Nanny in Childrens week is: Acquire Egbert's Egg, Sleepy Willy, and Elekk Training Collar on one character. <br />

<br />
<br />
Beta was still going on around Brewfest, but it had nowhere near all the achievements listed and completed, like you even had a placeholder achievement for Solo-ing Onyxia. So that statement is false.<br />
<br />
Actually, achievements weren't completely listed as we know them today until they hit the game on Live, and this was after brewfest. I distinctly remember not having the 'kill bla bla Direbrew' achievement while I had several items of his lootlist.<br />
<br />
And I agree with the majority of the 'whiners'. This isn't about 'dedication', this is all down to 'happening to have done' the achievements before the achievement system was in the game. And when it comes to 'I want my mount to be special' - newsflash folks: I've gotten my Zulian Tiger two years ago, and now I see Death Knights on it. <br />
But you don't hear me bitch about that, now do you ?<br />
<br />
Remove that achievement as a requirement or alter it to requiring just 1 year. Period.</div></div><hr />

A Simple Re-Quest and similar achievements have been bugged since 3.0 launched, and frankly, it's absurd that they haven't been fixed yet.<br />

I fully expect Brew of the Year to be removed from the meta achievement when Brewfest rolls around. Complaints from the customers &gt; some stupid idea that sitting around for an extra year opening 1 mail every month is &quot;dedication.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I have played it for 3.5 years 200 days played.. Since the release of WOW two expansions have been released. Both expansions had new mounts everyone wants upon release. To think about the fact i would get an &quot;old&quot; proto drake mount over 2 years, and maybe 2 expansions later rly doesnt seem like a good investment of my time. Dont get me wrong, i do the achievements but i hope they short the time drastically cause 2 years for a mount wich by that time will be seen as &quot;ancient&quot; doesnt make scense. I even think 6 months would be to long for a different color mount.<br />
<br />
I got more chance getting the protodrake from the HC, Raid achievements, a Gladiator mount of the Egg mount then the violet proto-drake. If Blizzard classifies the violet proto-drake a mount for &quot;casual&quot; players, then i wish all casuals good luck! :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calaba</div><div class="date">2009-02-12, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is, getting the proto drake still takes a lot of luck. Even if everyone tries, some might not get ALL the achievements done. Some may only miss 1 achievement, and will have to wait until it comes round again. It could be something really simple, like never winning a toothpick, or not managing a flag cap for childrens week. Then there's the number of people who just aren't bothering to get it. Which is quite a lot. Basically, yes there'll be a fair number of people who'll get this achievement done during this years brewfest. But it won't be as many as a lot of people are thinking; it certainly won't be half the server.<br />
<br />
Still, at the moment, the bag of candies remains pretty random, having to win the RNG twice or more. And i'd expect they'll eventually make it so that you only need 1 brew of the month and not all 12.</div></div><hr />

Basically Blizzard is putting that holiday's meta achivement on part with doing all of the Heroic Raid achievements (as the black proto is also 310% if I remember). Those achievements are meant to be hard and as such there needs to be some kind of limiting factor on this as well... This and Veteran Nanny (as well as bad luck if things like Masks and Perma were still in) ARE the limiting factors.<br />
<br />
The obvious response is that time =/= difficulty (just remember that this is true for people who are impatient - which if you are upset, may be you) but I guess I'm a little confused as to why some are so up in arms about this now when all the relevant information regarding brew of the month club being an achievement was available DURING Brewfest (if you're doing the required research on this NOW and suddenly you realize you didn't make the boat for 1 year vs 2, wouldn't it be just as easy to say that it was your own fault for not paying attention in the first place?)</div></div><hr />

Anybody willing to fly all over the place getting stinkin coins has proven they arent really casual and its BS that these people are gimped a year of waiting.

I think what he means is, they'd have a lot of the artwork done from HoS, HoL and outside areas. They'd already have concept drawings about what the rest would look like. They could even have a file containing the actual layout, but at that stage could still be changed. That doesn't mean to say they'd finished designing the bosses, or actually implementing the artwork into the instance.<br />
<br />
In fact, it's very likely that they already have concept diagrams and stuff for Icecrown Citadel, and they may have even started to put together parts of the instance. This doesn't mean it's anything close to finished, though.</div></div><hr />

They mean that there was Uldaman before, and probably concepts for both Uldum und Ulduar for years. What has to be built from the ground up is actual models and textures and doodads and lighting and that stuff.</div></div><hr />

So, why not they don't offer every single achievement for purchase for a little gold on the next brewfest? So every single toon on the server can get the 310% drake together? Go QQ for something really serious.<br />
<br />
Let's talk about this seriously now. The achievement system was alread in the PTR. Every site had most of the achievements on it alread. So you could see that Blizzard waste their time with some really stupid achievements.<br />
<br />
Checking the 2008 Brewfest, everything was almost the same, then there was a single new item that altough wasn't that expensive (you could get those tokens fast even if you were going for the stuff you didn't bought in 2007) it was really weird giving a &quot;new&quot; (NEW! No old or ordinary stuff) brew every month of the year.<br />
<br />
Why Blizzard wouldn't use that crap for achievement?!?!?!?!? I just bought it with my 4 toons. The only one without it is my DK for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the people that couldn't play the entire 2008 Brewfest event. I know how it feels 'cause from my 4 &quot;BotM&quot; toons, only one is still in game for the Drake 'cause I didn't have the chance to meet all the requirements for all of them (lvl 80 for Gundrak Heroic Elder, lvl77 for Horde Brother in Icecrown, Ogrila dailies not open on another toon, etc...). For the others that had the chance, sorry, but you're all the same lazy ppl that QQ about the recently discovery of the &quot;325 cooking skill&quot; in winterveil (and most of you just decided to QQ 'til Blizzard remove that instead of leveing it to just 325 easily @ lvl70+).<br />

So you mean that EVERYONE that wants the drake must hang around on the PTR and checking all different wow sites just to get a mount?! You must be stupid.

If you're posting this at mmo-champion.com then you had the chance to start it before it was too late since the relevant information was posted on this website and many others. Some people save Winter Veil gifts from one year to the next too so they get to open them early... it's just a choice they make banking on a future benefit to doing so (not unlike reading over publicly tested data posted on this website.) Again, there is no precedent thus far that every player should be riding around on 310% mounts so why demand for it to be different now?</div></div><hr />

There are some of us that did all the brewfest quests 2 years ago, and did not have the PTR during the last Brewfest. Basically, because I chose to do brewfest on an alt last year, due to my main having done it the year before, I am now going to have to wait ANOTHER year to get my violet drake on my main? This isn't QQ about not having done the event. This is QQ about having done the event too long ago for it to have counted. I hope they remove this achievement for that reason.</div></div><hr />

4 pages of QQ for a damn achievement and these are probably the same people that threaten to quit when their server goes down.<br />

3 pets, 1 for each year = 3 years to get a violet proto drake, to those who says that the more time it takes to get it = Difficult. then why not add veteran nanny into the meta achivement for childerns week? all thats matters is time, not based on luck or anything else. so i actually wouldn't be suprised if blizzard removes this from the brewfest meta achivement.</div></div><hr />

It just lacked any appeal and I knew of the achievement. I still think it's dumb to have to wait a whole year for the thing. <br />
<br />
My suggestion would be make it so having the membership would be part of the achievement, and that the different brews were available to purchase for brewfest tickets. Make it so it would take a whole brewfest to get enough tickets to get each brew. That way folks could save for membership and maybe buy the brews that would come much later in the year. That way you'd only have to wait a few months for some brews to arrive, but wouldn't take the whole year. It seems like that would provide a nice balance for both the people who started right away and those who weren't lucky enough to get right on it.</div></div><hr />

I really hope blizzard does remove it just to be fair to those who dont spend their time trying to find an inside look at coming content or just dont have extra time to do so. I have no problems with items that are very rare or hard to obtain, i just dont think they should base it off of something most people didnt know about until after it was over.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eisaderfrau</div><div class="date">2009-02-12, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you noticed the Brewfest club item, a new item, on your alt, and did not think even once to maybe get it on your main, too? Doing the half-daily ram runs on two characters isn't that time-consuming...<br />
<br />
<br />
No, I didn't as there was no in-game way for me to know about the meta achievement requiring this. This event was pre-Wrath, not post. And doing ram runs on my main for some beer had no appeal at all. I had made my ticket rounds the year before for the pet and keg. Doing it again for beer on another toon sounded, frankly, boring. I had better things to do. <br />
<br />
Blizzard will change this for this type of reason and for people who main switched to DK's. End of story. One year of doing all the required achievements for 7 world events, minus this one, is plenty for the reward. Basically, it shows that someone played the game regularly for at least 1/5th of the time the game has existed. If wrath had launched before Brewfest, I would obviously have no problem with this. It launched after, therefore this achievement is void for the purpose of the reward meta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can almost agree with this. What I have a problem with though, is Blizz rewarding QQ. It's like raising a child, if they get what they want by crying, they'll cry even harder next time. So even though I can see the point about the BotM achievement not being known ingame at the time, I'm afraid I'll lose the last bit of respect I have for Blizz if they give in to QQ yet again.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps blizzard had that in mind from the start, maybe they intend it to be a 2 year achievement with the exception of those few lucky/well informed who in the end will manage to complete it this brewfest - a number I bet will be much lower than most are guessing atm.</div></div><hr />

I'm just very angry about the abysmal droprate of this candy stuff for the present holydays and also about the PvP part of any meta achievement.

<br />
some call it QQ (or crying), others call it feedback. blizzard needs feedback to make the game better... it's not blizzard rewarding QQ, it's blizzard reacting to feedback and thus making the game better for everyone.<br />
<br />
we're not talking about a complex issue like class balance... i can't understand why people oppose to removing the achievement. blizzard punishs their customers for not reading mmo-champion carefully during the beta-phase of wotlk. it's stupid and demotivating.</div></div><hr />

Which would result in possibly even more people ending up with it next brewfest than the upcoming one. I got brew of the month on one of my characters, but not the other one that I ended up doing holiday achievements on because I didn't know anything about achievements until about a month later. And I looked in my achievement panel for brew of the year, and one of the drinks that I bought a lot did not register into the achievement. Which brings me to my point, there could be endless arguments about the meta. And although I would love to have my drake this year, its a game. I could deal with not having it for another. They said they &quot;currently&quot; have no plans to change it, so who knows what may or may not happen. Its not that big of a deal ::).</div></div><hr />

Yes, but you did notice the item &quot;Brew of the Month&quot; Club Membership Form (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37571) at the vendors, right? Even without the temptation of the achievement, an ingame club regarding beer, as it sounds even monthly, should've been enough.<br />
It's kinda as if you, during the, how long was it, week of WoW's 4th Anniversary (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2398), never logged in on your main's server, but played on another server, where your characters have the achievement and the bear. If you didn't go on your main's server even once, because you didn't realize it was an achievement (while this was after 3.0, at often times people did not actually see the achievement pop up when logging in), then it's your own fault.</div></div><hr />

If they intended it to be like this, that only some will get it this year, then they shouldn't have a problem making another sunwell for example, an instance that only some players will see, see where i'm getting at you idiot? If they don't remove this it would be against their new casual thing they got going and I very much doubt they will go with the old *50% content for casuals and 100% for hardcores. It has NOTHING to do with casuals QQing. I'm not a casual, not even alittle, but when the achievement wasn't even ingame yet when they implement the ONLY 1 year required achievement right after it's holiday is just stupid.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure from they way you type that you are one of the mega QQing players that QQ about everything like 10 man raids, content to easy even without having done it all, classes being OP etc, I bet that if you wouldn't have gotten this achievement you would have made the biggest QQ post in this thread.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do about caring, It shouldn't be required to be on the PTR and reading sites like mmo-champ to get an achievement. The problem is that it's the only 1 year required achievement ingame and that it was implemented right after brewfest was over. I know tons of so called 'hardcore* players and most of them don't have this achievement.</div></div><hr />

Yet you are the one QQing like a major crybaby. Feel free to find any QQing post made by me in the past, should keep you busy for hours before giving up.<br />

<br />
<br />
1. I also have the summon paladin, libram crap and always saved all my moonstones but what does that have to do with this?<br />
2. You're saying that everyone that didn't do BotM is lazy/unmotivated? thats just like saying that everyone that didn't do sunwell was lazy and didn't disserve to be there, and that is being an elitist jerk if i'm not misstaken. <br />
3. There are many druids out there that wants regular mounts since they can use it like everyone else maybe because they don't like the flightform.<br />
<br />
I like doing holiday events, some more then others and I like doing achievements, i'm not doing them simply cause of the mount that you claim, I would never really use the mount cause I rather have the ones from the raiding achievements and I know alot of players which is doing it for the same reasons as me. I usually do these event achievements with my friends and guildmembers for the fun of it.<br />
<br />
I know there are alot of players that do it just cause of the reward, thats their choice and giving everyone a fair chance is not hurting anything more then your ego since you clearly don't want others to be able to have same drake as you. And when you say that you don't care about the mount you wouldn't respond to this in the first place cause if you didn't care about it why are you so hostile against the players who do want it? How does it effect you if others get a mount that you don't want or care about?<br />
<br />
We're talking about 1 achievement here nothing more and the reason we're talking about it is because that it takes 1 year to do it. You can still do it since you're doing it for the fun of it, it's not like we're asking them to take it out of the game, we just want it out of the meta achievement.</div></div><hr />

So according to you it's not egocentric to say what you're saying, that players that didn't sit infront of their pc reading everything doesn't disserve it? It has nothing what so ever to do with *same amount of work but... uuuuuh it's not for causal if it's 2 years - yeah!&quot;* how is it more hardcore and disserving to start one achievement (not do but start it) and then getting a mail once a month?

When they want dedication and so on, why then remove the pet, or the masks?<br />
Why is ther only ONE 10 POINT achievment in 7 meta-achievment that delays the whole thing for a whole year?<br />
<br />
It's rather simple: Like so often one designer made an achievment without talking to his colleagues.<br />
And now they are claming they planned it that way to save face.<br />
We had that over and over in WoW.<br />
<br />
At last, they will change that because of thousands of players who didn't know about this achievment or didn't care about the Events before.<br />
<br />
You can't assume that every 11 mio. players read mmo-champion or another page which listed every single thing of the beta.<br />
<br />
This is nothing about work or dedication.<br />
<br />
I have done the Ambassador, working on the Loremaster and a lot more.<br />
I am doing it because it's fun.<br />
Because i like the titels for roleplaying and even for posing.<br />

<br />
No, he's saying people who noticed the Membership form but didn't acquire it had no real interest in the event, but oh so suddenly complained once it was tied to an achievement, which rewards a shiny mount.<br />
<br />

You're saying that everyone that didn't do BotM is lazy/unmotivated? thats just like saying that everyone that didn't do sunwell was lazy and didn't disserve to be there, and that is being an elitist jerk if i'm not misstaken.It's not that they were lazy, it's that they didn't put everything in to get there. I didn't go to SWP myself pre 3.0 because my guild is maybe somewhat too lenient about raiders which saps PvE competitivity (we didn't go further than tries on RoS before 3.0) and i had no intention of quitting said guild just to see Sunwell (because other things were more important to me). It's not really about deserving to go there or not, i could have by applying to better guilds, i didn't out of my own volition, so i didn't see it in it's unnerfed state.<br />
But the main point would be that i never QQ about it.<br />
<br />
BotM on the other hand is an easy thing to get. People who didn't try to get the ticket to the club didn't care enough about the event to &quot;complete&quot; it (or maybe bad luck due to holidays/trips/work/...). Which isn't good or bad in itself, it's anyones choice. But now that there's a reward (outside of the effects from the beer) there are tons of people QQing about it.<br />
And yes, i find that lazy and hypocritical : most of them started to care about it only after learning about the existence of the drake. Difficult to pretend they are doing it for the fun of the events under such circumstances.<br />
<br />
The reason i'm answering is not because i'm jealous of other people getting something that only my special self should get (as an example, i'm still wearing my Shattered Sun title instead of any of the ~15 others because it's the one i prefer) but because i dislike this trying to pressure Blizzard in giving in to QQ (as a symptom of a dangerous behavior from users).<br />
<br />
Let's be honest, hadn't i done BotM i'd be happy if Blizzard ended up removing it from the meta. However, you'd never see me on forums trying to demand from Blizzard and using whatever justification as to &quot;this isn't fair, QQ, my mount&quot;. If i didn't get it this year, i'd do it the next one and that's that.</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt mind if it required you to become a member but to have to taste every brew every month is pathetic and stupid. Its not casual to do the achievements for these meta achievements. So far from the 4 world events I have personally done. Love is in the Air has been the easist. And by far children's week is going to suck the worst. Its full of pvp achievements and for a pve mage this is going to suck for me. But on another note I doubt they will keep the membership in its current status as a meta achievement due to the fact its the only achievement on the meta list that requires year around participation.

As another poster said, if this is about dedication and a special mount that has 310% speed and is supposed to be rare: Leave the mask for all occasions and the perma peddle or the black dress in. If 1 extra year for the brewfest is fine, then you have this extra year for another Love is in the air and another Hallow Eve...And add the noblegarden too.<br />

<br />
Since starting WoW i've enjoyed the festivities at world events very much, yet i didn't enjoy every aspect of it. at brewfest '08 i did every quest once and from the rewards i bought myself a nice brewfest hat and some ale, but i had no interest in doing the quests more than once. i didn't like the brewfest mounts, so i didn't farm them thorougly, just three or four times. the thought of getting a botm membership didn't cross my mind. a beer per month? spend my coins for such a crap? i rather want some decent clothings, hell yeah!<br />
<br />
but now i suddenly feel _punished_ by blizzard for not getting a crappy membership at botm and flamed by guys like you for being _lazy_ about it, just because i'd like to get a purple protodrake after hearing about it.<br />

the fact is: noone can be blamed for not getting a botm membership, yet blizzard can be blamed for including the boty achievement into the meta achievement.</div></div><hr />
