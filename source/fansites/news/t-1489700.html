We’ve been hard at work on World of Warcraft®: Warlords of Draenor™, and today we’ve entered the Alpha phase of our expansion testing. As part of this, we’ll begin using public servers to host the data, which means you may begin seeing some datamined information show up in the usual places.<br />
<br />
One of our goals for this very early stage of the Alpha is to test out some new technology in the wild with employees and friends and family, including a new file format called CASC (more on that below). As such, the expansion content available during this first phase will be quite limited—many of the expansion’s major features, such as Garrisons, won’t be available until a later point in the testing process. This early phase of testing will help us ramp up for our larger beta phase later on, when we’ll be inviting more players.<br />
<br />
Introducing Our New File Format: CASC<br />
For nearly 20 years, Blizzard games have used a file format called Mo’PaQ (MPQ for short) as a way to compress and store game files. We’ve been able to introduce some great new technology using MPQ, such as our streaming client, but we’ve really pushed the file format far beyond what it was ever intended to be used for. Today, it’s become the source of a number of technical limitations for World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
To address these limitation and help us develop new technologies that will improve everyone’s game experience for years to come, we’re introducing a new proprietary file format that we call CASC (Content Addressable Storage Container). We’ll be using this new format in the Warlords of Draenor alpha and beta tests, and our intent is to convert everyone to the new format in a pre-expansion patch.<br />
<br />
As geeky as it may sound, we’re extremely excited to be moving to this new file format. It provides a ton of benefits not only for us and our ability to support and patch the game, but also for players. Here are just a few of the benefits of the new CASC file format:<br />
<br />
<br />
File Corruption - File repair tools are a thing of the past. The file structure maintains itself, helping to prevent errors during installation.<br />
Speed - Real-world game performance should increase for many players thanks to a non-redundant file structure[/b] - in layman’s terms, the game can find the assets it’s looking for more quickly.<br />
Patching - Updating your game files should be faster and more reliable. Patch data is integrated seamlessly, and no longer requires double the installation size on-disk when patching.<br />
Client Hotfixing - CASC allows us to be able to hotfix client game data, similar to server hotfixes, giving us the ability to address client-side issues that would normally require a patch.<br />
Streaming - The new format provides better support for streaming data and gives us greater flexibility to define how content updates are delivered and released.<br />
Expandable - The file structure is built to allow easy integration of new technologies in the future that we haven’t even thought up yet.<br />
. . . and more!<br />
<br />
<br />
We’re already using this file format for Heroes of the Storm’s Technical Alpha test, and we’re looking forward to reaping its benefits for WoW. As we mentioned, the first big step in transitioning all WoW players over will be converting everyone’s World of Warcraft installs to the new file format prior to the expansion. Our goal is to make sure that’s as seamless and painless a changeover as possible, using as much of the existing installed data as possible to reduce additional downloads. We’ll have more info on the file conversion process as we get closer to the launch of Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
Signing Up for Beta<br />
We’re still early in the Alpha testing process, but if you’re interested in opting in for a chance to participate in the Warlords of Draenor beta test later down the line, let us know you’re interested by creating a beta profile. To do so, log in to your Battle.net® account, go to Beta Profile Settings to download and run the Battle.net System Check tool, and submit (or update) your computer’s specifications. From the Beta Profile menu, make sure that Warcraft is checked, and update your beta preferences. You’re now eligible to be randomly selected for a Warlords of Draenor beta invite at a later stage of the testing process.<br />
<br />
Account Security Reminder<br />
As interest grows for the upcoming Warlords of Draenor expansion, please be aware of phishing attempts. Unscrupulous individuals (possibly working for the Iron Horde) may send out falsified emails purporting to be from Blizzard, but are in fact meant to steal your login credentials. For more information on how to identify these emails please refer to our Battle.net® Account Security site.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for more information as development and testing progresses for Warlords of Draenor™. This is just the beginning and we’ll have more information to share with you in the near future!<br />

Haha ladies and gentlemen, a prime example of someone who would rather see rushed content instead of quality content. Give a round of applause to this guy for being ignorant towards what kind of work has to be done in order to make a game decent.</div></div><hr />

The constant bitching about how slow they are, and when they offer you up an amazing piece of progress towards the expansion, most of you react by shitting on them more. <br />
<br />
Previous Alpha phases have lasted 4 to 7 weeks and a less limited Beta is pretty soon to follow after that, in most cases. <br />
<br />
Skip the Alpha? Why? So you people can fucking complain that it isn't polished enough when it goes to beta? <br />
Get with the program, These games don't just shit themselves out. Bunch of fucking mouth breathers. <br />

<br />
Well the process of F&amp;F Alpha -&gt; Beta is going to happen as it's mentioned in the blue post.. so I'm guessing Lore is referring to a shorter testing period this time around. Which I suppose is possible due to the lack of new class or race. Maybe they've done more internal testing this time too.</div></div><hr />

The constant bitching about how slow they are, and when they offer you up an amazing piece of progress towards the expansion, most of you react by shitting on them more. <br />

Previous Alpha phases have lasted 4 to 7 weeks and a less limited Beta is pretty soon to follow after that, in most cases. <br />

So you'd rather they rush it and be broken instead?

Well yeah, I assume dataminers will need to get used to the new format before they can really dig deep. It is worth noting that Heroes of the Storm uses the new format too and people datamine it just fine.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has had a long time to work on it since then so saying we'll be in MoP for 10 months onthe soel purpose of an Alpha announcement would be rather silly. If it's in alpha, it's probably a late alpha (but still an overall early version of the game) that wont last for too long before beta. It's more than likely they are just keeping us in the dark atm which isn't too outlandish when it comes to blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has had a long time to work on it since then so saying we'll be in MoP for 10 months onthe soel purpose of an Alpha announcement would be rather silly. If it's in alpha, it's probably a late alpha (but still an overall early version of the game) that wont last for too long before beta. It's more than likely they are just keeping us in the dark atm which isn't too outlandish when it comes to blizzard.<br />

What you had there wasn't exactly WoD alpha... was more a current 5.4 with shrink, new models and effects and a seriously limited early leveling experience for one new map. No new systems, no Garrisons, nothing that will be the real deal for implementing and working on. Things that would be really going alpha testing. Blizzcon was far from alpha testing... more like a &quot;demo&quot; to &quot;show&quot;.</div></div><hr />

People seem to forget that Development takes a long time. The Alpha stage, either internal or external, means there is a workable product. Alpha's are intended to test the major mechanics and systems in the game, not all the bells and whistles. No one is testing it publicly yet, not the media or friends and family. Thats what the announcement is in parallel with the new framework. So do not fool yourself and think you will see a fully fleshed out game in the Alpha stage.<br />
<br />
That said, Blizzard is pretty good about having workable copies and I would not expect it to be long before they start calling it a Beta. I am personally excited to see the new system and how that will work out. WOW is one of the longest running, definitely the most successful, MMORPG's ever released and for good reason. Blizzard is all about the polish and fine tuning and making sure they release a game better then any other competitor. Are there any left out there that have not already gone free to play? Are there any others out there where the Developers actually listen to their players and make changes to the game based on those suggestions or needs?<br />
<br />
In the end, you choose to play. You want to see something better, then send them a suggestion with a constructive solution.</div></div><hr />

Nothing says &quot;pure awesomeness&quot; like instances and raids bugged to impossibility, right?</div></div><hr />

Blizzard wants to get this expansion right for once, so they aren't taking their time any more than they are taking precautions. Calm down folks - blind hate gets us no where, and neither do logical fallacies.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure ALL expansions had an alpha - it's stupid not to. It's just that this time due to them strongly indicating that this expansion was further along than previous ones had been, they made us think WoD was coming earlier in the year and then dumped it back to later in the year. The problem is basically too long final tier and the feeling (accurate or not) that WoD has been delayed. This makes the alpha seem more &quot;visible&quot; than previous expansion. The biggest thing really is that WoD has been a bit of a PR disaster.<br />

<br />
Judging from past alphas of past expacs it's about 6 months from release so, October...<br />
<br />
So depressing knowing that we're only HALFWAY thru SoO.. WTF<br />
<br />
I predict November - mainly because I don't think they can get it done before then and I also think they will be VERY keen to be able to release it before the &quot;latest date&quot; they published. Ultimately though.... what we think about when it's released is like throwing dice in the air and seeing where they land.... we will know, when we know.<br />

They said that was the worst-case scenario date, are you new?<br />

Read more carefully.... he (or she) clearly said &quot;or earlier&quot;.<br />

<br />
it's not `F&amp;F` alpha it's a `public` one, that mean it's a bit far more in development<br />
and it's going to be without NDA, so guess they give up on it with such leakers and dataminers around, so ye expect lots of info..<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure about that tbh: &quot;One of our goals for this very early stage of the Alpha is to test out some new technology in the wild with employees and friends and family&quot;. SOUNDS very much like F&amp;F to me!<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
And MoPaQ worked just fine for the last 9 years. There is some ulterior motive to switching to the new format. IF it aint broke dont fix it.<br />
<br />
Maybe... it &quot;works&quot; ok - but it just too slow a format to keep up with the changes to the game? It causes fps issues when your computer cannot decode it fast enough? etc etc. All kinds of reasons to change to a new file format. How many times has NTFS been updated since it was first used in Windows NT for example?<br />

This is what people need to notice <br />
<br />
&quot;Alpha&quot; is just what we're calling the start of our public testing period this time around.<br />
as quoted by lore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which tbh is just standard Blizzard &quot;non-speak&quot;. Alpha is just what they are calling it...... is because that is what it is. Saying it this way - a very Blizzard like way - just tries to obfuscate what is really happening, although not by much as they have clearly defined it as employees and friends and family. So basically just a normal F&amp;F Alpha. Nothing surprising here however.</div></div><hr />
