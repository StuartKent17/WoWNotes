Also if anyone watched the MMO-Report, Metzen said that the WarCraft movie may not be Canon, in which case I will pretty much kill every single human being at Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Oh well, it sort of fits with the Grim Batol theme anyhow. Let's wait for the shiny weapons we get from other places.<br />
<br />
<br />
And MMO-report is several weeks late with most of their information, as per usual. And his attempts at being funny are terrible.</div></div><hr />

I thought Dagger 1 and Dagger 2 were the coolest looking of the bunch of weapons. But Dagger 3 was kind of over the top.</div></div><hr />

I doubt Thunderfury will make a reappearance, as it wasn't actually Al'alkir's weapon, though I wouldn't be surprised (or disappointed) to see a homage to it... here's hoping for more models, and soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand the Axes do look like Axes. I would just like to leave the feeling that it would be more awesome if the char model could hold the weapon in a lower position. Seems to me that would create an 'optical ilusion' that would make the wep 'bigger'</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am guessing the theme won't persist throughout Cataclysm, because if you think about it, every weapon model there looks like it could quite possibly be wielded by a member of the Twilight Hammer. There's no room for any dragons inside of the Grim Batol raid, all of the rooms and hallways are fairly small, so I'm guessing it's going to be mostly fighting elementals and twilight hammer cultists in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yay the game world has been updated ( but now its even more cartoony), but the character models, the thing that supposedly defines &quot;you&quot; in the game are dated as hell. With the lack of detail / poly count / texture size we're going to see the same 4-5 combinations of &quot;looks&quot; for the armor and it'll just be entirely samey. and that is IF blizzard even bothers to make &quot;new&quot; stuff, they are notorious for palette swaps and adding 1-2 polys here and a horn/spike there and calling it &quot;new&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Didn't see that it was 2-handed axe and 2-handed sword. They are really small :-\. Please Blizzard make some bigger weapons. Even if a weapon have great design and it's size is small, it makes the weapon look bland and boring.</div></div><hr />

I miss the days where every weapon had his different model. It's lame.... and i'm worried they will do the same with tier... Warrior tier will have his skin, off set tanking plate will have the same skin as Warrior's but different colour... sad.<br />

<br />
I agree with this. they should make all different specs have different gear.</div></div><hr />

A f*cking bat spread on a giant toothstick looks really weird. Besides, doublebladed axes often look really alien and, sadly, it is something Blizzard seem to be fond of at the moment.<br />
<br />
Gorehowl, Ramaldini blade of culling, Betrayer of humanity were all good designs while things like the dual-blade butcher or mooncleaver doesn't look like a war axe at all…<br />
<br />
Also, the Grim Batol raid 2H models seem too small (I like 2H swords but they have the same size than 1H)…</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZenX</div><div class="date">2010-05-10, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya'll are crazy. These weapon models, just like the character models, are too simplistic and bland.<br />
<br />
Yay the game world has been updated ( but now its even more cartoony), but the character models, the thing that supposedly defines &quot;you&quot; in the game are dated as hell. With the lack of detail / poly count / texture size we're going to see the same 4-5 combinations of &quot;looks&quot; for the armor and it'll just be entirely samey. and that is IF blizzard even bothers to make &quot;new&quot; stuff, they are notorious for palette swaps and adding 1-2 polys here and a horn/spike there and calling it &quot;new&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Upgrade your graphics card along with your display and play the game at high graphics, then you'll recognize texture quality, if you tend to state you can't then please don't complain about the graphics quality.<br />
<br />
I like the new weapon models, they fit well with the concept of the raid and I'm okay with it as long as each respective weapon model is classified in terms of the spec that will use it(caster and melee at the least) rather than recoloring.</div></div><hr />

But still, GB 2-handed weapons need to be bigger, and 2-handed weapons should be bigger in general. The 2-handed axe and sword looks like 1-handers. People won't enjoy them. Blizzard just need to increase the size and we are fine. <br />
<br />
And Blizzard should really leave the ICC weapons design and ICC raid feeling alone, some weapons really look like they belong in ICC, there is a rune-dagger in GB ::). ICC needs to stay unique, it was Arthas' last showdown.</div></div><hr />

I do agree with this though, despite any other posts I've made. As much as these weapons kindof match the Grim Batol raid, it being full of Twilight Hammer cultists and all, I'm hoping the rest of the expansion's design will move away from this sortof aesthetic.</div></div><hr />

Personally I think the weaps look really cool. They are obviously themed to tie in with all the Twilight's Hammer stuff that we have seen so far, and they look pretty sweet tbh. I particularly like the staff, the axes and swords. Good work, Blizz.<br />

Ok, the weapon models angles and design are straight out of the Awesome bin. The textures however should be planted back into the mud or made into a nice Water basin, or rock garden.<br />

WHAT is with all the Swords and Daggers and fist weapons, and maces, staves, axes and some clothing Looking like it was carved out a mountain side!! <br />
its a trend that started in Woltk, and apparently being carried on though Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
I really miss the day when a sword looked like some sort of metal, refined from some sort of rock rather than blizz saying Eh, we know the ore is in there lets just carve the rock into a weapon shape.<br />

Wake up boy, you do realize most of the loot that blizzard is implanting is related to the instance right?

I strongly agree with that. Hopefully Deathwing's loot will have lava dripping down on majority of the items. Caster items? Perhaps a berserking enchant look to it, but with a slight more glow. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol this newspost is great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really thought it was better when they had a clear theme related to the dungeon or raid. BWL weapons have the most awesome looking models and textures as a whole set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still not loving the staves though, or the fact that they use same models and different colours.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll just keep my Origin of Nightmares and my Staff of the Forest Lord in my bank :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
I prefered Vanilla WoW style, where Armor looked like armor, not like Anime Christmas Tree, and weapons looked like weapons, not like weapons molded by Edward Scissorhands.<br />
<br />
Arcanite Reaper, Krol Blade, Maladath Runed Blade of Black Flight, Warblade of Hakkri, Dark Edge of Insanity, Nightfall, Drake Talon Cleaver, Sulfuras Hand of Ragnaros, Herald of Woe, Ashkandi greatsword of brotherhood, The Untamed Blade...<br />
<br />
Go ahead, look them up, if you want to see how weapons should be designed, because now with each expansion we are drifting away from Western Fantasy WoW was in Vanilla to the Eastern Anime Fantasy (althou I must admit wotlk wasn't so bad), the Burning Crusade was awful (with the exceptions), now I see we will get more of Burning Crusade with Grim Batol in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
ps. t0,5 is still my favorite one, but 0,5 with 1 and 2 are the BEST LOOKING ARMOR TIERS EVER.</div></div><hr />

Wake up boy, you do realize most of the loot that blizzard is implanting is related to the instance right? If you want a weapon that looks the complete opposite of the instance, please play Maplestory. You're going to be one sad panda if you're ever paying for next expansion. Oh yeah you've to pay.<br />
<br />
<br />
ok, but if all the weapons look like they were Chiseled from the back of a rock titan, in this next expansion I would like to state for the record that I dislike this style of art.<br />
which is just my opinion, and it may be in artistic reference to Grim Batol, however if everything looks like that I will send you a message with a huge ogre hand of a /slap in return! XD</div></div><hr />

I mean the stuff's kind of cool, but it just reminds of me PvP gear for some reason.<br />
PvP gear with bright colors.<br />
<br />
However being that this expansion's main focus seems to be on PvP I'm actually more excited to see what the PvP gear is going to look like.<br />
Though I hate PvP</div></div><hr />

Yep this basically sums it up. Models are fine, there is nothing inherently WRONG with them (as taste is subjective).<br />

And I have seen plenty of blades / weapons made out of darker materials.<br />

Just a darker metal.<br />

How many weapons can really drop out of there, anyways? The T11 weapons are going to be spread around Skywall, Firelands, Grim Batol, and Blackwing Descent, so many of those models may just be used once, and then a recolor for the heroic version, especially since 10/25 is going to be dropping the same weapons. It's standard to make recolors like that, there's hundreds of model recolors in the game database that have never been used. Don't get what people are so worked up about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Star Wars looks like shit tho.<br />

Blizzard said somewhere that you could see on the items what raid they were from.<br />

what are you talking about !! that Model is original, and it looks more like a slim pineapple if you ask me. lol but point is it has character! It makes you laugh, or it makes you I know don feel like you could belong to some pineapple worshiping tribe of pigmys, but it makes you think about it. this new crap is just dull and boring, and it might have a glow here and there. but that's about it, there is nothing interesting about them at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, of the three weapons you posted, only one was actually reused during vanilla WoW. The spear and axe weren't reused until TBC, except as an epic in the DM tribute run (axe). Meanwhile, Dagger #1 in particular seems disturbingly similar to http://www.wowhead.com/item=38242#same-model-as, while Dagger #2 immediately brings to mind http://www.wowhead.com/item=45078#same-model-as.</div></div><hr />

I won't lie, some of the weapons in Vanilla - GM Claymore and Dark Edge of Insanity immediately come to mind - had amazing designs, but it was not the delightful land of wonderfulness people make it out to be, that was mostly my point. And we'll likely see more of that draconic style in say... Blackwing Descent. Grim Batol is more about the Twilight Hammer than actual dragons, even though there's still a dragon motif.</div></div><hr />

So sure, Vanilla shared some models, generic shields, wands, caster weapons... but using one extreme to &quot;disprove&quot; vanilla vs. all the unique models (and better looking than most WOTLK and these shitty Cata raid weapons), vanilla had a lot of uniqueness, TBC sort of (lame arena/pve recolors) &gt;:\</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that was my bad. The others I linked, however, were fair game. :P Many of the weapons in AQ also shared models with the 20man AQ Ruins, however, and really, almost everything that didn't drop off of C'thun was... hideous.</div></div><hr />

But I still don't like this road Blizzard is going down, back in BC and Vanilla a really good weapon stood out, you could tell without inspecting the person what it was. Now, with all these recolors, nothing is unique or interesting anymore. Everybody looks the same, all gear looks the same.<br />
<br />
But I guess I should hold my judgment until the expansion actually drops.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dare</div><div class="date">2010-05-10, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are those crossbows or beat sticks? Maybe melee hunters will be viable!<br />
<br />
Joke aside, the weapons do look interesting, but I do see a Wotlk theme, somewhat.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oziriz</div><div class="date">2010-05-10, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so I guess comparing current gen weapons to Vanilla is kinda hard, seeing that current raids have 4 different versions/modes. So you can't expect them to make different models for every version/mode. The different color versions are good idea, but not good enough. It doesn't give a good impression of what version/mode your gear/weapon actually is.<br />
<br />
Back in the day, someone would walk around with Ashkandi and you would immediately know omfg that guy has that sword, from that boss, he is awesome. Right now you see a weapon and you can't really tell from what version it is.<br />
<br />
So my suggestion to blizzard is, at least make a difference between normal and heroic mode. Maybe make the heroic version an upgraded version of the normal one, giving it a glow and adding more to the weapon/gear. So that people can actually see the difference.<br />
<br />
Non the less, the weapons look nice, but not super special!</div></div><hr />

Don't. Everything will look the same like it did in WOTLK. To be honest, I don't really mind all that much. I don't mind looking the same as everyone else. As long as I think the gear looks good, I don't mind if 50,000 others are wearing it too. <br />
<br />
You know sometimes I get gear and wear it for the looks rather than the stats? It's all just for the fun of playing WoW! I don't take gear very seriously, probably another reason I don't raid.</div></div><hr />

I mean, the vanilla and tbc weapon models where something that made my eyes bleed honey; not over detailed but simplified models..and most importantly; they were BIGGER back then (well atleast 2H weapons) and as we all know: BIG GUNS &gt; BABY GUNS<br />
<br />
dunno is the size that is shown in those pictures the same as it should be, but aww comon, the 2H weapons and 1H ones are exactly same sized! I cant stop asking from myself &quot;why???&quot;. <br />

I can't actually think of a comeback to that.I won't lie, some of the weapons in Vanilla - GM Claymore and Dark Edge of Insanity immediately come to mind - had amazing designs, but it was not the delightful land of wonderfulness people make it out to be, that was mostly my point. And we'll likely see more of that draconic style in say... Blackwing Descent. Grim Batol is more about the Twilight Hammer than actual dragons, even though there's still a dragon motif.<br />

The unique models and designs largely outweigh the recycled items, and this is just from Blackwing Lair. Also, pretty much any weapon from Naxxramas40.<br />

At no point did I try to claim that there weren't unique models, or no good models. Not only that, but at that point, there as only one version of a raid that they had to create weapons for; Blackwing Lair has a grand total of 28 weapons.<br />
ICC has 68, and that's if you don't include the heroic mode. If you, say, only took the 10man mode, or only the 25man, very few of them would be sharing models either.</div></div><hr />

That's not the position you seemed to be taking earlier in the thread, but I digress.<br />
<br />
If we were to compact something like Icecrown Citadel into a single raid like Blackwing Lair, Blackwing Lair's weapons would still have more flare/flavor than ICC's. The fact that we are even comparing early pre-BC raid equipment designs to the final Wrath of the Lich King raid instance's equipment should make you question where the creativity has gone. Especially when you consider how WoW was making nowhere near the money it is today. One of the few weapons in ICC that actually has some &quot;pop&quot; to it is Bryntoll (http://www.wowhead.com/item=50415).<br />
<br />
That's the point I'm making.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiwi.cozy</div><div class="date">2010-05-10, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some very nice designs for the weapons, but the thing that bothers me is...

<br />
I prefered Vanilla WoW style, where Armor looked like armor, not like Anime Christmas Tree, and weapons looked like weapons, not like weapons molded by Edward Scissorhands.<br />
<br />
Arcanite Reaper, Krol Blade, Maladath Runed Blade of Black Flight, Warblade of Hakkri, Dark Edge of Insanity, Nightfall, Drake Talon Cleaver, Sulfuras Hand of Ragnaros, Herald of Woe, Ashkandi greatsword of brotherhood, The Untamed Blade...<br />
<br />
Go ahead, look them up, if you want to see how weapons should be designed, because now with each expansion we are drifting away from Western Fantasy WoW was in Vanilla to the Eastern Anime Fantasy (althou I must admit wotlk wasn't so bad), the Burning Crusade was awful (with the exceptions), now I see we will get more of Burning Crusade with Grim Batol in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
ps. t0,5 is still my favorite one, but 0,5 with 1 and 2 are the BEST LOOKING ARMOR TIERS EVER.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stop talking about the past. Especially telling the designers how to design makes you look more stupid. If you really don't like what they're doing just cancel your account while you're at it. They're matching the dungeons scenery. If you look at the weapons and compare the dungeons to it; they're the same.<br />
<br />
I hate when people talk about the damn past. All they're doing is improving game play. If you look at the old expansion you'll realize how over-sized crap was and still is. Also, lets not forget how easy everything was if you actually pay attention to the phases. All you needed was more people. For example MC 40m, it was just like EQ if you really want to compare a game. The only reason why it felt more difficult; A LOT OF PEOPLE NEEDED TO GET CARRIED. Gear was harder to obtain since the quantity was very little compare to the group size.</div></div><hr />

I agree 100%, they lost their flavor for design in WOTLK, I am hoping these weapons are just sort of bland to contrast with the awesome weapons in the other raid instances... we'll see but I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Criticism is a good thing for designers of course. The models reflect the dungeon/raid they come from. It makes sense from a design standpoint. The reason why weapons looked so unique back in the day also was becasue there weren't weapons for every spec and class, now there is, people wanted viability from every spec both in PvE and PvP, they got it and the weapons/gear suffered a little. There is not much you can do. Blizzard could hire 100 more people to make unique shit for every class. but do you want to pay an extra 5$ a month?</div></div><hr />

The designs aren't bad in the first place. If you actually obtain any of the gear that you even see there. You'll have a awe feeling regardless of the matter. Do you expect something shiny to come out of something ugly? As long if the game is fun; i'm enjoying my time on WoW. It's more harder to have a flare on the weapons now. If you was to compare Vanilla to any other expansion. You'll see they had more time to make something appealing. Every class usually had a exclusive role. <br />
<br />
Less roles = better designed gear = more time to spare <br />
<br />
They're fixing the problem. Please don't jump to a conclusion just yet.</div></div><hr />

The mallet wasn't a weapon until some time in TBC...<br />

Aah, my bad. I didn't make the connection that it hadn't actually been an equipped weapon before that point. I never much liked ZF and have always steered clear of it.</div></div><hr />

I'm not the guy that says &quot;if you don't like the new weapon models just quit the game&quot;, but let's be realistic here.<br />
<br />
Any reading of the comments here yields the following: <br />
<br />
1) A good chunk of people like the models. <br />
2) Another good chunk of people like some of the models<br />
3) A good chunk of people think the models should be more &quot;fantastic&quot; and/or &quot;creative&quot; (which I'm reading roughly the same). Essentially they think the models are boring and should be more &quot;awesome&quot;<br />
4) Another good chunk of people think the models should be more realistic and look more like actual weapons. <br />
5) A final chunk of people dislike the new models for reasons that are undefinable. Either they didn't say, or they used words so vague as to be useless. <br />
<br />
So realistically there is no possible way that Blizzard can make all of these people happy. Some of what they want is in diametric opposition to what others want. Some will whine no matter what because they either like to whine or think Blizzard has already ruined the game beyond repair, so nothing that gets done is as good as it used to be. This is what blizzard has to work with. Are you shocked that you aren't getting exactly what you want out of a design, when they are trying to please 11 *million* people?<br />
<br />
If you want to criticize, that's certainly your right. Feel free. Be prepared for disappointment. Your words are not likely to have much affect. If Blizzard could manage to please any more than a quarter of their population with a new design they've managed an amazing job.</div></div><hr />

Who knows... who cares. 8D No, on the serious side, we don't know what they're made out of. Maybe they look like they're made of stone, but they're not? *shrug* I'd like a bit of an explanation myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Max Settings 1920x1200 @ 4x AA/AF on a 24' , 4870 ( waiting to get 5870 after I can afford an eyefinity setup). They still look like shit. Increasing the settings / resolution only makes the dated graphics more apparent.<br />
<br />
doesn't matter what resolution you run at, 40poly models w/ 100x100 textures sizes still stay exactly the same. The stuff looks like trash compared to other MMO's let alone other modern games, and there is no reason for it.

<br />
It comes down to developer management and what they think is best for the game. I somewhat agree with what you're saying, but this early in the development of Cataclysm you really shouldn't criticize things until we have more of an idea of how they may turn out. You also really need to realize how much time they're putting into other things in this game that are more important. And I'm sorry you feel this way about the weapon models, but they should be very low on the totem pole of things they're working on for Cataclysm, especially when the majority of players won't even see them. It has nothing to do with low creativity, just management of their developer's times and overall it's understandable in such a vast game. And assuming that their 'poor quality' in terms of weapon/gear design is simply due to a lack of creativity you're very unaware of what it takes to run this game.</div></div><hr />
