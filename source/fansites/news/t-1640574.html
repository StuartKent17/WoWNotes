<br />
Master Plan Addon<br />
Today we are taking a look at some addons to make garrison mission management easier, starting with Master Plan (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/master-plan). <br />
<br />
<br />
Sorts the missions list so that missions that can be fully countered by idle followers are on top.<br />
Shows the number of followers, number of bonus XP, and if each threat can be countered or not. <br />
Mousing over a threat shows which followers can counter it. If a follower that can counter it is on a mission, the time until they are back is displayed.<br />
The followers list displays how many followers you have that can counter each ability, allowing you to see which ones you are missing or have too many of at a glance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-MPAddon&quot;&gt; http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/november/thumb/mpAddon04.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/november/mpAddon04.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/november/thumb/mpAddon02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/november/mpAddon02.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/november/thumb/mpAddon03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/november/mpAddon03.jpg) &lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrison Mission Manager Addon<br />
Next up is the Garrison Mission Manager (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/garrison-mission-manager) addon. This addon adds three buttons to the mission follower section screen, adding pre-defined groups that optimize for:<br />
<br />
<br />
Success rate<br />
Garrison resources<br />
Bonus XP<br />
Reduced mission duration<br />
<br />
<br />
There are also several planned features listed that will make follower selection even easier. If you installed this addon previously, make sure it is up to date, as earlier versions had a significant performance issue. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Challenge Mode Exploits<br />
Weâ€™re aware of some abuses and are addressing them. To be clear, anyone who finds external buffs that they can use to their advantage in Challenge Modes are going to at the very least have their times, achievements, and items stripped. It's not something anyone is going to get away with, and just isn't worth trying to.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
Are Drov the Ruiner and Tarlna the Ageless already up on gorgrond?<br />
As I mentioned in the Wednesday Q&amp;A, Drov and Tarlna will begin to spawn once Highmaul is open. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/533764240885030912))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
New server matches have been pushed for Ashran in the NA/EU. You must leave/re-enter Ashran to see the effects. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/535641802842189825))<br />
<br />
The blue PvP gear that drops from skirmishes &amp; bg's has 660 ilvl while the one you can buy has 675, is this intended?<br />
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/533114654143152128))<br />
<br />
this cross realm faction balancing we were told Ashran would have doesn't seem to work.<br />
We'll be refining it over the next few weeks. Hard to anticipate server participation in advance. Also some bugs. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/535101735786651649))<br />
<br />
BG rewarded drops have a change to be warforged, is this intended, hopeing conquest gear cant be warforged?<br />
It is intended. Conquest gear cannot be warforged. Nice longtail bonus for the bg player. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/535641037406887936))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
So is Azeroth Velen still alive?<br />
yes! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/534094861394141184))<br />
<br />
Was Admrial Taylor killed just so the horde could get something for Nazgrim dying? Feels horrible to loose yet another ally hero.<br />
We don't think about character deaths like that, rather do what fits and is meaningful for the story. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/534399121860210688))<br />
<br />
Lore question, is Teron'Gor dead at the end of auchidoun? Cause, he just seems to fall off the edge like team rocket blasting off<br />
The fact that we haven't found his body is disturbing. Stay tuned! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/535185006222913537))<br />
<br />
World<br />
Can we get the rare spawns to drop garrison resources once a week after they're killed once? I'd love to have a reason to hunt<br />
This is the intent behind the endgame rares, and there are many endgame POIs (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/533360029902974976))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Can followers be rerolled with the training certificate and get the Bodyguard trait? I'd love to have a bodyguard Ziri'ak!<br />
No, bodyguard is specific to a few followers, because it grants them person-specific abilities and bonuses. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/533684013722910721))<br />
<br />
I suppose you can answer this, is it intentional that salvage yard level 3 keeps giving me level 20+ greens? If so that sucks D:<br />
the salvage yard loot is SUPER ULTRA random. Level 3 will give you a better pool, but yeah, it contains... LOTS of things. LOTS. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/535907151407902720))<br />
Sometimes I get nothing though... That makes me sad <br />
You should always get something, though some things (like currency) may only appear in your chatbox. Not the case? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/535912506976260096))<br />

<br />
That would make sense if this site was dedicated specifically to spoilers, but it's not. There's a wealth of information here most of which are completely unrelated to spoilers/lore. Typically spoilers are handled well, with spoiler tags, that's why the black box exists. This one, however, was not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're skimming the Lore section for changes to the game mechanics?<br />
<br />
This really seems like user error.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
It was user error. Like I said, I skimmed it. I didn't even see the &quot;lore&quot; headlight because I was reading the PVP section. Underneath I saw the Faction leader's name. It's like a buzzword, it caught my eye unfortunately.<br />
<br />
If there was a spoiler tag, I wouldn't have been so careless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That isn't a reasonable expectation. The expansion isn't that old, so there are going to be players that have yet to reach a story point. It is not fair to tell them to cut themselves off from the rest of the community.<br />
<br />
Edit: Alayea, you forgot to log out. For everyone else, this is Aliok.</div></div><hr />

Whiny? Not really. Just someone who doesn't enjoy spoilers. Entitled? Bit of a stretch.<br />

<br />
Yeah right. Nobody found Taylor's death meaningful. It was one of the most anticlimactic and dumb deaths they've ever done.<br />
<br />
It was obviously done just to balance out the Horde losing Nazgrim, because the Alliance can't ever have something the Horde doesn't, even if Kosak won't admit it.</div></div><hr />

Some of us have lives and dont play 24/7 like you ya saddo,some people cant even afford the expansion yet and many many other reasons,stop thinking that just because an expansion is out everyone is going to burn to 100 like a sad no hoper!</div></div><hr />

That QR code addon is useless to me. I don't have a camera phone and if I want it on me at work, I can't have a camera. That's why I haven't upgraded from an iPhone 3GS yet. 4S and up has that front camera that's not as easy to disable like the back one.<br />

<br />
Unless I'm terribly mistaken, Taylor may be physically dead, but hes still around helping out the alliance. Or did I not see him as an alliance garrison follower? I certainly don't get a ghost Nazgrim. <br />
<br />
Orgrimm Doomhammer died at the same time as Maarad. Ga'Nar, Durotan's brother, dies in good old fashioned Battle of Thermopylae style. Then there's our insane former Warchief, you know, the one that caused you Alliance bastards to invade our hometown for over a year. He's dead now too. We also lost alot of NPC's from the Cleft of Shadow due to Siege, or did you not notice the corpses on your way down to kill Nazgrim.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the Hordes had a few losses. Not gonna be a bit surprised if they decide to kill off Durotan and let Thrall step in as chieftan, which will suck, I like Durotan.</div></div><hr />

The pinnacle of all Alliance heroes: becoming a garrison follower to do menial tasks for all eternity. Sounds like Taylor is actually in hell, so no...I don't think we should be getting credit for that. :p</div></div><hr />

The key is the frame where she says, &quot;Oh&quot;. There's no compassion or remorse, no nothing.</div></div><hr />
