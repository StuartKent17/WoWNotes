Also, vodka (http://www.vodka-guild.net/) (US-Alterac Mountains) released their video of Halion on PTRs and I assume that a few people would like to see the fight from another point of view. <br />

Totem of Wrath in Cataclysm<br />
They are both 10% of the target's spellpower (not the shaman or warlock's). We want Demonology and Elemental (and everyone) to be brought because they have good raid synergy and meaningful dps and because the person behind the keyboard is a good contributor. Nobody should get brought because they have the mandatory buff that you can't live without. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25026432523/problem-with-cata-totem-of-wrath-change/))<br />

Addon Spotlight - QuestMyMap<br />
I had to level a few more alts lately and I was more than happy to find QuestMyMap (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info16518-QuestMyMap.html). Also, Addon Spotlights are great because I can just copy/paste the description from the addon author! <br />
<br />
Download<br />
QuestMyMap on WoWInterface (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info16518-QuestMyMap.html)<br />
<br />
QuestMyMap is a small addon without configuration that aims to provide a nicer quest map and some fixes.<br />
<br />
Features:<br />
Resizes the quest map to full scale<br />
Drag border of the quest list to resize it (or shift-click / rightclick to toggle)<br />
Quest levels on quest titles<br />
Hides quest log and quest rewards on world map<br />
Moves quest selection frame to a transparent overlay<br />
Paste quest links from the world map with Shift-Click<br />
Rightclicking a selected quest opens the quest log<br />

<br />
The ten man loot is close to useless, because the majority of items can be attained through Emblems of Frost, and at which rate the EoF items are better than the drops on Halion.<br />
<br />
Drape of the Violet Tower (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50468/drape-of-the-violet-tower/) effectively is better than Abduction's Cover (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/53115/abductions-cover/), the new cape from the ten man instance. However, if you prefer haste, Abduction might be a very small upgrade, but not enough to get excited about.<br />
Belt of Omission (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50996/belt-of-omission/) COMPLETELY outdoes Misbegotten belt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/53118/misbegotten-belt/) - Upgrade in every possible stat except for one crit point, and attainable from Frost Emblems too.<br />
Gloves of the Great Horned Owl (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50981/gloves-of-the-great-horned-owl/) more or less outdo Changeling Gloves (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/53117/changeling-gloves/), despite the gloves having one more socket slot.<br />
Shadow Seeker's Tunic (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50972/shadow-seekers-tunic/) outdoes Gloaming Sark (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/53114/gloaming-sark/) by far.<br />
<br />
What can we conclude by this?<br />
<br />
Out of six loot items, two are not replaced by emblems, all other items can effectively be replaced just by gathering frost emblems.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but the only two loot items that do matter, are both for Melee DPS, meaning that there is no incentive for healers, ranged DPS, and agility classes(tank offspecs can use these as last resort) to even head down to the Ruby Sanctum on 10m mode.</div></div><hr />

Orly?<br />
Higher level items tend to be better amirite?<br />
Remember onyxias raid (80lvl). Back then you got 232lvl items when there were 245lvl item vendors available...<br />
It's same with this raid. Stop cryin srsly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference was that in that raid, there were sufficient items to make up for this. IE, weapons, trinkets, all sorts of things that could be used alongside the emblems, with exception of the helmets(which were surprisingly good compared to the vendor pieces).<br />
<br />
In this raid, we only have weaker duplicates of the emblem of frost rewards, part from two Melee DPS items.</div></div><hr />

Where is the love for mutilate rogues! /sigh looks like I should starting getting those 277 combat offsets...<br />
<br />
W-what? Here's a list of static ap trinkets that your muti rogue must love:<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/items=4.-4?filter=cr=77:131;crs=1:1;crv=1:0;gb=0#0-2+1<br />
<br />
Only counting raiding trinkets here, so excluding pvp ones, there is:<br />
<br />
1 ilvl 258<br />
1 ilvl 245<br />
1 ilvl 239<br />
1 ilvl 226<br />
1 ilvl 213<br />
<br />
Sure sucks that there's none from ICC, but still plenty of choices, of which toc25hc one is very decent. Now, let's look how many trinkets are out there for healers with static haste, since that's the only stat a resto shaman would like:<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/items=4.-4?filter=cr=103:131;crs=1:1;crv=1:0;gb=0#0-2+1<br />
<br />
Again, only picking healer trinkets, and excluding the pvp ones:<br />
<br />
1 ilvl 200<br />
<br />
WHOA HOLY SHIT!!! ONLY ONE TRINKET FOR RESTO SHAMANS AND IT'S FROM HEROIC HOS!!! Just as a slap in the face, it's not even epic, but rare (blue color). And guess what? It's still BIS trinket for us shammies, just because blizzard is catering *EVERYTHING* for druids. I stopped counting at 10, but there are probably at least 15 epic ilvl&gt;200 healing trinkets with static SP, just the way druids love them. With 3.3.5, there will be one more.</div></div><hr />

Well, let's see it like this. It's way easier to die in 25 man. For example, spreading out is way harder in 25 man, while it's easy peez in 10 man. And also, in 10 man there are 10 people that are able to fuck up, in 25 man there are 25. That means 15 more retards. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You really need to compare items with direct stats. Not doing so is just a waste of time.<br />
<br />
So Abduction's Cover (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/53115/abductions-cover/) should be compared to Heartsick Mender's Cape (http://www.wowhead.com/item=51382) for non-spirit based classes. However for spirit based classes it should really be compared to Greatcloak of the Turned Champion (http://www.wowhead.com/item=50014).<br />
<br />
http://ptr.wowhead.com/compare?items=53115;51382;50014 (comparison of all three). All three are presumed the same difficulty to obtain. Actually, the spirit one might be easier than the other to obtain.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Belt of Omission (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50996/belt-of-omission/) COMPLETELY outdoes Misbegotten belt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/53118/misbegotten-belt/) - Upgrade in every possible stat except for one crit point, and attainable from Frost Emblems too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Incorrect. What you are not noticing is the sockets. Lets assume you are hit capped, so the 14 hit rating becomes pointless (like in 95% of all cases). That puts Belt of Omission 3 spell power and 1 critical strike rating behind Misbegotten Belt. That means (if you are over the hit cap or at the hit cap with Misbegotten Belt) it not only isn't completely outdone its better. This might of course vary based on the class, but even if spirit is highly valued the two items become much more equal not the mismatch you make them out to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gloves of the Great Horned Owl (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50981/gloves-of-the-great-horned-owl/) more or less outdo Changeling Gloves (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/53117/changeling-gloves/), despite the gloves having one more socket slot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets socket the two items. Lets assume you are at the 401 soft haste cap for boomkin (and assume you are using these as a boomkin not another class since they are leather caster dps gear). Assuming conventional boomkin gemming, the Gloves the Great Horned Owl have 2 more crit but 7 less spellpower. That is definitely a decent trade off. However, it could be argued that the real comparison should be to Gloves of Ambivalence (http://ptr.wowhead.com/item=50984) (which are used by many boomkins) which would have 6 more crit and 9 more spell power (at the expense of haste, so it depends on valuable haste is on your given scale). Still the items are much closer than you make them out to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow Seeker's Tunic (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50972/shadow-seekers-tunic/) outdoes Gloaming Sark (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/53114/gloaming-sark/) by far.<br />
<br />
<br />
You easily have this one. No argument.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What can we conclude by this?<br />
<br />
Out of six loot items, two are not replaced by emblems, all other items can effectively be replaced just by gathering frost emblems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just using your comparisons, under given circumstances you were wrong on 3 of them given certain situations. What we can conclude from this is that these were really awesomely itemized 258s. Lets remember you are comparing 258s to 264s after all. Also, lets assume that the person is just starting out and not someone that has been raiding for 6 months with more than enough frosts to throw away. You get lucky the first time you do the dungeon and you have an item that you won't need to replace, so you can use Emblems elsewhere.<br />
<br />
The real conclusion... Gearing is now and always will be situational in WoW. Do you need more haste? Do you need more spellpower? Can you sacrifice some hit (because you are capped)? Can you sacrifice some crit for spell power? Did you just start raiding? Do you have 1000 frost emblems just waiting to be burnt?<br />
<br />
All of that comes into consideration in WoW, so to look at an item and say it is nothing more than DE trash for everyone in every given situation is NEVER a good idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not only that, but the only two loot items that do matter, are both for Melee DPS, meaning that there is no incentive for healers, ranged DPS, and agility classes(tank offspecs can use these as last resort) to even head down to the Ruby Sanctum on 10m mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is ZERO incentive for most people at this point to do ICC10. However, most are still doing it. There is ZERO incentive for most people to bother with VOA lottery at this point. Yet its still done. If gear is your only incentive for raiding then maybe you shouldn't raid. I actually like seeing things die while I keep people alive, so I go to stuff that I have no incentive to go to. Also, not that it really matters to me at this point (and this is only really after raiding for 1-2 months because I took some time off) I can always get emblems, and even if I have nothing to spend emblems on I can spend emblems on Primordial Saronite and turn them into gold that way (or donate to the guild or buy my BS patterns).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, because Restoration Shamans completely ignore spell power because its crap for them...OH WAIT! I would think that the top in slot for most healers (assuming they have absolutely no mana issues which a restoration shaman can normally get away with at this point) would be http://www.wowhead.com/item=50359 and http://www.wowhead.com/item=50366 since lets face it, to do heroic 25 gunship all you really have to do is kill LK in 25 man which will be a feat that MOST guilds will end up pulling off when the 30% buff is out if not before that. Barring that, you would probably throw in http://www.wowhead.com/item=50358 because on long fights you will probably not hurt from getting the mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WHOA HOLY SHIT!!! ONLY ONE TRINKET FOR RESTO SHAMANS AND IT'S FROM HEROIC HOS!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
You must be kidding. Seriously! Yes, haste is important, but to say that spell power is so pointless for a shaman that it makes a ilvl 200 better than a ilvl 277 is just a pointless argument you will NEVER win. The only reason you would try is to make the claim that you don't need the spell power because it will only result in overhealing which of course assumes that the fight is going perfectly and all the other healers are healing faster than you. Not to mention, chain heal has a 2.5 second cast time and can only be lowered by 1.5 seconds which means its not impossible to haste cap. On top of that, RAWR (elitistjerks.com) values SP above haste. If RAWR is messed up then a GREAT deal of players in this game are geared completely incorrectly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2010-05-25, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, let's see it like this. It's way easier to die in 25 man. For example, spreading out is way harder in 25 man, while it's easy peez in 10 man. And also, in 10 man there are 10 people that are able to fuck up, in 25 man there are 25. That means 15 more retards. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
In 10 man, if 2 people get themselves killed you have a wipe. In 25 man, if 2 people get themselves killed you kill the boss slower. Given that two people almost always manage to get themselves killed for stupid reasons in a pug (depending on how good your healers are at saving them) its quite obvious to see which one is more puggable (possibly easier).</div></div><hr />

For all I know Blizzard could already developing the same type of system for the New MMO (or even in some manner to WOW). Anyways I'm really intrigued about the whole idea so I just have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
In any case it will be a enormous change to whole concept of MMOs IF they (or someone else) can pull it off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You are right on some points, except that you are forgetting that I was making comparisons to Emblem of Frost items, to show that a large amount of gear gained in Ruby Sanctum as things are now, is hardly worth chasing after.<br />
<br />
With regards to the belt of omission, by socketing two times spellpower, one will give seven spellpower socket bonus, the other will give no bonus. Keep in mind however, that you can shift purple gems around to this belt for example, as you will need two blue gems for your meta anyhow. Not only that, but there is a higher amount of intellect present on the Belt of Omission, which means more mana, and for some it means more spellpower.<br />
<br />
The incentive for people to do ICC10 is progress at the moment, as well as insight to heroic mode gear. This gear can effectively replace old items by each number exact, which is why people'd keep going. The incentive for Ruby Sanctum10, would have to come from heroic gear.<br />
<br />
Finally, I have to agree that yes, this'd be a good instance for starting raiders to head to. But as the finishing instance of an expansion, this does not seem the smartest thing to do. There will be enough of guilds(depending on difficulty) that will be unable to transition from normal to heroic mode. Should these be left out, and instead let newer raiders be catered before the aforementioned guilds?<br />

if you ever did halion on 10 and 25 mode on ptr testing you would know the 10 man version is overall more difficult then 25 man version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
naw man they should go to fucking 80 man raids and to get attuned to the new molten core you have to chop off one of your fingers.<br />
<br />
EDIT: and I thought 10 man was generally thought of as slightly more difficult because there's less room for error/bad dps/bad heals. People say &quot;MORE PEOPLE TO MAKE MISTAKES&quot; but you have to realize that's 1/25th of your raid making a mistake, where in ten man it's 1/10th of your raid making the mistake. Which generally will result in a huge DPS loss, if someone gets croaked.<br />
<br />
It's kind of funny to see them saying in Cataclysm they are nerfing ARP and evening up 25man and 10man loot and then they make an encounter with another ARP trinket, and with 10man loot so bad I don't think anyone will run it.</div></div><hr />
