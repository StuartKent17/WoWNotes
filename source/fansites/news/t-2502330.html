<br />
Arms<br />
<br />
Damage of all abilities increased by 5%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: Arms Warrior, Destruction Warlock, Frost Death Knight and Unholy Death Knight are generally underperforming and could use a damage increase.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/rogue) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Q))<br />
<br />
Outlaw<br />
<br />
Blade Flurry now strikes nearby enemies for 30% of normal damage (was 45%).<br />
Keep Your Wits About You (Azerite Trait) now increases the chance for Sinister Strike to strike again by 3% (was 5%), and the maximum number of stacks has been increased to 33.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: While multi-target cleave is an iconic strength for Outlaw Rogue, we feel that Blade Flurry is currently too strong, particularly in Mythic Keystone dungeons. Likewise, the Azerite Trait Keep Your Wits About You provides too much added value to their AOE rotation at only a single instance of the trait. These changes should keep Outlaw Rogues very strong at multi-target cleave, but no longer significantly ahead of other specs.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/shaman) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#c))<br />
<br />
Restoration<br />
<br />
Healing Surge and Healing Wave healing increased by 10%, and mana cost reduced by 5%.<br />
Healing Rain healing increased by 20%<br />
Riptide heal-over-time increased by 15%.<br />
Wellspring healing increased by 15%.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: In general, Restoration Shamans are struggling with single target healing environments like Mythic Keystone Dungeons and Arenas, so we’re buffing some spells from their single target kit. At the same time, we also feel like they aren’t doing as well in a particular area where they should excel: healing a large number of targets in a small area, so we’re increasing the strength of Healing Rain. Finally, Wellspring is an underperforming talent we feel could benefit from an increase to be competitive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
All Tier 3 Azerite Traits (such as Resounding Protection and Impassive Visage) are now reduced to 20% effectiveness in PvP (was 50%).<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: We’d like to see sustained damage become a greater source of pressure in Arena and Battlegrounds, but the passive healing providing by these Azerite Traits offsets much of that damage. We think that by decreasing their impact, we’ll see greater pressure on health and mana pools going forward.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br />
<br />
Necrotic Strike’s Necrotic Wound now absorbs 5% of the target’s maximum health in healing received (was 7%).<br />
The melee attack damage and attack speed of the Raise Abomination guardian has been decreased by 30%.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: While Death Knight damage is underperforming in raid environments, they are very strong in PvP. To offset the increases to their base damage, we’re reducing the effectiveness of two very strong Honor Talents.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Temporal Shield now has a 4 second duration (was 6 seconds).<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: While we like the predictive gameplay of Temporal Shield in response to offensive pressure, we think the duration provides too much protection for a class that should be focused on control and mobility for defense.</div></div><hr />

I hope so? But it seems unlikely. My AFF sims almost 40k with pretty decent traits, Destro with better traits is simming at 34k. I don't think the 5% will do much in the way of balance. It will take more than a 5% flat buff. Just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glimmer is here to stay. But resto is getting buffed. Sure we'll see something else soon &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Philosophically, when we add customizable systems and bonuses to the game, some player-discovered experience is exactly the sort of thing we're hoping will happen. Even when we didn't anticipate all the details of an optimized build—arguably especially when we didn't anticipate all the details—it produces a chance for players to explore something cool and rewarding. Almost by definition, those situations are at least slightly imbalanced or slightly broken, which is acceptable as long as they're not too imbalanced or too broken.<br />
There's a balance where cutting off the exploration too early ruins the fun of discovering it, but letting it go on too long gets to a point where players are less excited by the novelty of the new build and more bothered by imbalances or rotational problems. We want to keep an eye on that, but the preliminary look for 8.2 is that this is still a lively setup that people are excited to play. Any change would likely be a small tweak that's not intended to change its status as a popular or recommended playstyle.</div></div><hr />

Typical Blizzard move. Instead of nerfing the op warlock specs just buff the balanced ones. Warlock tuning since 2005.<br />
<br />

Enhances already does good damage, they don't need 5% damage buffs. <br />
<br />
Enhances actual problems are only going to be fixed with a spec rework and that isn't going to happen in some minor tuning pass if you were holding out for it.</div></div><hr />

No it wont? I don't know what you're basing that off but Enhance is performing fine DPS wise, strong even. Go take a look over on Warcraft logs if you don't believe me.<br />

I know it would. The spec is just plain bad. They'd have to go limit themselves with encounter design just to make Arcane even viable in raiding. Or buff it by 30-35% making it utterly broken on ST.<br />
<br />
Neither of which are not going to happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's literally what I was just talking to a friend about. Before they knew what was overpowered or under powered and they tuned certain spells. They've done numerous just flat increases or decreases of damage this expansion. It really boggles my mind that a class' overall power is just 5% off and not certain spells over performing or under performing. If it was simply just changing overall damage by X% to make classes balanced, then we'd see everyone competing pretty close with each other. Obviously that is not the case and just changing a couple percents doesn't actually solve anything.</div></div><hr />

But this is exactly the design they are going for years now. Design classes in a way that they actually can just turn a knob 5% up.</div></div><hr />

What about tanks? Prot warriors running around spiking to 150k dps on trash in M+ while barely needing to be healed. Either nerf them or buff other tanks. At this point they are 10 tiers above anything else its no wonder almost every tank in the MDI is a prot warrior and at the top they represent over 50% of the keys done. How does balance become this bad? Ya they already got a nerf. It was barely a slap on the wrist. After a single season Blood DK's got hit with multiple hard hitting nerfs. After 2 seasons now we see prot warriors being left as is. In current gear they are already back to the damage they did last season and then some. <br />
<br />
How about them arcane and frost mages? Mistweaver monks? Azerite traits that are still trash? Tank tuning? PvP tuning? I don't want to be rude but what are these &quot;developers&quot; doing this expansion? All of last season there was countless cries by the community to look at under performing specs and these &quot;developers&quot; just have the blinders on. We knew every team from last season would be prot warrior, resto druid, triple rogue. It literally had to happen for Blizzard to nerf outlaw rogues and they are still not done because healers and tanks need a tuning pass now, not 9.0.<br />

And then we just have these half ass lazy flat % buffs that amount to nothing like what happened with arcane mages. Buffed 6% and still at the bottom of the charts and useless in M+. I feel like my money is being stolen at this point. There is no passion anymore in this game by the developers. I like 8.2 in terms of the content that it released with but I'm already bored of it. Class design and balance is an absolute disgrace this expansion. I would pick WoD over this pile of garbage.<br />
<br />
I literally have no interest in playing &quot;alts&quot; this expansion. In prior expansions I had multiple characters that managed to get roughly around the same level of gear. I actually don't think World of Warcraft has a dedicated team of developers anymore and any changes we get are done by interns who don't even play the game either. It's like they have a dartboard of the worst performing specs in the game and another dartboard with what % they will be buffed by. *Throws dart* looks like we landed on Arcane Mage. *Throws dart again* looks like they are getting a 6% buff. Let's test this. Oh wait we fired the entire QA team. Oh well lets hope its enough. Nope still trash at the bottom of the charts.</div></div><hr />

What about tanks? Prot warriors running around spiking to 150k dps on trash in M+ while barely needing to be healed. Either nerf them or buff other tanks. At this point they are 10 tiers above anything else its no wonder almost every tank in the MDI is a prot warrior and at the top they represent over 50% of the keys done. How does balance become this bad? Ya they already got a nerf. It was barely a slap on the wrist. After a single season Blood DK's got hit with multiple hard hitting nerfs. After 2 seasons now we see prot warriors being left as is. In current gear they are already back to the damage they did last season and then some.<br />
<br />
Agree. For someone like me that mains a Blood DK with Guardian as alt it's frustrating that Prot War is so far ahead. Insane damage, great mobility and on top of that, really good cooldowns. Does everyone at blizzard play Prot Warrior maybe? Thats why they never nerf it?<br />
Honestly i would rather see a buff to all the other tanks though. Especially on the damage output.</div></div><hr />

Day 1. Not month. The very first moment I stepped into a mythic dungeon with my resto shaman I knew this would not be a healer to play in dungeons this expansion. So much worse than any other spec.

Enhance Shamans fighting in a phone booth are great. Add in aoe and movement and they fall to the bottom fast. Enhancement is great for world quests where the mobs don't move and u can int their abilities.<br />

Enhancement also terrible in M+ unless as stated above they on boss fights with limited movement.<br />

I have a 410 outlaw rogue with 1 green crucible essence and crap gear and I'm top in M10 by afking watching netflix and pressing BF on mob packs, it's redic.<br />
This change should be added in now though, not later.<br />
<br />
So what you're saying is you don't play rogue and just have and hold a grudge against the class for some unknown reason. That wasn't a critique by someone who even remotely plays the class let alone is unbiased it was a weird, angry rant. Outlaw bf cleave is by FAR their best and most desirable tool, their single target is middle of the pack at BEST. This isn't opinion logs can prove this, Assassination is better at single target by a longshot. Stop being silly and going on some ridiculous diatribe because you're butthurt. 30 percent isn't enough? Jesus just uninstall please.</div></div><hr />

People are unhappy with the lack of utility and rotation/priority. This wont be fixed until at least 9.0. The spec does not need dmg increases at all, it needs a complete rewamp because its BORING.<br />

Prot Warriors were bad early BfA, got overbuffed, and here we are. It'll get brought in line at some point, but maybe not before 9.0.<br />

Half these comments prove what many of us say constantly. You could hand out gold bars to the wow community and people would be complaining about that they are heavy.<br />

its the only thing this specc has, UH doesnt have insane burst like most other classes, it doesnt have 10 different kinds of hard CC, hell its easily the slowest class in game. the only catch up it has is death grip which also can be avoided by LoS by most healers who can move slightly faster than a turtle with broken spine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the way to do it man. Rogue is also a smart pick since one spec always does well and you have 3 DPS-centric specs. I do the same as you, and stick to my main just because I enjoy it and I'm good at it. There's a ton of hours in research and perfecting how I play it. It's unfortunately a Ret Paladin, so I don't get the versatility of spec swapping if it's not in a good place. However, a player who knows the intricacies of his class and can play it effectively will always be better than some new guy swapping to the FotM class every time a new tuning pass comes out.<br />
<br />
As far as the buffs go, I'm extremely happy to see Resto buffs. They are a GREAT class to have in raid to make DPS checks since they can do some solid damage while healing the raid. I'm glad their healing is getting some love too now.<br />
<br />
DK and Arms have been underperforming, DK a lot less than Arms, so it's nice to see the love there. The issue is that Arms will still be bottom even with 5%. The guys in here spouting some bullshit about their spec becoming the bottom melee after this, don't worry Arms will still be it (or they may surpass sub Rogues, but all that will do is make the 2nd last be last, and the dead last become 2nd last.)<br />
<br />
I am a bit on the fence about the Destro buff (they were in a comfortable middle I thought), but we have a Destro lock in our raid, and Mythic Ashvane's DPS check is a bitch, so that's cool I guess.</div></div><hr />

That's why i quit playing BFA, they aren't going to make meaningful mechanical changes midway into an expac. The least they could do though is tune talents correctly, that way I can at least have multiple builds instead of one all the time.</div></div><hr />

Typical Blizzard move. Instead of nerfing the op warlock specs just buff the balanced ones. Warlock tuning since 2005.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what op warlock specs you are referring to, both aff and demo are marginal at best and at the middle of the pack, destro however is massively underpowered and performing almost completely bottom tier, a buff was absolutely necessary, 5% might not even be enough of a buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So there are 32k affliction logs, 1,8k destruction logs and 2,4k demo logs in mythic palace. Affliction alone is the 3rd most played spec right now. Only balance druids (34k) and havoc demonhunters (35k) see more action in mythic eternal palace. And havoc is only this high up bacause blizzard made them mandatory for every raidgroup.<br />
Depending on the Boss, shadow priests are the highest dps spec in eternal palace but there are only 23k shadow logs.<br />
<br />
So clearly warlocks have no viability problem. Their damage is fine and their utility is insane. Shadows and elementals for example are only viable because of their high dps. They have almost zero utility. <br />
And this is pretty much the worst place warlocks have been in since cata. They are not super op right now but still one of the best classes to have.</div></div><hr />

Average guilds are struggling in the raid due to damage taken being too high, they can't nerf glimmer without retuning the raid.<br />

They buffed shamans by a lot and need data before the next round of buffing other healing specs to match glimmer numbers.<br />

After these buffs, it will be dead last DPS spec in the game, along with having a terrible gameplay loop AND a huge reliance on RNG. Seems good.<br />

So at 25% proc chance you can go 10+ casts of your shit filler spell and your DPS goes down the drain. <br />
<br />
Then they design raids that focus much of the mechanics whether intentional or not on the ranged classes, look at Radiance strat is to circle boss. Further they add two boss encounter(s) but force them to be apart or your damage is -90% effectively killing any ranged caster cleave spec.<br />

Frost mages they have let No-IL spec stand when it should have been gutted moment it was feasible.<br />
