Patch 5.4 - Ashhide Mushan and Bloody Coins<br />
Patch 5.4 adds Speaker Gulan (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/73307-speaker-gulan), who will sell you a Censer of Eternal Agony (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/102467-censer-of-eternal-agony), which allows you to become hostile to all players (including your own faction) and kill them for Bloody Coins (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/789-bloody-coin), which are used to purchase a PvP trinket (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103639-pouch-of-white-ash), pet (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103637-vengeful-porcupette), mount (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/103638-reins-of-the-ashhide-mushan-beast), as well as a few other items.<br />

Website Cleanup Incoming<br />
Like any good webmasters, we look at World of Warcraft site stats on a regular basis, and we're always evaluating which aspects of the site people find most useful. Over time, we've identified a few areas that players don't really seem to visit but that still require a bit of effort for us to keep updated each time we release a new content update. For most of these, it's pretty obvious why they don't draw a lot of attention-they tend to focus on things that are simply more compelling to look at inside the game, are a &quot;given,&quot; or are already well-served and readily available elsewhere, like on fansites.<br />
<br />
Early next week we'll be doing some cleanup and removing the following rarely visited, higher-maintenance sections from the World of Warcraft website:<br />
<br />
Game Guide<br />
<br />
Pets &amp; Mounts Gallery (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/pet-mount/pet)<br />
Factions (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/faction/#expansion=4)<br />
Professions (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/profession/)<br />
<br />
Guild Profiles<br />
Perks and Rewards sections (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/guild/sargeras/Midwinter/perk)<br />
<br />
Character Profiles<br />
Pets &amp; Mounts (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/scarlet-crusade/Breanni/pet#status=is-collected)<br />
Hunter Pets (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/tichondrius/Tosan/hunter-pet#38346)<br />
Professions (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/bronzebeard/Nyctelia/profession/inscription)<br />
Reputation (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/whisperwind/Moshne/reputation/)<br />
<br />
Here are just a few fansites that provide a wealth of information on the above topics, as well as a whole lot more! <br />
<br />
Wowhead<br />
Warcraft Pets<br />
Warcraft Mounts<br />
WoW-Petopia<br />
<br />
Doesn't WarcraftPets USE the pets section of the armory to update people's collections? You are going to break their site with this decision. Please don't remove the Pet &amp; Mounts section. <br />
To clarify, this cleanup process shouldn't affect the API fansites and other people use to pull game data.<br />
<br />

Flexible Mode Testing - August 9-12<br />
We've unlocked the Underhold wing of the Siege of Orgrimmar (Malkorok, Spoils of Pandaria, and Thok the Bloodthirsty) for testing over the weekend, continuing into Monday. <br />
<br />
Players with a premade group of between 10 and 25 players can queue using the same interface that you'd use for Dungeons, Scenarios, or LFR. Flexible mode bosses have all the same mechanics as the Normal mode versions, but are otherwise tuned to be more forgiving, and will scale in health and damage output with the number of players in the raid. As you go from a 12-player raid to an 18-player raid, for example, some abilities may affect more targets or hit slightly harder, creatures will have more health, and so forth. Difficulty is almost certainly higher than our final target, but we're probably scaling players down a bit too far for testing right now (ilvl 522 for the Underhold wing).<br />
<br />
Please provide specific comments and feedback in the dedicated feedback thread.<br />
<br />

Combat PvE and Patch 5.4<br />
So, like I mentioned earlier in the thread, we upped the energy cost and damage of Sinister Strike to try to cut back on the spam just slightly. Incidentally, it also helps with the issue of energy capping while both Adrenaline Rush and Shadow Blades are active with the Tier 15 4-piece bonus.<br />
<br />
We feel that, with the higher Sinister Strike energy cost in place, we can leave the Tier 15 4-piece as it is. It'll still be a good set bonus, but not quite as good as before, to the point that we don't think it'll have an adverse effect on Tier 16 balance.<br />
<br />
Now, I recognize that the general sentiment in this thread seems to disagree with that. Part of why I'm posting this is that I'd like to understand why that is. Keep in mind that this isn't part of balance tuning -- that'll be starting soon, but for the moment we're just trying to get Combat to &quot;feel&quot; right. We're confident that we can make the numbers line up properly with how things are currently functioning on the PTR, but if you disagree, we'd like to know why. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/264190-combat-pve-and-54/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9423803534?page=31#609))<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4 PTR - Proving Grounds Bug<br />
We’ve discovered a fairly significant bug that explains why we’ve been seeing such drastically different reports on Proving Grounds difficulty. Simply put, PvP gear is not getting its item level downscaled to 463 the way that PvE gear is; it’s staying at item level 522.<br />
<br />
We hope to have this fixed ASAP. In the meantime, if you’re testing out Proving Grounds on the PTR, please try to avoid using PvP gear if at all possible.<br />

The Burdens of Shaohao<br />
Blizzard released (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265688-the-burdens-of-shaohaopart-3-fear/) a six part series that looks at Emperor Shaohao as he progresses toward discovering the truth about his future. Today was the release of the final part. If you want to see more like this in the future, be sure to let Blizzard know you enjoyed it!<br />

Exactly what I see when I read the blue post on that, it is nothing less than pure laziness to let fan sites handle even simple armory features rather than possibly making the armory better so more people actually make use of it and it's features. Taking away half of whats there they may as well just kill the armory as a whole, hell fansites can probably do a better job at that too why put any effort into the official website dedicated to the game and let people who want to look on the site for news or guides just walk blindly into the game when not everyone may want to use a fansite or addon for a feature that works perfectly fine on the armory.<br />
<br />
For a game as big as WoW is you would think maybe just maybe they would want a high end official site dedicated to it for news/guides/and features. But instead they seem to have thrown in the towel and figure if they can't please everyone on the website they would rather let it burn letting others handle the pieces, can't even rely on it for news anymore outside of patch notes when the vast majority of info is posted on twitter now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, although one of his ancestors can be seen in one Jade Forest quest wearing a Caverns of Time tabard, so his family might be somehow related to the Bronze Flight.<br />
<br />
Since Pandaria's races thought Pandaria was the only remaining part of the world after the Sundering, I doubt they knew any Bronze Dragons for the last 10,000 years, but his early ancestors might have met one and had the need for historical documentation impressed on them, leading to the creation of the Lorewalkers.</div></div><hr />

He's most likely an agent of the flight, like the taunka in Storm Peaks.</div></div><hr />

If you are on a PvE realm, I can almost guarantee blue flagging yourself will make you safe. If you are bitching about this on a PvP realm, get off the PvP realm. Your poor choice of home is not Blizzard's problem. Either way, shh.</div></div><hr />

Exactly what I see when I read the blue post on that, it is nothing less than pure laziness to let fan sites handle even simple armory features rather than possibly making the armory better so more people actually make use of it and it's features. Taking away half of whats there they may as well just kill the armory as a whole, hell fansites can probably do a better job at that too why put any effort into the official website dedicated to the game and let people who want to look on the site for news or guides just walk blindly into the game when not everyone may want to use a fansite or addon for a feature that works perfectly fine on the armory.<br />
<br />
For a game as big as WoW is you would think maybe just maybe they would want a high end official site dedicated to it for news/guides/and features. But instead they seem to have thrown in the towel and figure if they can't please everyone on the website they would rather let it burn letting others handle the pieces, can't even rely on it for news anymore outside of patch notes when the vast majority of info is posted on twitter now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Would you prefer that they devote money and resources to inconsequential crap like this, that can be found in game or elsewhere, or......spend that money and resources on the game itself.<br />
<br />

The point is they were fucking lazy and now just want to get rid of it so people stop asking them why the mount and recipe lists have items that were never implemented instead of spending a few hours to do it themselves. It cannot be some huge undertaking to maintain a couple of pages but hey whatever man keep drinking that kool aid.</div></div><hr />

Here's how it works right now.<br />
<br />
It's a 10 second cast.<br />
<br />
It CREATES ITS OWN NEW FACTION: other people also using the cesure will now be friendly to you even from the opposite faction. People who are NOT of EITHER faction will now be hostile on PvP servers or on PvE servers if flagged.<br />
<br />
It drains 90% of your hp upon completion of the cast but can and is healed back to full; just make sure you don't activate it in the middle of a crowd.</div></div><hr />

Or I just don't think an addon or fansite should have to do the work for them when they barely did any work to begin with on the armory pages. As big as this game is it should be expected that it has a better official source for news/guides/features when it pays it's staff well, rather than smaller fansites doing everything for them that get payed pennies compared to what blizz gives it's staff.</div></div><hr />

I think the word you're looking for is &quot;tune&quot;, since it's not released yet. They almost always start with things harder on the PTR, since it's easier (and they get less complaints) to make things easier on release than to make them more challenging on release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And instead you'll just see a bunch of people complaining about how they got griefed while trying to do X activity (ie: killing Ordos or killing an elite). It'll be the zombie event 2.0.<br />
<br />
I kind of side with those who feel that they shouldn't be able to be same faction ganked even if they rolled on a PVP realm. There was a lot of outcry after the zombie event, and Blizzard removed it early, so I'm going to try to get this done quickly before they might potentially nerf it.<br />

Not quite, as the zombie event could force people to fight even if they weren't flagged. It won't negatively impact PvE servers at all. Now PvP servers will become more of a mess, but hey, if you rolled on a PvP server and didn't wanna PvP, this is what you get, IMO.</div></div><hr />

I think you can make the case some of those players rolled PVP to fight the opposite faction, not their own. Same faction is sort of a gray area. This is a playstyle that we're not accustomed to. I have no doubt it'll go live like this though since it's just the Timeless Isle. Well...except for the fact that the 50 coin Fire Watcher's Oath works anywhere. That seems unintended. One of the PVE trinkets I tested (Alpha and Omega) was giving me stacks from goblin glider and counterspell so oversights do happen on the PTR.<br />

I agree, but I think what they are really testing is being able to change a players faction ´on the fly´. This has, in the past, broken a lot of things ( faction changes), like mounts, and some quest stuff. Same faction pvp has always been available with duels.</div></div><hr />
