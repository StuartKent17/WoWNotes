<br />
I see.. one nerf, piercing howl. Spell reflection glyph nerf became baseline - read as a buff.<br />
And lots of buffs, altough quite small.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I wonder how Spirit shell will work in the end. Obvious spot is prepulls and then before some intensive phases. Latter might become bit too much strainful on mana though, compared to others healing strictly during the intensive phase and disc priest healing before and during. I don't know. Don't think that'll last at it's current form, especially when thinking on how useless it's for non-raiding (even heroics or those Challengemodes.. don't think Spirit shell will see much use). I quite liked the original version, but obviously that wasn't going to work.</div></div><hr />

And melee are supposed to be able to melee. The scale suddenly became closer to &quot;balance&quot;, Blizzard sees this and makes sure it tips in casters favor. Why? Casters have spells to get away from melee. They shouldn't have an arsenal of spells to make sure melee stay away.</div></div><hr />

Are you serious right now? I actually cannot tell. If you are, then so what? Hunters get a unique ability that allows there pet to collect the loot for them.<br />
It's not game changing, it has no affect on any other classes.<br />
<br />
And when you think about it, your loot a rang may well be a 1.5 second cast.. but it will probably take the pet that long to actually get there and loot the damn thing.<br />

The fact that it says &quot;now makes you immune to movement impairing effects, instead of movement slowing effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of The act of shapeshifting frees the caster of movement impairing effects. Like Glyph of Treant says ,leads me to believe its worded correctly.<br />
<br />
Glyph of Treant is for healers so they can break root effects cause there not immune to movement impairing effects Until there shifted into treant form.<br />

<br />
I finally registered on this site after several years just to respond to this &quot;critique.&quot; <br />
<br />
Yes, that's right, hunters get a toy to play with that makes their class somewhat unique. Just like the old days when warlocks could only summon and druids could battle res (last point more debatable, however I would argue that it is inexcusable to not have 1 or 2 druids in your raid for 10 and 25 respectively). Mana burn should not have ever been changed because it invited a different element and a resultant different play-style. Allowing oneself to be mana burned is inexcusable and a result of poor play-style and/or communication. <br />
<br />
But rather than constructing a strawman and diverging from my original point: I'm highly surprised that people are more concerned about classes getting toys and/or becoming more unique and not worried about imbalances as far as raw numbers are concerned. For example, Cataclysm (and to a lesser extent, WotLK) featured stacking of rogues in raids not because of unique class abilities, but due to overwhelmingly disproportionate DPS. <br />
<br />
Class homogenization insofar as abilities are concerned = bad<br />
Class homogenization insofar as output numbers (HPS, DPS, I guess TPS) = good, desirable, and should be the design paradigm that Blizzard focuses upon</div></div><hr />

Can't believe you are whining about that while druids run around freely with movement impairing immunity. That is a major gameplay advantage and always has been for druids now they are just making it even easier but you complain because Hunters have a unique ability that gives them no advangage but to pick up junk slightly farther away with probably like 3 extra clicks *the time it would take to run there</div></div><hr />
