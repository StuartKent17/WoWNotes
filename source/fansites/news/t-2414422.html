War of Thorns Quest Chain<br />
Spoilers ahead! The War of Thorns (https://wow.gamepedia.com/War_of_the_Thorns) quest chain that leads up to the Burning of Teldrassil starts today!<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a time gate this week on the quest chain that ends at the halfway point.<br />
This quest chain involves the Horde marching on Teldrassil through Darkshore while what little Darnassian troops are available try to hold them back. It eventually culminates in the burning of the tree.<br />
Both factions unlock the world quests in Darkshore after completing the quest chain up to the halfway point where there is a stalemate at Wildbend River. These world quests provide catch up gear, order hall resources, and gold.<br />
Alliance players are rewarded with the Smoldering Reins of the Teldrassil Hippogryph (https://beta.wowdb.com/items/163127-smoldering-reins-of-the-teldrassil-hippogryph) while the Horde receives the War-Torn Reins of the Undercity Plaguebat (https://beta.wowdb.com/items/163128-war-torn-reins-of-the-undercity-plaguebat) for completing the entire quest chain.<br />

<br />
<br />
World Boss - Shar'thos<br />
The Sleeping Corruption (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/42779-the-sleeping-corruption) is up this week, so you can head to Val'sharah to kill Shar'thos (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/108678-sharthos). He drops a piece of the Fury Warrior hidden artifact appearance (https://www.wowdb.com/items/140659-skull-of-sharthos). <br />

<br />
<br />
Weekly Bonus Event - Legion Dungeons<br />
The Legion Dungeon Event is live this week!<br />
<br />
<br />
You will get one extra piece of loot from the final dungeon boss on difficulties below Mythic+.<br />
Pick up Emissary of War (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/44171-emissary-of-war) from Archmage Timear (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) in Dalaran to earn Cache of Antoran Treasures (https://www.wowdb.com/items/153501-cache-of-antoran-treasures)<br />
This quest requires you to clear 4 Mythic(+) dungeons and rewards Heroic Antorus loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
All week, open Group Finder (default hotkey: i) and then select Dungeon Finder to queue for any Legion dungeon on Normal or Heroic difficulty. Alternately, get a group of veteran dungeoneers together and travel to one of the Legion dungeons on Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
Look for the following all week long:<br />
<br />
<br />
Archmage Timear (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/44171-emissary-of-war) for you. Or, if you forget to pick it up there, you can start it from within the Adventure Journal. <br />
<br />
Quest requirement: Complete 4 Legion dungeons on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Rewards: One loot box containing a piece of gear from Heroic difficulty Antorus. <br />
<br />
Passive bonus: The final boss in each dungeon drop additional loot on all difficulties (except Mythic Keystone difficulties). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jump into PvP Brawls: Deep Six<br />
Who has your six in this six vs. six brawl? Deep Six will put you and your group to the test.<br />
<br />
Every other week, a new PvP Brawl will be available to players looking for something just a little different. Each Brawl will offer a variety of modes, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay, and you’ll find them in the Group Finder tool (hotkey “I”) in the Player vs. Player tab. Just like Random Battlegrounds, you’ll receive a reward for achieving victory.<br />
<br />
Deep Six pits teams of six players against each other in three iconic Battlegrounds: Warsong Gulch, Silvershard Mines, and Temple of Kotmogu. Each Battleground offers a little variation on the traditional format, such as flags that are a bit closer in Warsong Gulch, less carts to keep track of in Silvershard Mines, and only two orbs within the Temple of Kotmogu.</div></div><hr />

The first part of the Horde questline stops, when Sylvanas reaches a standstill and tells you, that they'll have to wait for Saurfang to come through from Felwood via Winterspring with his army. It makes sense that it takes a week or so to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the reason is to just build anticipation. Which works better, if you do it in smaller doses over time. <br />
<br />
Same reason there isn't only one trailer for a movie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
would you rather wait till the week before prepatch to just do all 3?<br />
or would you rather have alittle bit of something to do each week.<br />
the point of the world quests is you are trying to hold back the horde but then they win, if they just burnt it down then well the alliance has lost and left, no world quests to do...</div></div><hr />

I get that they'll shoehorn a little &quot;oh it's gonna take some time to do this&quot; thing, obviously they'll do that. It's just silly to timegate it.<br />

Given the choice between having the content available or artificially gated, yes, I will take having it available. If I choose to save parts of the quest for later, I can do that.</div></div><hr />

Better than just releasing it all in one go and people gobbling it up on day one. As long as the end result over those 3 weeks is meaty and decent I'm happy.</div></div><hr />

this is how they do pre expansion stuff. its nothing new really. its fine how it is we still have weeks before BFA launches. <br />

I understand this, it's just still kind of stupid. I'm sure it's to reflect nicely on player retention going into the new expansion, really. They want people logging on every week leading into launch.</div></div><hr />

Well, it's player retention. It's more about getting them to log on than to only stay subbed. I just hate it. Garrisons and Class Halls were for the sake of player retention and I hate both of them, too.</div></div><hr />

so you rather the quest get added all at one two weeks from now instead part now, part next week, then part the week after, gotcha.<br />
unlike you i rather get abit of content at a time instead of all of it at the very end.<br />

Uhm what date is it the day after next week? Seriously dude if you are going to claim the time gating isn't a little bit about keeping people subbed especially after the 14 week atrocity that was Broken Shore then go for it.<br />
<br />
This one is only 3 weeks and actually makes a bit of sense as it's a war effort and it's way closer to the expansion.<br />
<br />
Broken Shore was 14 weeks of mediocre single questlines that had no actual story to them until the last week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eleccy you dissapoint me.<br />
if wow sub was based on the start of the month you would have a point.<br />
but boy oh boy.<br />
if you subbed for the prepatch, you would get to do all the prepatch in a single sub, if it was all in one week, or split up over 3 weeks. come on man, this is just fucking sad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes if subs were ONLY ON the first day of a month yes i would understand &quot;they are trying to strech into a new month to force people to sub!&quot; or if it was more then 1 month long exactly &quot;yeah they are trying to get 2 subs out of people&quot; I would agree, the broken shore 14 weeks was fucking utter trash.<br />
but this is 3 weeks, all available within one month...<br />

<br />
Correct, but if you came back to the game buyying your sub during the start of the prerpatch, you would be able to get them all within that prepatch, either way.</div></div><hr />

We want all the content, not just a 20 minute bite, or at minimum complete a chain where it feels like we've accomplished literally anything.<br />

Again who is we? You do not speak for anyone here but yourself.<br />

As I said I don't mind it as long as it doesn't end up with 2/3 of it being barely story like Broken Shore. Or in Broken Shores case 13/14 of it.<br />

Argus was alright because it was all actually a very nice story over a short period of time.<br />

<br />
<br />
Eleccy you dissapoint me.<br />
if wow sub was based on the start of the month you would have a point.<br />
but boy oh boy.<br />
if you subbed for the prepatch, you would get to do all the prepatch in a single sub, if it was all in one week, or split up over 3 weeks. come on man, this is just fucking sad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes if subs were ONLY ON the first day of a month yes i would understand &quot;they are trying to strech into a new month to force people to sub!&quot; or if it was more then 1 month long exactly &quot;yeah they are trying to get 2 subs out of people&quot; I would agree, the broken shore 14 weeks was fucking utter trash.<br />
but this is 3 weeks, all available within one month...<br />
Come on eleccy you are better then this.<br />
<br />
Don't pull that attempt at demeaning with the &quot;you are better than this&quot; crap. It doesn't work on me.<br />
<br />
If you really want to sit there and say the intent of time gated content isn't to keep the MAU up. Then go for it. But considering that it hasn't been done on this scale before then it's safe to speculate that it is the reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would that blow your mind?<br />
<br />
Except, no, not everything is. It's an MMO with a sub so some level of timegating is to be expected but this is an artificial way of trying to retain players logging in and staying subbed, it's actually very frowned upon in the MMO development world because it's such a universally-considered poor way to do things. Of course, it's still something every MMO will fall back on using to some degree.<br />
<br />
But just because it's a ploy to keep players logging in doesn't mean it can not be criticized, or complained about. Our back and forth has reached its conclusion and I will not respond to you further than this.</div></div><hr />

So guess what buddy, its allmost like you can just wait till the end to do it all?<br />
<br />
they add it in one week at a time, instead of all at once in the final week, it is your choice to do it that way.<br />
if you want it all at once you can just sub the last week of Prepatch and get the full teld story, then the undercity, with no hold back.<br />
for us who want alittle bit of stuff to do ahead of time, want to feel like its an actual warfront that takes time, we got a short little half an hour a week earlier, and some world quests to gear our alts.</div></div><hr />

&quot;It hasnt been done on this scale before&quot; oh boy eleccy man i usually look up to you but today is just bad.<br />
Remember when ICC released a wing each week?<br />
remember when sunwell had time gating?<br />
remember when even silithus back in vanilla had weeks and weeks of time gating.<br />
Remember when wod had the garrison campaign that took weeks aswell, how to get for example the violet protodrake takes A WHOLE YEAR or more if you miss a chieve.<br />
<br />
The game has had much worse time gating then fucking 3 week quest line buddy...<br />

The Violet Proto Drake is a fucking holiday reward. It's intentional timegating because it's a reward for finishing the holidays which are intended for people who hunt mounts or want that specific drake. What the hell do you want them to do in that situation? Just have it require the Midsummer Fire Festival and be done with it?<br />
<br />
Sunwell don't know. Didn't play BC.<br />

Also you &quot;looking upto me&quot; is your own fault. I don't really care nor did I ask you to.<br />

You seriously just say the most insane things. It's clear you do not think what you're saying through all the way.<br />
<br />
First, they're not banking on anyone letting their subscription roll over for the questline. They want people to log on every week so it looks good to investors, because &quot;Look, we had so many players logging on in the weeks up to Battle for Azeroth! So much hype!&quot; looks good when you can say it at an investment meeting. It's not purely, or even primarily, about subscriptions.<br />

Yeah, no. You do not understand this at all. It's not all about people staying subbed, investors want to see people logging into the game. It looks bad if you have a large amount of players only logging in once or twice a month because you can't rely on those subscriptions to exist for much longer. The way this whole business model works is that you want to be able to safely predict that subs who are subbed right now will remain subbed in the future, you don't want to take it on a month-by-month basis saying &quot;um look how many subs we got this month lol&quot;.<br />
<br />
You fundamentally don't understand this so stop arguing, dude. Just stop.</div></div><hr />

Why the fuck should care about how many people log in a day, it does not effect them at all, what does is how much money it makes.<br />
<br />
The game could have 1 player who pays 10,000,000 a month to the game and they wouldent give a fuck.<br />
once the money drops that is when it matters.<br />

It's an MMO with a sub so some level of timegating is to be expected but this is an artificial way of trying to retain players logging in and staying subbed, it's actually very frowned upon in the MMO development world because it's such a universally-considered poor way to do things. Of course, it's still something every MMO will fall back on using to some degree.<br />

But just because it's a ploy to keep players logging in doesn't mean it can not be criticized, or complained about. Our back and forth has reached its conclusion and I will not respond to you further than this.<br />

<br />
So you rather had waited 14 weeks to get it all at once, instead of one per week. See me and many i know prefer 1 quest a week for 14 weeks instead of nothing for 13 weeks, then 14 quests on week 14, but i understand there is lots like you.<br />
<br />
Its allmost a question of would you rather have waited 2 years of wod nothing to then get legion to launch with it and all its patches at launch, then 2 years of nothing to then get BFA with all of its patches at launch.<br />
<br />
Do you see patches at time gating? Would you rather expansions launch with ALL their changes at the start, followed by 2 years of nothing till the next expansion.<br />
<br />
would you rather wotlk launched with nax, uld, ToC, ICC, ruby sanctum, and everything else, followed by 2 years of nothingness?<br />

It's not irrelevant. Time-gating has been a part of this game for quite some time now. The inability of the players to not recognize that a vast majority of content is time-gated upon release is not my fault. Thus, pointlessly complaining about it on a fansite, makes one look, as you say, &quot;not very smart&quot;.<br />

This is irrelevant, or rather, it's incorrect. We were never talking about anyone's &quot;inability&quot; to recognize that the game has time-gating. It's about that time-gating is lazy and artificial and whether or not a game utilizes it often isn't the point, the point is that it's fair to criticize or complain about it. I have to fucking spoon feed you this like a baby because you're incapable of paying attention to even a simple argument.<br />

Fuck blizzard and their time gates bullshit up the ass and throat. Seriously. If they want to slow people down fine whatever, but do it through something like rep,, where you can st least get the sense of progression instead of this crap where you just have to meaninglessly wait a week to continue.<br />
<br />
Don't like it? Don't play. You could always just wait until the full thing is out to play it if you hate them that much - options! But my guess, is that you're a whiney little bxtch who complains any which way they can.</div></div><hr />

While we knew we'd wait for content to be released, we didn't know how fuck all this was going to be. Trust me when I say that this was unbelievably disappointing, and the world quests are equally as nothing, they don't even give transmogs, and the &quot;catch up gear&quot; is ilvl 190 so even that is pointless on a barely played alt.</div></div><hr />

You're admitting there's nothing to do, but it doesn't affect you either way because you're already committed to doing other things. This means your opinion on the matter is moot. Smawt :retard smile and thumb to the side:</div></div><hr />

Nobody's forcing you to play the game honestly, and nobody's forcing you to pay for it either - you're choosing to do it. The information about the pre-patch events was put out before the patch went live, so uh, your fault really.</div></div><hr />

Once you do the quest line, you can choose to skip it on alts of the same faction. Have not tried across faction to see though.</div></div><hr />

We already knowing the outcome anyways. Sylvanas is burning the tree to reduce Alliance presence on Kalimdar so they can collect the Azerite. Would be better if this was a repeatable event in some way instead of Argus 2.0 lite edition.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind the gating at the moment. First week, the bugs have to be sorted out and you have to re-configure your characters and stuff. And some people still have to do other things than the prepatch event, either in game or IRL so... Chill down. <br />
<br />
I am not a big fan of gating, but in this case, it does not bother me much. But I am also not invested in the whole &quot;WAR!!!&quot; thing at all. Will do the quests once for the mounts and to see the PoV of both Horde and Alliance, and use WQs to gear up my alts which need gear upgrades, and focus on leveling Allied Races. And the event is not even useful for leveling alts, in comparison to Legion Pre-Patch.</div></div><hr />

I'll probably do it, but that sucks arse, I'll make them pay afterwards, likely stop the sub after the first month of BfA instead of trying to appreciate the expac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no you wont, if you renew your sub the last week before BFA launch you can do all three parts of the quest at once.<br />
also 10 days?<br />
so you will be here for part 2.<br />
<br />
so undercity can be done after BFA launches, but teld cannot so you will be good.<br />
<br />
part 1 24th* cant be done once BFA launches<br />
part 2 31st* cant be done once BFA launches<br />
part 3 7th* Can be done once BFA launches, and is only available early to those who pre-order.</div></div><hr />

No, they're not. However, they have a 24 hour cd. Which, by the way, is absolutely ridiculous. Why in the world does it have a 24 hour cd!? :confused:</div></div><hr />
