<br />
Mage talent trees are starting to shape up!<br />
<br />
Lets review<br />
<br />
ARCANE:<br />
<br />
Improved Mana Shield was renamed to Arcane Shielding, and now increases the reistances of mage armor by 50% as well as the old effect. This means mage armor would resist 60 of every school, and tied in with the arcane talent you could have a base resistance of 130 in every school at level 80.<br />
<br />
They moved that useless armor talent down a teir and put a good talent in its place. Costs 1k mana though, but it increases spell damage by 150 for one minute, no cooldown!<br />
<br />
FIRE:<br />
Improved Scorch now increases damage done by All arcane/fire/frost spells by 2% per stack (10% total) 5% less than before but now it effects all mage spell classes.<br />
<br />
Burning Determination, a 2nd teir fire talent, with both points put into the talent, whenever someone attempts to silence or inturrupt you, you will become immune to All silences and inturrupts for 10 seconds afterwords. This means - rogue kicks your fire spell, you can now cast your arcane/frost spells free of anything stopping you for 10 seconds (except fears or charms)<br />
<br />
Living Bomb now drains mana as well as doing damage based on what was drained.<br />
<br />
FROST:<br />
<br />
A talent that gives ice barrier the same effect as shatter shield was added, for 2 points.<br />
<br />
- This might not be new or i didnt notice it, but the water elemental now heals all party members every 5 sec while out by 1% total hp<br />
<br />
- Deep freeze got teh buff! it now does 1319 to 1531 damage, as a 1.5 second cast it would do around 2k damage if you had 1000 spell damage, and by level 80 i could see this 1.5 sec cast doing at least 2500 - which now makes it good even if your target is not frozen!<br />
<br />
Finally last but not least;<br />
<br />
Glyph of the Penguin - Empowers a Minor Glyph to cause your Polymorph: Sheep spell to turn the target into a baby penguin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many of those glyphs listed are ones you can get by getting glyphs from inscriptionists? How many do YOU have to be the inscription person for? I don't get how it works at all :/<br />
<br />
For example - the penguin. Can I get that from someone else or is that a &quot;BoP&quot; glyph? So my mage would have to be an inscription person? What about all those druid glyphs?</div></div><hr />

i assume they'll be like enchants, all can be sold, but a few special ones that can only be put in certain glyph spots require you to be inscription<br />

Looks like warlock pets are finally getting some scaling - the most odd change is the removal of paranoia and the giving it to the Voidwalker...</div></div><hr />

And the funniest thing is, Demo Roar only costs 10 rage<br />
<br />
Frenzied Regen glyph sounds nice for tanking, though it is sad that a glyph is needed to make this skill actually worthwhile.<br />
Rip and/or Mangle glyph sound like good raid cat ones.<br />
Shred glyph would be worth more in a solo/farm environment, since how often are raid mobs stunned? But w/ Pounce and the improved Maim, this should happen quite often while levelling.<br />
<br />
Oh and of course w00t for Polar Bear! I do hope there will be a Dire Polar Bear, too, instead of just normal bear with a white skin.<br />
Depending on whether the inclusion of normal bear is just a formal one, like on Lacerate (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?spell=48568), or not, this could mean:<br />
at least cosmetic glyphs can be used by lowlevels, and/or<br />
dire bear will be normal bear skin with 'enhancements', either additional overlay textures or armor.</div></div><hr />

It's a debuff that you get when drinking any kind of potion. It will prevent any use of potions for the duration of your current combat situation. Once you leave combat for a &quot;short period of time&quot; the debuff will be removed.<br />
<br />
But this means potion usage for boss fights is limited to 1 potion, be it mana, healing or for example a destruction potion.</div></div><hr />

Shield bash is also off the GCD. <br />
Just tested Earth Shock - it's still on GCD.<br />
Mana is regenerating just as fast as Energy - every 1/10th of a second, and it's also regenerating whilst dead.<br />
I regenerated 100% mana during a corpse run.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't make any sense that shield bash would be off GCD since it is a damage dealing ability. I was under the impression that the reason to remove the damage from pummel was to take it off GCD.</div></div><hr />

There's not enough time to use it in a typical threat cycle anyway. Sword and Board keeps you busy.</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about? I specifically said &quot;If you ever get disarmed.&quot; For example, getting in a shield bash on the untauntable ethereals in Kara can be what keeps them from going off to rape your casters if they aren't paying attention.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's very situational, and on the whole, having it off GCD actually makes it a reliable interrupt, but it's still useful as a threat tool.</div></div><hr />

The art of War isn't even a current talent, I'm a little confused what are you talking about? Or are you complaining about the changes that are taking place in the Beta?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a new talent in WotLK for Retri Paladins, far down in the tree, to the right. It used to make Retri Paladins do massive damage with certain attacks, but was changed so it makes them take 3% less damage from all attacks and gives Hand of Freedom a 100% chance of removing stuns (at 3 points).<br />
<br />
It was a pretty good overall talent (but a bit too powerful) that was changed into a PvP-talent. However, if the talent makes you completely immune to stuns while Hand of Freedom is active, it's pretty damn powerful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't call it &quot;pretty damned powerful&quot;, but I WOULD call it &quot;severely spiky and unreliable&quot;.<br />
<br />
The new one is most important to know whether it's castable WHILE STUNNED (on self, the way Blessing of Protection currently is - although in BoP's case only if the stun would be dispelled by BoP).<br />
If it is NOT castable while stunned, the ability is a complete waste of time. Spending 3 points to save someone else (if you are in range if he is stunned if you see it in time if if if) that far down...<br />
<br />
If it IS, however, it's a pretty damned good PvP ability. Whether it provides immunity for full duration is not really interesting since it's breaking the stun that's important.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Apparently, it IS usable WHILE stunned (on self), but it only REMOVES the stun. That is, no immunity while the hand is active.</div></div><hr />

I think they will be swappable, if not for the hybrids, then for the pvp kids who also want to &quot;raid&quot; on quiet evenings.<br />

The problem with this is. If you are a crafter class, you get specific things for you. Enchanters-ring enchants, JC-enhanced rare gems, alch-alchemist's stone. Having a gathering gives no direct benefit to the character but to ability to get materials. They are trying to give more incentive to make a gathering prof.</div></div><hr />

and beside this is a passive spell not an item you equip or have to active.<br />

you are right about that, but many people then will be running around with a gathering profession. <br />

<br />
The difference being anything that can be made by another profession can be replaced by something better somewhere else. It may be more difficult to get that replacement but nonetheless it CAN be replaced. There is NO replacement or substitute for the self-only ring enchants, adding more slots with self-only enchants would elevate this profession beyond what any other could ever hope to accomplish.</div></div><hr />

Enchanters are getting a crap load of new patterns in the expansion not to mention whatever they will cook up in the Past. The two ring enchants are fine everyone will gain access to glyphs... inscribers will just gain one more no big deal.</div></div><hr />

Enchanting your rings is a profession exclusive not everyone has enchanting so its safe t osay you already have an edge their. Youll have a greater edge if you take up inscription.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not all Proffessions are the same so if you pickup a crafting one your bound to have exclusives. Enchanting is the only profession that doesn't depend on another one. The ring enchants are good and you get to enchant any items you have that in itself is huge. Why should you gain even more advantages while being able to use glyphs like everyone else.</div></div><hr />

And who gives a crap if enchanting is capable of being used on it's own, that's not what this discussion is about. All I'm talking about is the fact that enchanters ONLY get to enchant their rings, while a majority of the other professions keep getting exclusive items to make for themselves which are far better for them than what enchanters can do for their rings.</div></div><hr />
