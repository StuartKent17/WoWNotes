Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
I’ve noticed in a lot of competitive games; Mobas, shooters, sometimes MMORPGS, that people talk a lot about this hidden stat called MMR a lot. Often they go to external websites to see what it is or how to manipulate it or whatnot. My question is that why is the MMR stat not visible within the game, anywhere? For example, in hots last season I made gold 3. Yet I was being placed with Plats and silvers sometimes and asked “What, is my MMR too high/low? How do i find out what it is?<br />
MMR (matchmaking rating) is a tool that developers use to try and give you a good experience by finding players of similar skill for your team and the other team. If skills on your team are radically different, then you can’t do things like coordinate with your team for awesome combos. If skills between your team and the other team are radically different, it tends to mean you win or lose games not because you made good decisions, but because the teams were just super lopsided.<br />
<br />
It may sound weird, but MMR isn’t really something you are supposed to get better at. I know, heresy, right? Realistically, players do tend to get better, because playing more games does tend to make you better at something. But there is probably a cap. While it is aspirational to think that if you just keep playing League games that you could one day go pro, but for the vast majority of players that’s just not going to happen.<br />
<br />
Exposing MMR sets the expectation with players that it’s a bar that they are supposed to fill up, like an experience bar, high score, or some other form of progression. Even worse, it can lead players to make decisions to try to get their MMR to change, not decisions that help to win the game. Players, being players, try to game their MMR. And if the matchmaking system is doing its job, everyone in your game should be close to the same MMR anyway. Just remember that MMR isn’t deterministic. You shouldn’t assume you’re going to beat someone with a lower MMR just because their rating is lower than yours, and it doesn’t mean matchmaking is “broken” when you are occasionally matched with someone with a different MMR, and it doesn’t mean MMR is broken if you can’t beat someone with a lower MMR than you. For all of these reasons, it’s better just to keep it hidden and not a big topic of conversation. <br />
<br />
TLDR, MMR is not something players are supposed to focus on - it’s a developer tool, not a player metric. Think of MMR as something like frame rate, or IP address - something mostly behind the scenes. <br />
<br />
Instead, focus on your rank. If you are Gold 3, that’s the measurement of your progression. If you win more games than you lose, maybe you can get to Platinum. (Source (https://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/159504857223/ive-noticed-in-a-lot-of-competitive-games))<br />

Pretty sure M'uru and H Rag were both around 500+ attempts, but this one is definitely up there.<br />

Not sure how much time was wasted on C'thun when it was bugged and actually impossible to kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Muru was killed within 4 days from opening second sunwell gate, by SK gaming. I dont think that was 500+ attemps, but it could be, cant find info on that.<br />
<br />
Cthun stayed alive for 86 days from twin emperors death, Ouro 87 from twins death. (Cthun died 1 day after patch then Ouro so that makes Ouro harder than Cthun)<br />
<br />
Original Ragnaros from Molten Core stayed alive only 74 days from majordomo's death but overall 154 days from molten core opening which is longest lasting raid instance ever.<br />
<br />
Kaelthas over month to kill and Alar even more, Keal was killed after release of Black Temple.</div></div><hr />

No he isn't, but he is the most vocal one. Far greater talents in gaming than him just don't feel the thirst for attention and glorifying than this guy has.

Being vocal takes a lot of guts. Either way, why hate on him? He's very experienced, most of the questions he answers are well-reasoned and, at least in my opinion, interesting to read. I wish more developers did what he does. :-) Also, he's (and also has been) a leader of very large teams, obviously he's not an &quot;inventor of game mechanics&quot; or anything like that, but directing a vision and managing large teams is a feat in itself. His social and commucative skills in particular are top-notch. I think he's a bit underated and gets unecessary hate. :-/</div></div><hr />

Calling his posts &quot;tirades&quot; is more than a bit disingenuous. If you don't like him, or his posts, fine, but do you really need to mischaracterize his comments like that?<br />

Because Chaud likes to post them. Take it up with him. And in email, so we don' have to wade through the nonsense.</div></div><hr />

The jaded toxic experts don't appear in between your Blizzard news on the front page, do they? But apparently the posts of someone who doesn't work at Blizzard, doesn't even play WoW for years, but still feels the need to go onto lengthy explanations on how things were deserves front page, right next to actual Blizzard posts and Blizzard game news. And now his posts which aren't even related get posted too! Why don't you form a Ghostcrawler fan club and go about praising him? And what's &quot;everything&quot; and &quot;everyone&quot; I am apparently hating &quot;all day&quot;? Right, I am expressing my total annoyance at the systematic stroking the ego of a developer &quot;celebrity&quot; who quit Blizzard and is as irrelevant to WoW today as is anyone not in the team, sorry if it offends you.</div></div><hr />

Still people interested in his insight can use twitter or some other social media where he post. His quotes can see place in websites for LoL or Moba since he works on them now. <br />
So there is no place for him here just bias.</div></div><hr />

I wonder when people are going to realize this site isn't dedicated to JUST WoW. There are things posted all the time for other blizzard titles. Also, he's a developer. He has insight into things that the typical gamer might be interested in knowing about, certain processes and things that were done while he was at Blizzard and his opinions on how things have evolved since then. I really don't get how this is so damned hard to understand and figure out.</div></div><hr />
