Blizzard finally posted a small preview of the Patch 4.1 content, confirming the updated skin of the Amani War Bear (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/33809/amani-war-bear/) in the process. <br />
In years past, the Zandalar tribe, encompassing the wise and scholarly progenitors of the trolls, heroically assisted the Horde and the Alliance with thwarting the nefarious activities of their brethren in Zul'Gurub and Zul'Drak. Yet the chaos unleashed by the recent Cataclysm has reshaped the Zandalari's philosophy about the world and the dwindling remnants of their race. Led by a mysterious prophet known only as Zul, the Zandalari have issued a call to Azeroth's embattled troll populations: unite into a single mighty empire and save their race from extinction.<br />
<br />
Thus far, the Gurubashi and Amani trolls have answered the summons and received aid from the Zandalari, allowing them to rebuild their respective capitals in Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman. Not all trolls, however, have so eagerly adopted the Zandalari's grandiose vision of a new troll empire. Vol'jin and his Darkspear tribe are opposed to the warmongering espoused by Zul. To prevent the burgeoning Gurubashi and Amani troll forces from wreaking havoc on Azeroth, Vol'jin has reached out to his Horde comrades and members of the Alliance for assistance. Should the Darkspears' campaign fail, a new troll empire shall rise and bring war to a world already beset by suffering and conflict.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
A Threat Fought in Secret<br />
<br />
Using a great deal of discretion, Vol’jin has dispatched Darkspear delegates to the capital cities of Stormwind and Orgrimmar calling for all able-bodied adventurers to investigate recent threats that have risen in the jungles of Stranglethorn.<br />
<br />
The outlook isn't good. The Gurubashi tribe, their strength renewed, is running rampant throughout Stranglethorn. Players will have a chance to embark on all-new level-85 solo quests in Stranglethorn and will discover exactly what tribulations lie ahead -- Gurubashi leadership is still largely intact and rehabilitated through the new union with the Zandalari. Along the way, players will assist a sassy, headstrong Darkspear spirit-talker named Bwemba, they'll track down the elusive Hemet Nesingwary, and they'll encounter many of the new Zul'Gurub bosses throughout the steaming jungles of Stranglethorn.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Rewards for addressing the issues in Stranglethorn include an adorable panther pet of your own to care for. Players should seek out Vol'jin's representatives in Orgrimmar or Stormwind Harbor to begin their adventure.<br />
<br />
<br />
Return to Zul'Gurub<br />
<br />
This ancient city has once again become the staging grounds for an empowered Gurubashi people to strike against those who they perceive to be invading their ancestral lands. Now backed by the Zandalari, the Gurubashi present all-new challenges for players in this level-85 5-player Heroic dungeon. While players may see some familiar faces in this dungeon, the encounters and fight mechanics have been considerably updated. For allying yourself with the Darkspears, High Priest Venoxis, Broodlord Mandokir, High Priestess Kilnara, Zanzil, and Jin'do the Godbreaker would like to make one thing clear -- your intrusion will cost you. Take their heads and you’ll be presented with a treasure map. You’ll want to seek out its precious booty, including an account-bound ring with a gem so big it’s visible when worn!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/march/5SHPOVOGO1S21301055470994_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/march/5SHPOVOGO1S21301055470994.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/march/LPL4NIIUHBL51301055505276_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/march/LPL4NIIUHBL51301055505276.jpg)<br />
<br />
Also, for those with a high enough Archaeology skill, an additional boss can be unlocked in Zul’Gurub. Gri'lek, Renataki, Hazza'rah, and Wushoolay will be randomly selected to put an end to those who dig too deep for greater riches. Should your group survive the challenge, you'll unearth a selection of rewards available from any of the four bosses, as well as loot unique to each boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Amani Regrouped<br />
<br />
With the aid of the Zandalari, the remaining Amani have reassembled under new, sturdy leadership in Daakara. Zul'Aman has been converted into a challenging level-85 5-player Heroic dungeon. For those who fought Zul'jin back during The Burning Crusade, much of the dungeon will feel similar, but the mechanics have been updated to suit a 5-player group. Akil'zon, Nalorakk, Jan'alai, Halazzi, Hex Lord Malacrass, and Daakara look to bring their tribe out of hiding and into the spotlight as a force to be reckoned with. Challengers beware.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/march/HEJ88D2N8E8T1301055544676_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/march/HEJ88D2N8E8T1301055544676.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/march/Z3F4I7OMGPOT1301055575708_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/march/Z3F4I7OMGPOT1301055575708.jpg)<br />
<br />
Both Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub will require players to have a minimum average item level of 346 before they can enter. These two Heroic dungeons will exist in a separate Heroic difficulty tier in the Dungeon Finder, above the current Cataclysm Heroic dungeons. In return, they will offer players item level 353 epic-quality loot. Players can expect to find items for nearly every gear slot available in these two dungeons, though much focus has been placed on offering players itemization for hard-to-fill slots or specializations, such as bracers, helms, shoulders, guns, and wands.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rare Mounts and More<br />
<br />
As with the original iterations of Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman, players will have a chance to obtain updated rare mounts. The Swift Zulian Panther and Armored Razzashi Raptor are obtained in Zul'Gurub, while the Amani Battle Bear can be earned by killing the first four bosses of Zul'Aman in a limited amount of time.<br />
<br />

<br />
The interests of the Zandalari no longer align with your own. Vol'jin needs your help to stop this play for power. Will you rise to the challenge?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't read any reports from the PTR, but is the battle bear a guaranteed drop if you meet certain metrics in the dungeon? I suspect it is like all the other dungeon mounts with 1% drop rate. We'll see some, but not a lot of them. I don't see that many Vortex or Stonecore drakes out in the wild.<br />
<br />
Edit: &quot;can be earned by killing the first four bosses of Zul'Aman in a limited amount of time.&quot;<br />

Ok, I stand corrected. It is officially the new bronze drake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well as I see it, it's more that there isn't any Sandfury left. I mean we did, in Cataclysm, clear the entire place out, and had quests to clear to place out, so it doesn't really make sense if they suddenly got new leadership. I'm pretty sure we managed to commit genocide on just about their entire race.<br />
<br />
And even if that's not true, it says, &quot;Thus far, the Gurubashi and Amani trolls have answered the summons and received aid from the Zandalari&quot; which implies that the Zandalari are just sort of goin, &quot;Party at ojur place, we provide drinks and snacks, all trolls welcome.&quot; The Sandfury may not have even wanted to come.<br />
<br />
Oh and keep in mind that the Sandfury are also on the other continent. That's a bit of a problem.</div></div><hr />

i agree with what you say (you forgot the Elemental Invasion Dungeon fact, but whatever), except the last one, the Zandalari tribe lives on an island, which means they probaly can sail to both continents. the fact that its an island even make me more sure that next expansion will be Azshara and Naga + maybe Emerald Dream + islands and lots of water in the middle of the sea, where the trolls can fit in later. they also talked about &quot;World Travelling&quot; at some point, and i guess they wanna clear out Azeroth before they take out the big World Travel.<br />

Yeah, it was &quot;hard&quot; for about a week, after that it was pugged several times each week on most of my alts realms.. Nothing big about it.<br />
<br />
Too all the people who're being all &quot;New bear is just a re-colored version of the old.. Now I'm not going to look unique while standing in OG/SW&quot;, - please. I have the old bear and I'm happy about the change. Now my alts can have a similar bear for the same effort. (Spending 20-50 minutes in a dungeon or raid, no big deal).</div></div><hr />

I personally cant wait to get to do Zul'gurub again, not all that fuzzed over zul'aman however.<br />

Oh well, the exclusivity was nice while it lasted.<br />
<br />
On a more serious note though, does anyone else find it tenuous that Voljin would reach out to the Alliance as well as the Horde? I mean, trolls are usually viewed as savages by the Alliance in any literature I've read. I can't imagine Voljin getting audience with Varian Wrynn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wasn't trivial at all, and cmon we all know what expansion we are, it will be difficult for first 2 days and then after QQ from mama's boys its gonna get nerfed to ground<br />
<br />
i'm expecting something like this on release: beat the timed run under 30 minutes to recieve this mount, and 3 days later: beat timed run under 2 hours to recieve this mount...cause franly thats how this game operates now<br />
<br />

A lot of people didn't get to see Zul'Aman during BC, and a LOT more people didn't get to experience 20-man Zul'Gurub. Just because you've played through it doesn't mean that everyone else has.

According to Vol'jin's dialog in the Ghostlands, Rastakhan is at least complicit with Zul's message.<br />
<br />
On a related not the term &quot;Zul&quot; generally means &quot;great&quot;, so Zul'Gurub probably translates roughly as &quot;Great City of the Gurubasi&quot;. This means the new prophet of the Zandalar is literally called &quot;Great Prophet&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you read the article? <br />
<br />
<br />
while the Amani Battle Bear can be earned by killing the first four bosses of Zul'Aman in a limited amount of time<br />
<br />
Trivial? That depends on how long they give you, how good your gear is, and your skill.<br />
<br />
At this point comparing it to a heroic instance (CoT) that was rendered trivial to people running it with gear an order of magnitude above it probably isn't fair. Consider for a moment that these dungeons are going to be &quot;harder&quot; than current heroics, I suspect that geared guild groups and competant pugs will find it trivial. while the masses will fill the forums with QQ that this mount isn't easily obtainable for casuals.</div></div><hr />

not really no, in the first month or two everyone who wanted it had it, but those that didn't want it at all got it anyway later on cause it was impossible to fail and even if you failed rest of the players carried the group</div></div><hr />

Never mind the fact they were pushed into this position because of the other races i mean Stormwind is practically next door. <br />
<br />
On top of that the story says that the Zandalari fear their race becoming extinct so they want to pool their populace and secure their destiny and immediately that's bad and must be exterminated for good, looks like a natural retreat strategy.<br />

<br />
This mysterious &quot;Zul&quot; that now leads the Zandalar tribe is in fact either a) an old god in one of his humanoid (troll obv) forms (strong possibility as N'zoth speculation leads to the belief he is based around Lovecraft's character who wanders around as a tall, slender humanoid, cant remember the name atm) or b) a troll under the influence of the old god we fight in this xpac.<br />
<br />
I'm kinda also thinking these two 5-mans are really only the beginning of troll lore in this xpac, hopefully leading to a new raid. I'm thinking like the Zandalar have secretly built a massive city while we were dealing with the Gurubashi and Amani tribes, and now pose a massive threat.</div></div><hr />

Oh enough people had it allright, even early on.<br />
<br />
Nearly none, besides the top guild on each server got the amani war bear early on, PLENTY bought it from those guilds. And many more farmed it alter on. <br />
It have always been like that, and will always be like it.<br />

Did you even read the bluepost about the instances? The story *IS* being moved forward. Zanzil rezzes some of the priests, while you (if you do northern STV quests) are responsible for Mando'kir's resurrection.<br />
<br />
The zandalar (overseeing council of all trolls) faction is moving from opposing Hakkar to a polar-opposite stance of trying to bring Hakkar back AND wage war upon Azeroth once again. Again, story moving forward--a new prophet is stirring the troll empires (one of the oldest common foes of horde/alliance on Azeroth) into action again after basically sitting back and letting heroes wipe them out tribe by tribe.</div></div><hr />

Nothing was stopping you from going into either instance and doing the content and experiencing the raids, oh was it too easy with your WoTLK kiddie gear and you wanted a challenge? They weren't much of a challenge to begin with anyways other then the timed bear runs, and those were not much of a challenge with people in BT/Hyjal gear. So they reskin an entire instance and a mount, and I'm sure they will reskin some of the items and gear that drop inside as well, because that's what Blizzard likes to do. But eat it up, I'm sure they are happy you are so easily pacified while Blizzard sits there doing minimal effort and reaping in tons of rewards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if Blizzard do decide to make it difficult, putting it in now means there's ~3 more teirs of gear going to be avaliable in this expansion, making it considerably easier to get every time a new raid comes out, especially considering that 980 VP weekly cap from heroics makes getting raid geared from heroics alone even easier than it was in WotLK.<br />

<br />
<br />
yet... we are fighting the same characters all over again (entire zul'aman), and almost entire zul'gurub again, with slightly updated versions of their abilities...<br />
<br />
&quot;durp, we cba to create new lore, so lets take existing lore we alrdy finished, re-polish it, and call it moving the story forward&quot;... the least they could have done if they wanted to re-use ZG and ZA was to invent new bosses, with new abilities, not the same shit slightly polished<br />
<br />
mandorkin is a great example, the fight is virtually the same, except now he 1 shots people insted of his &quot;gaze&quot;, and his raptor actually does something... like killing the ghosts, but it's the same shit, it's unoriginal, blend and boring to re-do what we alrdy did 5 years ago<br />
<br />
i'm sorry you weren't here, but there are prolly millions of us still playing from vanilla times, that are craving for NEW content, not recycled-repolished content<br />
<br />
and no, these dungeons do not count as &quot;NEW&quot;, just like onyxia anaversity gift in wotlk was not NEW content... they could have released ZG/ZA as a similar thingy as ony lair in wotlk, rather then a pointless content patch of it's own.</div></div><hr />

People aren't realizing that it wasn't really the time restraint that made the old War Bear rare. It was that ZA was on a 3 day lock-out and only ONE person got the mount on each run.<br />
<br />
Now, you can do H ZA as many times a day as you want (via Random DF) and if you take the same 5 people you'll all have within 2 days.<br />
<br />
...then you can all start on your alts obtaining the mount for the next two days!</div></div><hr />

You'll never get 100%, so there will always be something that someone never saw. Wich doesn't mean that it should be recycled. A lot of players experienced ZG, be it at lvl 60 or just doing rep grind/mount grind runs. The same way ppl do MC for example... should we get a revamped heroic 5-man MC? No.<br />
<br />
Ppl solo (or almost) TK for the mount, should we get heroic 5man Tempest Keep? No.<br />
<br />
Same for &quot;player favorites&quot; (as they judged ZA/ZG) like Karazhan, AQ40... no need to recycle it as 5man heroics. The game story must move on as some ppl love to claim... so, new stuff, please, before we get to fight Bolvar in the &quot;fan favorite&quot; Heroic 5-man Icecrown Citadel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can speculate just as much as you can, assuming it'll be trivial with guild groups, and others/pugs will QQ it's too hard, etc. I agree with that. But.. saying, &quot;That depends on how long they give you, how good your gear is, and your skill.&quot; doesn't help. That's a statement you could say about almost *anything*. Thanks for trying, though.<br />
<br />
But ... you asked for someone to speculate. Asking if something is trivial is a subjective question completely dependant on a persons opinion.<br />
<br />
Is knitting a hat trivial?<br />
<br />
my grandmother would respond: yes<br />
i would respond: no<br />

<br />
No, it wasn't possible to faceroll your way to the drake at the begining. You had to pay attention and play correctly to reach it in time. After everyone in the world were decked in 213 gear (wich was enough to outgear everything that wasn't Sartharion 3D), then it was faceroll to reach it, but the &quot;impossible to fail&quot; only came after that, because even there, some players were born in the &quot;fail star&quot; and failed.</div></div><hr />

Never mind the fact they were pushed into this position because of the other races i mean Stormwind is practically next door. <br />
<br />
On top of that the story says that the Zandalari fear their race becoming extinct so they want to pool their populace and secure their destiny and immediately that's bad and must be exterminated for good, looks like a natural retreat strategy.<br />
<br />
Also that cub looks cute :p<br />
<br />
Yeah... strange things... horde boss calling for alliance help (hey, you killed me for some achiev, but hey, help me), Zandalari together with gurubashi...

Perhaps, because they realised removing mounts from the game is not a good thing. I would be willing to bet the majority of the wow player base would prefer mounts not to be removed. Sure the whole *special little snowflake* crowd are gonna get upset. But there are people who have only recently started playing and no chance to even get a mount that had been removed. Some awesome mount models out there, why remove them? <br />

<br />
<br />
i hope and i have a gut feeling it will be coming this wedensday <br />
<br />
couple of reasons im sure many many people have already posted on the forums<br />
<br />
<br />
1: with firelands and daily hub etc not on 4.1 there was a lot less to test<br />
<br />
2: they probabbly had a set date to release 4.1 (i.e last wedensday of march) well before firelands was pushed back to 4.2, so they said screw it lets keep the date we decided on...even tho there was not much to test and we cud have got it out sooner<br />
<br />
3a: 4.2 most probs wont be out for another 6-8 weeks after 4.1...which will be 6mths after cata release and blizz will be behind on releasing the next tier of pvp/pve gear and content<br />
<br />
3b: to get people in 353 gear asap to get bosses down in current raids <br />
<br />
4: to make us all happy :)<br />
<br />
but hey i could be completely wrong and im just hoping <br />

I would rather settle for it being a retardedly low drop chance from drakka (skadi drop ect) the last thing i want to see and i'm sure some TBC players will agree is everyone and there mum using a reskinned version of the mounts we had to work hard to gain, seriously blizzard can go to hell.</div></div><hr />

Guess what? Your ZA bear from BC is still unobtainable. You will still be able to see who got it when ZA was a lvl 70 raid. You'll still be able to know who got it the hard way. Your achievement won't be mysteriously gone.<br />
<br />
And who knows? Maybe the timer for the new ZA bear wont be as ridiculously easy as the timer for the Bronze Drake so that even a pug with DPS doing 5k DPS can get it.<br />
<br />
And anyway, why the hell do you people care? Most of you are probably not even using it anymore and if you sometimes do, it's just in Tol Barad, battlegrounds and the rare instances that allow it. Everywhere else, people use flying mounts.</div></div><hr />

That's like saying every mount in this game is rare because you have different colors of it. The skin is what makes it unique and rare. <br />

I worked pretty hard to get my ICC drake. There is a total influx of players now that have them. That's fine. If Blizz had said they were taking them away, and then in a couple of years, they magically bring them back in WoW4 : The Revenge of Bolvar and Illidian Stormage that takes place on an even further Cataclysmed Dreanor, will I care? Not really tbh. I'll be too busy working to get the current Tier mount I'm sure. <br />
<br />

<br />
So it's not enough for you that you have one of .... 5?....mounts in the game that can no longer be acquired? I'm not counting the card game reward mounts, since they were always limited on the total amount available. I mean, I could understand being upset if the recolor was a somewhat different shade of red, barely distinguishable from the original coloring. Or if they were adding the original warbear back into the original raid so that a full 10-man of 85s could get one in about 5 minutes. But there is no way that anyone would mistake your bear for the new one.<br />
<br />
I'm not really sure why you are surprised. It's not like they haven't been doing this pretty much since WoW existed. The only reason we didn't see a recolored warbear before now is that there was no troll raid in Wrath and they already had a timed run in a heroic with the bronze drake. Seriously, if having something that it totally not like anything anyone else (or at least very very few people) has is THAT important to you, you might want to look at another game, because WoW is just going to continuously disappoint you.</div></div><hr />

If I recall correctly pretty much nobody had that drake until everyone massively outgeared the instance.<br />
<br />
i was going to say exactly this. it wasnt very often i seen someone facerolling to the bronze drake mount during tier 7 or 8. when toc hit, everyone and their mother got the mount and you know what WHO CARES?<br />
<br />
why is it such a big deal to feel so epic having a &quot;rare&quot; mount, it doesnt make you cool, it doesnt make you unique considering that most rare mounts are farmed so much that lost of people end up with them anyways. while you are struting around org on your &quot;rare&quot; mount i will be out playing the game and doing other stuff instead of drooling over what you have because it means nothing to most players.<br />
<br />
either way it goes back to the arguement of how easy wrath heroics supposidly were, when we out geared them by at least 3 tiers. so many call it stuff easy when they out gear it, in fact thats already happening again in cata. 2 months ago dungeons were hard and again players are saying its faceroll again. its an endless cycle.</div></div><hr />

So there may be some facts I'm not aware of but wait a minute. The Zandalari, the progenitor race of trolls, are looking to unite all troll tribes under a single empire. Trolls would finally have a proper civilisation instead of the current barbaric tribes (minus Darkspear) fighting with each other and a chance to build their history once again... But instead of becoming a prominent figure within this new society to finally improve relations with trolls and the rest of the world, Vol'jin chooses to side with... Garrosh, the same guy who he swore he would kill?<br />
<br />
I thought the Zandalari were the best and brightest of their race, yet they become some sort of looneys or whatever, I guess that's the reason we're all out to kill them? :/ It would have made MUCH more sense to have the Horde and the Alliance aiding the Zandalari in Zuldazar, leading up to Vol'jin teaming up with Rhastakhan and thus creating a link between the Horde and the rest of the troll tribes, since Rhastakhan has the ultimate command of what goes down with the trolls, uncivilised as some of them may be.<br />

Troll lore continues to make sense, as always. /sarcasm</div></div><hr />

If they took out all the Proto drakes and told everyone that they would not return, only to find out 2 years later its returned with the same skin and different color. Then yes they have a right to.<br />
<br />
You obviously dont grasp the concept that the TBC bear is STILL UNOBTAINABLE, they even gave it a diffrent name for christ sake. They should really shit on the old players by not allowing them to obtain this mount that they are bitching about so much, would make me happy :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocfcdfd48e5e</div><div class="date">2011-03-25, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright... So there may be some facts I'm not aware of but wait a minute. The Zandalari, the progenitor race of trolls, are looking to unite all troll tribes under a single empire. Trolls would finally have a proper civilisation instead of the current barbaric tribes (minus Darkspear) fighting with each other and a chance to build their history once again... But instead of becoming a prominent figure within this new society to finally improve relations with trolls and the rest of the world, Vol'jin chooses to side with... Garrosh, the same guy who he swore he would kill?<br />
<br />
I thought the Zandalari were the best and brightest of their race, yet they become some sort of looneys or whatever, I guess that's the reason we're all out to kill them? :/ It would have made MUCH more sense to have the Horde and the Alliance aiding the Zandalari in Zuldazar, leading up to Vol'jin teaming up with Rhastakhan and thus creating a link between the Horde and the rest of the troll tribes, since Rhastakhan has the ultimate command of what goes down with the trolls, uncivilised as some of them may be.<br />
<br />
Troll lore continues to make sense, as always. /sarcasm<br />
<br />
They are obviously preparing everything for the main attraction of this patch as Blizzard clearly stated as &quot;a scary surprise&quot;. Rhonin flying on Deathwing's back as the wind caress his flaming red hair as he picks up his helpless High Elf &quot;princess&quot; (since Sylvanas is queen, that makes her the princess lawl) getting dirty as they fly over Silvermoon making it explode with the fires of Rhonin's loyal new sidekick.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then a raptor army will seek redemption and become Alliance's new race as epic armour and weapons hatch from their eggs. It will be the most glorious moment in the history of subscribers currently online ever! Haters are going to hate and will be answered with a &quot;Do a game of your own if you don't like this awesomeness, blasphemer!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
As an example the ICC meta drakes could've been replaced with drakes of a slightly different name, and perhaps with a slight recolour, as the patch 4.0.1 came. They ended up reasonably trivial by the end of the tier and were being sold in great numbers, but I know a good bunch who are bothered by how something they fought hard for is easily obtainable to everyone. On the other hand, the model on the wyrms is very attractive so the people who weren't able to get there would be able to get a mount that looks the same.<br />
<br />
This sort of a solution could very well satisfy many on both sides of the issue.</div></div><hr />

I almost knew you'd respond to this, purely because it's what you consider your claim to fame to be.<br />
<br />
I guess the point is this--for every player that cares about feeling special on a mount, there's a player who doesn't care. The difference being, the players who care QQ anytime something like this pops up, and the players who don't roll their eyes at the QQ.<br />
<br />
I don't know where you got &quot;special&quot; to be threatening or offensive to me. What's annoying is the incessant QQ.<br />

<br />
I worked pretty hard to get my ICC drake. There is a total influx of players now that have them. That's fine. If Blizz had said they were taking them away, and then in a couple of years, they magically bring them back in WoW4 : The Revenge of Bolvar and Illidian Stormage that takes place on an even further Cataclysmed Dreanor, will I care? Not really tbh. I'll be too busy working to get the current Tier mount I'm sure. <br />

<br />
I'm sorry, but this is just not true. It was not trivial. Even in Hyjal and BT gear, the timer was a challenge and required specific group make-ups. Please don't spread misinformation like its gospel. Speaking for myself, when my guild group finished getting everyone their bears, we had already downed Illidan, Archi, and were ready to step into Sunwell any day. None of the gear save maybe 1 or 2 pieces here and there were upgrades at all, but the demand on a 10 man group in that instance was high. The timer was so close you had to avoid packs, CC packs or you would immediately wipe or be pushed into more mobs and wiped, etc. The boss encounters were not tuned for difficulty in the sense they had humongous health pools or the tanks would get creamed, but each boss had specific abilities which called upon each member to perform their roles nigh-flawlessly. One single fuck up on the dragonhawks could cost you, and likely did cost you here and there. Healing on the bear boss was intense for quite a while and don't even get me started on Akil'zon and his adds. <br />
<br />
Please. Only a person with no bear mount or little experience doing the instance when it first came out would play it off like it was a joke. ZA was a perfectly tuned instance marred only by the fact it came at a strange time and likely should've come out at the same time as Hyjal and BT.</div></div><hr />

Historically, Zandalar was the meeting place of all trolls, even warring tribes, as common people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trolls dominate Zandalar, all trolls, from jungle to ice, consider Zandalar their homeland. It is neutral territory for their kind, so trolls don’t battle each other when on Zandalar. The same courtesy doesn’t extend toward other races, though, and Zandalar’s trolls are a wicked and voodoo-worshipping bunch who delight in slaying their enemies and devouring their remains. &quot; (Qtd. on wowpedia, in turn quoting Lands of Mystery, the Warcraft RPG reference atlas)<br />
<br />
I don't know where people are getting this version of Zandalari trolls as &quot;peaceful&quot; just because they're noted as &quot;scholarly.&quot; They're not. They're just the particular tribe of trolls that tries to unite all troll races, despite tribal tensions. I admit it is a bit perplexing that they would have us wipe out ZG only to decide to bring it back, but I suspect that what others have said (elder god influence through this new Zul figure) is probably what explains it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, considering that Zandalar, at least on that map (noticeably absent on the WoW maps) is located right next to the maelstrom, the Cataclysm would likely have been an extremelyupsetting event for them. Add that to the fact that the Alliance and Horde have systematically wiped out every major tribe/empire on the continents and you have a crisis that would stir a nation into extreme action. Trolls have been around a looooooooooong time, mon!</div></div><hr />

I do like the new questlines for ZG though. Except that it's a bit confusing that we were allied with the Zandalari and now we're fighting against them. It just proves that you can never trust a Troll.<br />

<br />
The bronze drake was completely effortless in every way.<br />
<br />
The war bear took thought and most of all dedication. It wasn't just &quot;if you wipe you lose,&quot; you had to go so fast that you needed to pull multiple trash mobs(that really knew how to hurt) and alter your boss strategies to get them done quicker. Most groups failed their first few weeks. The skill-set required to pull it off is way way above the skills of (average) players today. <br />
<br />
Then when you finally did get it you had to hold your group together until all 12-13 people that had contributed got it. You failed a few times on those tries to. And for most guilds, this meant doing an additional 2-3 RAIDS A WEEK on top of what was your normal raiding schedule(assuming you were doing 25s). <br />
<br />
So the war bear did mean something. Of course some groups got good at it and did some alts runs, and black temple came out and made it easier with gear. But even toward the very end if you didn't have some serious experience in your groups you weren't going to get it. Yes I'm sure you have some great story about how you pugged it and it was soo easy but I can tell you from extensive experience that that was not the norm.<br />
<br />
Now the new bear might(will probably) be bronze drake easy, but if its not you are in for a serious reality check.</div></div><hr />

Well, from what I've seen of the Zandalari in LK as well as in ZG as far as trolls go they tend to have a hands off approch, unless they are going to do something amazingly stupid...like bring in the Blood God, or kill off all their primal gods. Basicly, if a troll race is going to do something stupid they genicide them and collect their artifacts to teach the other tribes not to do this crap again. Now it would appear as they want to reunite their troll bretheren rather than wipe them out. Instead of being hands off and teaching future trolls, they have decided to take the lead and reunite the trolls. Honestly, if they weren't so evil and hateful it would be a good thing. lol What has me wondering is...is this the end of the story? What about the Drakkari? Or even going to the Zandilari home land?</div></div><hr />

You don't know how easy it will be to kill those bosses in time... I don't see many Volcanic Stone Drakes around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it will all be faceroll after 3 tiers of gear... suck it up.. Bronze Drake was pretty hard until after the ulduar patch.. I know pugs still wiped on the last stretch alot.. sure after uld and totc it was a cakewalk.. as blizz said the biggest nerf of everything is gear.. nothing is going to stay hard aslong as people get new gear and try new raids, its like people don't understand this..</div></div><hr />

Everyone just had to get a good group to get the old Amani Bear und almost certainly got the bear after 2-3 months, and if this didn't work you can now get nearly the very same bear. But if you went into ZG for years but din't get the Tiger, you can now get a Mount which looks almost exactly like a mount everyone can get in Darnassus for almost free, and which is completely uncomparable with the old Tiger. It did not have to be the old Tiger, but as a Player who visited ZG for Years and got no mount i am very disappointed that Blizzard didn't even try to make a mount that looks at least a bit as awesome as the old Swift Zulian Tiger.</div></div><hr />

The Shattering. Here is your explanation.<br />
<br />
Political and diplomatic map changing is a common thing on our own world, why is so hard to believe it on WoW? Heck, a Tunisian fruit vendor imulated himself and 3 months later the entire Arab region is in massive upveal, with NATO bombing a country. One simple Tunisian fruit vendor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the recoloring is so minor, you won't even know who has the old one and the new one. Kind of sad really. I don't even have the old one and I would rather a new bear model than a 10 minute photoshop job. Atleast change the armor shit on it to something new.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still it was a travial task compared to the original shattred halls heroic pre-nerf for your t5 attunement or the original ony quest (ubrs 5-man anyone?).<br />
Though I admit I would bet money on it that it will be a new bronze dragon, you have to admit that it does not need to be.<br />

<br />
A lot of people didn't get to see Zul'Aman during BC, and a LOT more people didn't get to experience 20-man Zul'Gurub. Just because you've played through it doesn't mean that everyone else has. In fact, I'd be willing to bet my left nipple that the number of people haven't been in those two instances dwarfs the number of those that have. For example, I haven't seen either one of them. I'm happy.<br />
<br />
And why you are happy? Even with the reuse of the instances you still won´t have played zul gurub or zul aman? It´s just the same like nax, some cynic guys say even that nax was a better experience at level 70 than at level 80. It was for sure harder. <br />
(yes, I am aware that I was first at level 60 in the instance)<br />

Did you read the article? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Trivial? That depends on how long they give you, how good your gear is, and your skill.<br />
<br />
At this point comparing it to a heroic instance (CoT) that was rendered trivial to people running it with gear an order of magnitude above it probably isn't fair. Consider for a moment that these dungeons are going to be &quot;harder&quot; than current heroics, I suspect that geared guild groups and competant pugs will find it trivial. while the masses will fill the forums with QQ that this mount isn't easily obtainable for casuals.<br />
<br />
Oh, sorry about that, I did not know that we were overgeared with t6, questgear und bc-heroic gear on our first run there, I am so sorry that it was only trivial because of our impressiv gear. /sarcasm<br />

And it makes no sense, it's totally disjointed/out of the blue. Even a fantasy world needs to be reasonably internally consistent, the plot needs to be plausible if it is to be consistent. <br />
<br />
Also see: Star Control 3<br />
<br />
They gave consistancy up in this addon. Either that or the quest designers are using way to much crack when doing the goblin quests which lack any consistancy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I collect vanity items for vanity!. That means I get a chance to stand out. War Bears were relatively rare. With this Bronze Drake kind of way to obtain it, how special will it be? Please don't give me the usual &quot;Ride it because it looks cool, not because it's rare&quot;. I don't care about that. My good old War Bear will not really be recognizable with dungeon newbies flexing their new Battle Bears. <br />
All it needs is a Feat of Strength, then it's just fantastic.... I'm so disappointed. Can't express it. I feel like saying &quot;f*ck Blizzard&quot; for this. I'm generally fairly happy with them, but not lately. This is just too much. The game is taking a wrong turn. <br />
I realize it has become a lot friendlier to beginners, and that's not bad, but it's killing it for me and I believe a lot of other players feel the same way. Quests does not involve thinking the slightest or exploring. You open your map and find the shortest way to your desired area. Recipes that require exotic materials have been changed to require more common materials and nothing that would actually have you travel 10 minutes, just to get a few things. I feel that the quality of quests has also decreased. Again, it's simpler, but just less fun. You don't even have to know where north, west, south and east are. Just follow your GPS and autofly. There were absolutely stunning quests before the Burning Crusade. I know they were very difficult to complete, but even at level 80 they were so epic. They were long, time demanding and expensive and even though they did not earn you anything up until recently (the Veteran of the Shifting Sands FoS) you would just feel great after completing the final step. There was a lot of lore, very exciting lore, and there was humor. Today I find that most jokes in quests are reallly not that funny. Kinda cheap. You laugh a little because you know it's supposed to be a funny line, but that's it. It's no where near the jokes in the quests involving Narain Soothfancy as an example. The fat has really been trimmed from this game. You can't even experience an entire zone to its fullest before you have to advance to another. There are no group quests for low levels despite the fact that low level characters are immensely powerful compared to how they were years ago. Even though the game was more difficult once, that didn't seem to stop the customer base to grow massively over the years? Today I see players burn out, and of course I don't see everything. But I am losing interest even though I feel there is so much more to experience in the game to come. When the end game is not more interesting than it is, I don't think it's affordable to make the content before end game so simple.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard is gonna take it down the road where everything comes in an easy-to-go package, I'm taking another road. Enough is enough. <br />
<br />
I know this will get a lot of replies like &quot;We don't care, go play something else&quot;. Don't bother. I know you're out there. I know game masters don't read this forum. I know a lot of people disagree, and you're free to do so. But this is how I feel. And I know others do too.<br />

<br />
<br />
And Blizzard is the one telling the story... and they decided the troll story wasn´t over like you thought it was. Naxx was rehashed content. Onyxia was rehashed content. ZA and ZG are continuing the troll story<br />
<br />
And yes, the bear is the bronze drake. No, it will not be trivial... right up until 4.2 launches. Once 4.2 launches, people will be buying 359s with JP and 372s with VP. That is when it will be trivial like the bronze drake was at the end of wotlk.</div></div><hr />

Well, before the bronze drake you got the original bear from the raid instance in the same manner. It was the bronze drake that ripped off the original bear aquiring technique. :P</div></div><hr />
