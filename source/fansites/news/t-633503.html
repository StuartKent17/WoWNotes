Arena Matchmaking System FAQ (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/14910422788-arena-matchmaking-system-faq.html)<br />
<br />
We are planning a lot of exciting content for patch 3.1.0, and we are doing a three-part preview series on upcoming class changes. This is the third in the series: Mages, Paladins, Hunters, and Death Knights. Please keep in mind, that this list is not at all comprehensive, and subject to change.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=670) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?mage))<br />
Improved Water Elemental – this talent has been removed and replaced with a new talent that grants Replenishment (similar to Shadow priests).<br />
We are also working on a way to give frost mages Ice Lance “Shatter combos” in PvE.<br />
We are also working on more survivability for Fire spec in PvP.<br />
We are also working on making Spirit a more useful and interesting stat for all mages.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=610) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Blessing of Kings – this spell is now a base ability trainable by all paladins.<br />
Exorcism – this spell now causes damage to all types of enemy targets. However, it always critical strikes undead or demon targets. This change should make sure paladin damage doesn’t drop when going from Naxxramas to later tiers of content.<br />
Shield of the Templar now causes your Avenger’s Shield and Shield of the Righteousness to silence targets for 3 sec. The old damage bonus of this talent has been folded into Holy Shield, Avenger’s Shield, and Shield of the Righteousness.<br />
Ardent Defender, Improved Hammer of Justice, One-Handed Weapon Specialization and more have had their ranks reduced.<br />
Guarded by the Light – no longer reduces the mana cost of shield spells, but now has a 50/100% chance to refresh Divine Plea duration.<br />
Judgements of the Just – now also reduces the cooldown of Hammer of Justice by 10/20 seconds and increases the duration of the Seal of Justice stun effect by 0.5/1 second.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=620) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />
Consumable ammunition has been removed from the game. Arrows and bullets no longer stack, but are not consumed. Ranged attack speed bonus gained from quivers and ammo bags will be preserved in a different capacity.<br />
A new tier of hunter pet talents have been added. In particular, this allows Beastmaster hunters to improve their damage per second (DPS) with their 51 point talent.<br />
Hunting Party – this talent has been reduced to 3 ranks and also grants a passive bonus to the hunter.<br />
Piercing Shots – this talent has been changed. Your Aimed, Steady and Chimera Shots cause the target to bleed for 10/20/30% of damage dealt for 8 sec.<br />
Sniper Training – this talent has been changed. After standing still for 6 sec, you gain a 2/4/6% damage bonus to Steady, Aimed and Explosive Shot.<br />
We are also looking to add additional trap functionality to Survival.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=650) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Gargoyle and Unholy Blight have swapped talent positions. Gargoyle’s damage has increased and runic power cost per time has decreased.<br />
Pestilence – this spell no longer causes damage but just spreads diseases. Blood Boil is intended to be the general area attack, and has been changed to be castable on targets with no diseases on them, but does extra damage if diseases are present.<br />
Unbreakable Armor now absorbs a flat amount of damage that increases as your armor increases. It no longer boosts armor.<br />
The Frost tree has been shuffled. Among other things, PvP talents such as Endless Winter are closer to the top of the tree where Blood and Unholy death knights can access them.<br />
Sudden Doom – this talent now procs a Death Coil rather than requiring an additional button click. It works similarly to shamans’ Lightning Overload.<br />
Magic Suppression and Blood of the North have been reduced to 3 ranks for the same benefit.<br />
Blood Gorged now grants armor penetration instead of expertise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Holy shit?<br />
<br />
I don't understand kings. I guess it just annoyed them too much they are just giving it to everyone. Everyone wanted it anyway.<br />
<br />
Exorcism on everything? Does that mean a powerfull ranged attack for PvP? I don't think non-pally will enjoy this.</div></div><hr />

Against undead in Naxx in order to stay competitive with other dps classes a Ret pally has to work both exorcism and holy wrath into a rotation that already includes divine storm and constant consecration(these 2 abilities were claimed at one point to hopefully be non necessary for general purpose raid dps for Ret). Blizz's efforts to thwart paladin burst in pvp has severely hampered a class who's pve dps is based on that same burst.<br />
<br />
I have often wondered if maybe some kind of dmg cap per ability given certain variables might be a decent fix for pvp issues...having been hit with a 10k starfire in my foray's into the arena I have to say my burst feels almost negligible</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe they're fixing paladin judgments so they don't get double bonus from crit rating, could be the reason they're giving paladins the ability to exorcism all types.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ARE YOU A NON-PALLY?<br />
<br />
ANSWER: I believe so :P<br />
<br />
As a Ret Pally, i'm happy about both the baseline Blessing of Kings, and the Exorcism change. Not sure if Exorcism on all types of creatures was the right change, but more than Undead/Demon is definitely correct. Not sure how the talented BoK will function now that the base version is a skill instead of a talent. Will it still be a 4-point talent in Prot tree?</div></div><hr />

Goodbye full unholy as the best AoE tanking spec, im sure another combo will be best now. Whatever it works out as, any spec DK is now god at AoE tanking, <br />
<br />
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br />
<br />
<br />
You do know that unholy blight is not the only reason Unholy is best on AOE threat right?<br />
But it sure will help blood in the aoe department.<br />
But if im not mistaken it also means a blood tank cant go more then 45p into the blood tree to be able to affor more armor from frost and UB from unholy and that will make then loose the 10% more dmg buff in the blood tree.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm looking forward on seeing the new gargoyle numbers :D<br />
To bad pestilence damage was removed :( I never used bloodboil becuase pestilence did more dmg and my bloodboil keybind was in a ackward place :P</div></div><hr />

NO NERF :(<br />
<br />
I want something that can actually interupt spell casting in a good way... seriously, that little thing alone would make PvP (im not talking about Arena) so much more appealing now as Ret.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure how the talented BoK will function now that the base version is a skill instead of a talent. Will it still be a 4-point talent in Prot tree?<br />
<br />
<br />
Would sound counter intuitive to the change... BoK at 2% is weak as hell compared to 10%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BoSanc is a whole nother story. Unless they plan to change it entirely/remove it.<br />
The Warrior changes might hint to something like that:<br />
<br />
<br />
* We are also looking at granting rage when the warrior blocks, dodges or parries.<br />
<br />
But as said, this is far from a complete list of changes. So keeping my fingers crossed. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hell Prot pally pvp. <br />
<br />
<br />
That's probs wrong, as they're taking ranks out of im HoJ, but the thing prot gains in PvP is a 3s silence on a 6s CD, and another 3s silence on a 30s CD, both of which do good damage (~4k crit on the first, ~6k crit on the second in pretty standard tank gear). I smell a nerfbat incoming on that!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't actually specify that it can't crit on non-undead. It only says that it will always crit on undead. Not that this really bothers me as I'm a pally anyway, and this will make my guild a little more welcoming of my idea to respec to shockadin for pve dps (just curious so far)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check all the class changes and you will notice that there are a handful of similarities already. They weren't fake. And chances are whatever you don't see after Blizzard posts a comprehensive list of changes were likely stuff that got scrapped after they drafted what was leaked.<br />
<br />
The main comparison will be the Ruby Dragonflight thing, though. If they announce that, Boub will have to eat his words...again.</div></div><hr />

I mean hell, now over half the classes in the game all are going to have the same buffs. It was bad enough when 2-3 had the exact same buff but now it's just ridiculous. <br />
<br />
One of the main benefits of bringing a ret pally or spriest was replenishment, but now with survival being a viable spec, and with locks and mages getting the same ability, what point is there in bringing either of those classes anymore? Good damage, but damage that is still inferior to a mage or lock? I am guessing hybrids will get a slight DPS boost to compensate for losing their semi-unique talents, but even still. It makes the game even more bland and unappealing when so many classes share the same abilities and effects.<br />
<br />
Not only that, I thought Ulduar was suppose to be significantly harder..? Yet every class is getting some substantial buffs? The only thing being nerfed at all is mana regen. Are they just showing us all the buffs to please players, but holding back all the nerfs incoming? I am so confused.<br />
<br />
I hear how Blizzard thinks the game is too easy right now, but it was intentional and Ulduar will kick it up a notch. Then they release all these class previews, which I realize aren't a full list of changes, but still it is nothing but buffs after buff to class. Either more damage, more streamlined abilities, or more usefullness for a class.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but do you realize that these are nothing but changes they plan on doing? Nothing says that they tested these or thought about them enough.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dokoran</div><div class="date">2009-02-06, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a horde Ret since BC release with my interest in the game being mostly PVE related, I have to say there is no way a change to exorcism is going to solve the problem. Against undead in Naxx in order to stay competitive with other dps classes a Ret pally has to work both exorcism and holy wrath into a rotation that already includes divine storm and constant consecration(these 2 abilities were claimed at one point to hopefully be non necessary for general purpose raid dps for Ret). Blizz's efforts to thwart paladin burst in pvp has severely hampered a class who's pve dps is based on that same burst.<br />
<br />
I have often wondered if maybe some kind of dmg cap per ability given certain variables might be a decent fix for pvp issues...having been hit with a 10k starfire in my foray's into the arena I have to say my burst feels almost negligible<br />
<br />
<br />
I've crit for 10k with my judgements in 2v2's. So...yeah, I disagree.<br />
<br />
The buff to exorcism will help, keep in mind, we're a hybrid class and I'm able to keep up with all the hybrid classes with the exception of shadow priests who seem to outdps me by 300-500 in pve.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, mages just got some buffs recently and quite frankly, need very little tweaking.<br />

My concern is PvP. <br />
<br />
Arcane's burst is going to be lowered next patch. I don't like the idea of rng bursting any class down in 3 globals, but something has to give as mages are still the only class without a heal or a healing debuff.</div></div><hr />

The kings talents in prot would have to be replaced by something and that would have to mean that they are gonna implement a new 21 pointer in to prot too. (I'm hoping for a Diablo 2 pala charge :P)<br />

The divine plea change in Prot is kinda good and bad because now I have to manage that too aside from doing everything else perfectly. But when being the offtank and trying to dps without getting any heals im going OOM in like 1 min. So now I might be able to keep up with the MT dps.<br />

That's just the way some people think. To them &quot;no buff to my spec in this patch&quot; = nerf. This attitude is partly responsible for the trend towards &quot;making the game easier&quot;, as thousands of players are constantly informing us (please stop).<br />

With 3.1 we get <br />

- 3s silence on 8s CD (Shield of R)<br />
- 3s ranged silence on 30s CD (Avenger Shield)<br />

<br />
:o 8) ??? :o 8) ??? :o 8) ???<br />

This can't be right... in PVP this means: Avengers Shield(3s), Stun(6s), Shield(3s), Stun(6s), Exorcism(2s), Shield(3s), Stun(6s)<br />

Nice! But from a Ret's perspective: Where are we suppossed to put points into now?<br />
<br />
<br />
Exorcism – this spell now causes damage to all types of enemy targets. However, it always critical strikes undead or demon targets. This change should make sure paladin damage doesn’t drop when going from Naxxramas to later tiers of content.<br />
<br />
That's their fix for the upcoming Ulduar problem? Really? We lose a 1% Dmg modifier from the Sense Undead Glyph and another 3% from Crusade. So we finally get another allround damage attack, but how should this be able to compensate for 1.01*1.03 modifier? Exorcism isn't suppossed to be part of our rotation if we don't want to run out of mana. If we have to use Exorcism now, we'll going oom really soon, especially with the Spiritual Attument nerf incoming.<br />
The only thing this change will cause is people QQing about Palas in Arenas.<br />
<br />
About the Prot changes:<br />
<br />
Lol, they were really serious about making Tank specs viable in PvP.</div></div><hr />

With 3.1 we get <br />
- infinite mana (If I understand right DP auto-refresh after getting any dmg)<br />
- 6s stun on 10s CD (60s -imp HoJ[30] -JotJ[20] = 10s)<br />
- 3s silence on 8s CD (Shield of R)<br />
- 3s ranged silence on 30s CD (Avenger Shield)<br />
- 2s ranged silence on 15s CD (Glyphed Exorcism).<br />
<br />
:o 8) ??? :o 8) ??? :o 8) ???<br />
<br />
This can't be right... in PVP this means: Avengers Shield(3s), Stun(6s), Shield(3s), Stun(6s), Exorcism(2s), Shield(3s), Stun(6s)<br />
<br />
Ok I neglected the diminishing returns... but isn't this totally op? So many counters to spells is insane. Even the 10s CD on 6s stun alone is totally insane. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think anyone with a reasonable mind knows all of the above changes ain't gonna happen. That would be just be overboared, at a level which hasn't seen before in WoW.<br />
<br />
The exorcism is likely to be changed too down the line IF they do not introduce several nerfs for ret in pvp. Cause we all know how ret is now, imagine them using exorcism too with an interupt on it...<br />
<br />
So for me, either they just showed all the buffs for now and the nerfs might make the above more reasonable or there won't be so many nerfs and the above buffs get changed deleted.<br />
<br />
<br />
And tbh, Blizzard is quite lazy imo when it comes to class fixes:<br />
problems in pvp: give mortal whatever skill<br />
problems in pve: give em replenishment...</div></div><hr />

Actually, i dont see any boost/buffs there, they just want to buff frost in PvE a little, but that replenishment really doesnt help. Also, Icelance compared to the improved FB with all talents is a waste of gcd. <br />
I think mages are fine now, and frost should be played for pvp, who cares about additional replenishment, there are no problems with mana regeneration in 25 raids<br />

You have no idea what you're talking about. HoJ won't be on a 10s CD.... Imp HoJ is going down to 10s. So Ret pallies have a 50s CD HoJ and Prot pallies keep their 30s CD HoJ. If you really think Prot pallies could be competitive in Arena, you're wrong.<br />
<br />
It's just a flat nerf for Ret, the goal is not to make Prot OP in arena.<br />
<br />
About the DP change, it's a good thing. When you overgear a raid and the trash gets destroyed by the DPS, you really have to spend a lot of mana to keep up with the TPS. And in the meantime you don't get a lot of mana from BoS because evrything dies so fast. So yeah, Prot pallies can be in trouble sometimes. And since we are the only tank with limited &quot;energy&quot;, Blizz gives us a lot of tool to make mana a non issue.</div></div><hr />

While you are right that ret pallies most likely no longer will enjoy 30 sec HoJ, getting a spell interrupt is nothing but a buff to ret. It is, in fact, the last piece of the puzzle for retribution. Now we just need SS to scale with the spell power gained with SoL.<br />
<br />
And I bet you prot pvp WILL be decent. The flaws are being addressed, loads of spell interrupts and mana shouldn't be a problem unless fighting dispellers. But even so, you can quite happily dodge dispells with some sneaky moves.<br />
<br />
And let's all not forget that the exorcism change is like... zomgodz, bringing back the shockadin... kind of. yay!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other changes are nice as well especially allowing Avenger's Shield and SoR to silence. Add in the glyph of exorcism which will now work on all targets and that is 3 3 second spell interrupts for protection in a 10 second period. That means that protection can steam roll casters and healers and not even think twice about it in pvp. Its also funny as hell that at a point where they are talking about eliminating random proc stuns they improve seal of justice.<br />
<br />
Make no doubt about it, if these changes go live, any protection paladin and most retribution paladins won't even need burst damage to destroy casters. It seems like paladins are a pet class of WoW this expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. I has been an money sink, bag stealing, annoyance for many years. Im an engineer, and the mats for the engineering arrows are 3g a stack on my server. the 24 slot quiver has never been big enough to carry an entire raid, but lets say to fill a bag for 1 raid would be 3x24= 72g for raiding only every day. Not to mention all the non raiding you would do would easily double this amount. So 150g on arrows a day rly hit ur cashflow if ur not into farming gold, and just want to play and keep ur gold at a balance.<br />
<br />
I remember from an earlier post these new arrow icons:<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/308ammoicons.jpg<br />
<br />
The arrow icons kinda look like they have an addition to them such as, frost, piercing, bleed effect, fire, armor reduce or poison.<br />
<br />
Hope this makes it to live servers, and would be nice if u have to think about wich arrows u woud use in wich situation.. im just dreaming :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deathleech</div><div class="date">2009-02-06, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hyrbids are doing just fine. If anything it's hybrids (except for hunters) that are doing the best in Arena at the moment. And have you been raiding for the last couple months? Hyrbids can top the charts, or come very close to doing so.<br />
<br />
<br />
First off I was referring strictly to PVE, I never commented on their status in PVP. Secondly hybrids are decent enough in PVE, but the only pure DPS they keep up with or pass atm are &quot;broken&quot; classes that are getting major PVE buffs (i.e. rogues). Look at some stats of top guilds and you will see the only hybrids regularly dominating are fury warriors who are getting/got nerfed, and death knights. Shadow priests also can do decent. Other than that it's all mages, hunters, and locks. Feral druids, boomkins, ele/enh shaman, and ret paladins are all hovering around the 10th place mark, give or take 3 slots. <br />
<br />
Now this would be fine if hybrids bring lots of utility, like they currently do. Howerver with the proposed changes much of hybrid utility will be lost. Ret paladins, for example, already share their +3% raid dmg talent with BM Hunters, their 3% crit one with rogues, and a number of other buffs with pure dps class and other hybrids. Now even MORE classes, specifically pure DPS classes, will bring the same buffs to the table as ret paladins. <br />
<br />
If there is a mage and a hunter who regularly top the damage meter, like they currently do, and they also bring the +3% dmg buff and replenishment that a paladin does.. then what's the point of bringing a ret pally who is 5+ on the damage meters anymore? Back up heals? Ya right. It's back to TBC times. The only difference is now a ret pally brings no utility you can't get from other pure dps classes. To make up for it they do slightly more damage, but it's still not as good as a pure DPS class. If they bring no new utlity buffs and do more dmg, but still inferior to a pure DPS class then guess what? They are not needed anymore.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-02-06, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exorcism on everything? Does that mean a powerfull ranged attack for PvP? I don't think non-pally will enjoy this.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say powerful. Its not that powerful. It is a decent ranged attack for pvp that also silences the target for 3 seconds though. Protection paladins will have 2 ranged and 1 melee silence. Other paladins will have 1 silence depending on glyphs.</div></div><hr />

Every spec except holy is getting buffed, which is getting nerfed. How exactly does this lower the burst damage in PvP and make heals more useful? I understand the game is PvE orientated but comeon &gt;.&gt; Non-talent kings is nice though.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Anyone else think Prot might be a viable PvP spec now? It'll be for those outlasting teams obviously.<br />
<br />
<br />
Protection will eat casters with these changes (including healers). As it stands they will have more silences than a dk. They already can crit two abilities for 8k+ with proper buffs/glyphs so that is 16k damage right there. Resilience will help to tide that but a protection paladin with lucky crits should be able to down someone in pvp within 3-4 hits easily and the changes to other classes with ignore armor capabilities will mean that melee will have major issues killing protection paladins and the 3 silences will mean casters will have issues killing them as well. They aren't really kitable easily because of hand of freedom and they have 15% speed increase if talented for it. I would say that protection paladins are definitely viable in pvp after these changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
why does everyone think Shadowpriests are doing decent?, they only get up there on fights where their dots give an advantage or in aoe fights, the rest of the time you won't see a shadowpriest in the top 13th, if you do then the rest of the dps are just not doing their job right, a ret pally who's usually 5+ on the meters has a bigger chance of being taken to a raid than a priest who is 10+</div></div><hr />

Omg, I'm so making a hunter in 3.1. This is possibly the best change for the class since it became a class. It will be interesting to see how they compensate for both quiver/pouch haste and ammo damage though.

Except that most people don't get the 51p talent in unholy for PvP as it gimps your survivabilty a lot. Ah well, personally I don't care becasue now I can get UHB with the good old 21/0/50 build for PvP. The gargoyle was always a nice addition in PvP but not essential.</div></div><hr />

They were fake. This change has been hinted at by Blizzard so many times that my cat could have figured out it was going to happen. The same with the baseline kings.

<br />
<br />
They aren't going to just leave a hole where kings is now. We will be getting a new 5 point talent. Hopefully it will have to do with either increased stamina or maybe baseline defense (we should be so lucky) since gear wise paladins are currently not scaling as well as any of the tanks. The other points will be slimmed but it will make a lot of those talents that didn't look all that great for the points become worth taking. Hell, they even buffed the majority of the abilities that didn't look all that great.</div></div><hr />

I am both an engineer and miner, so the cost of creating a crate of ammo is just a little bit of my time. However, I learned long ago that using the top ammo/arrow is silly and I always go one rank down (and with exalted rep in Dalaran, my cost is 24s a stack), I use a 28 slot ammo bag, so .24 x 28 = 6.72g<br />
<br />
This idea though is very similar to something I proposed once. Basically Ammo/Arrows becomes the Hunters version of Idols (etc.), and certain bosses in raids or with enough rep with certain factions, give you an upgraded version of ammo/arrows to use. So while the engineered versions are great to use starting into Naxx, you eventually get something better to boost your dmg by +30 or something like that.<br />
<br />
However, to the point, if you're spending 150g a day on arrows, you should seriously reconsider which ones you're buying right now for your day to day activities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im not a miner indeed. And ofc im not spending 150g a day on arrows, cause i dont use the engineering arrows for raids (but i bet alot of hardcore raiding hunters in top guilds do). The costs for the mats are 3g per stack. I could never have made a profit out of selling these arrows, since no casual hunter would spend 3g + some creation fee on 1 stack of arrows.<br />
<br />
However, i did use these arrows for Arena, and since arena doesnt give any gold its still an unfortunate expense, and im glad it gets rid of. I hope the new arrow types wont be to expensive, or hard to obtain. I rather not be chasing down raid bosses for an &quot;arrow item&quot; to drop, or to see the best arrows drop at places ill never be able to reach.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
btw always found it lame that the best arrows costs so much, so most hunter wouldnt use em for raids and day to day stuff. Id always like to reach the maximum potential the hunter class had to offer, and arrows are as much a part of that as anything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Here I was thinking one of the reasons to bring a shadow priest was for vampiric embrace healing. Also, if you assume that 15 people in your raid have mana bars you will need 3 players with replenishment. Shadow priests and Retribution Paladins are more played than survival hunters, frost mages, and destruction warlocks. The three specs of dps that actually have replenishment are the lowest damage specs of that class in 3.1. Also, it would be an absolute douche guild to not bring friends with them that have raided for all this content just because of these changes. Also hybrids will be playing 2 roles in raids now with duel speccing. That makes them highly valued. I personally plan on duel speccing my priest to shadow and discipline.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hear how Blizzard thinks the game is too easy right now, but it was intentional and Ulduar will kick it up a notch. Then they release all these class previews, which I realize aren't a full list of changes, but still it is nothing but buffs after buff to class. Either more damage, more streamlined abilities, or more usefullness for a class. <br />
<br />
<br />
They always roll out the buffs first. Although, it doesn't seem like 3.1 will have a heavy nerf bat approach. It seems they are buffing all the classes to bring them more in line with each other instead of just nerfing the classes that might be a little overpowered. Also, as I have been saying for a long time, Uludar won't be as hard as you think it is going to be. It will be harder than Naxx but probably about the same difficulty as ZA (pre-nerfs) as compared to Karazhan. Classes were entering ZA and clearing it with dungeon blues even before the nerfs if they min/maxxed correctly). There is a reason Uludar has a hard mode for all bosses, and that reason is its not as hard as hardcores want it to be but it is harder than Naxx. Perhaps you will have to stay out of fires and dps at the same time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So true. Thats why they balanced arena so anyone in PvE gear can do well there and you don't even have to compete with people of better skill to get points. This argument is DEAD. This whole expansion has been about making arenas the next place to farm just like they did with BGs. They will probably still have hardcore matches for arena, but I don't think the focus is on arena anymore. They are even releasing new pve gear every expansion to coincide with the better arena gear every season which didn't happen in TBC (which is why people went arena crazy for the gear that let them pown content in both pvp and pve and was truly the best gear in the game for the class).</div></div><hr />

They never really said that the classes were overpowered. They said that players thought they were. From the changes to all classes it is looking much more like they decided to buff pvp survivability instead of nerfing the damage that some classes do.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liquid_Beaver</div><div class="date">2009-02-06, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Prot Paladin, I have a few things to say about the changes.<br />
<br />
First of all, I love all the new silences, however, I think that ShotR silencing is a little overboard. Just with Avenger's Shield (Which should be in every Protadins rotation now), Exorcism glyph (likely to be changed), and Hammer of Justice, we would have plenty of silences to be considered fair (relative to other tanks and their PvPability). Rolling more base damage into the tanking rotation spells and abilities will also be great for undergeared tanks, as their threat will go up.<br />
<br />
There are two things that making BoK trainable will do. First of all, it will make Tier 1 of Prot have just one talent, unless as someone brought up earlier, they make BoK trainable, and still have Imp BoK in the Prot Tree, which defeats the purpose of making it trainable in my opinion. Also, they still have no released any plans or considerations for the 11-point talent in the Prot tree, which is still the ONLY tree in the game with no 11-point talent.<br />
<br />
The changes to Ardent Defender, 1Handed Spec., and Imp HoJ are a godsend. The prot tree is INCREDIBLY bloated as of right now. It would be very nice to see if the changes would allow Prot Pallies to get to interesting abilities in other trees, such as Eye for an Eye for PvPing, or Improved Lay on Hands, just in time to try out all this new, more difficult content.<br />
<br />
The Guarded by the Light change is purely for PvP and Soloing, but that is fairly obvious. I will still take this talent, especially if I have extra points with the point reductions of the other talents.<br />
<br />
Judgements of the Just - This change is also amazing, I would love to be able to have so many silences and interupts that I can rely on myself for it during boss encounters, but I wonder if this will bring unnecessary ridicule on the tank if those spells do go uninterupted, and a wipe results.</div></div><hr />

Protection paladins aren't like warriors. They are like super warriors. Warriors have to work as it is to keep up with paladins in single target threat and aoe threat. The trade off is that warriors get more survivability.</div></div><hr />

Spiritual Focus and Healing Light for 8/5/58 spec. Its actually a very nice usage of points for both soloing and grouping. Its the only spec I have ever been willing to use when I play ret.

<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow, so basically what I am reading with all these changes is they are getting rid of all classes, except three: tanks, healers, and DPS. I mean hell, now over half the classes in the game all are going to have the same buffs. It was bad enough when 2-3 had the exact same buff but now it's just ridiculous. <br />
<br />
One of the main benefits of bringing a ret pally or spriest was replenishment, but now with survival being a viable spec, and with locks and mages getting the same ability, what point is there in bringing either of those classes anymore? Good damage, but damage that is still inferior to a mage or lock? I am guessing hybrids will get a slight DPS boost to compensate for losing their semi-unique talents, but even still. It makes the game even more bland and unappealing when so many classes share the same abilities and effects.<br />
<br />
Not only that, I thought Ulduar was suppose to be significantly harder..? Yet every class is getting some substantial buffs? The only thing being nerfed at all is mana regen. Are they just showing us all the buffs to please players, but holding back all the nerfs incoming? I am so confused.<br />
<br />
I hear how Blizzard thinks the game is too easy right now, but it was intentional and Ulduar will kick it up a notch. Then they release all these class previews, which I realize aren't a full list of changes, but still it is nothing but buffs after buff to class.

If they bring no new utlity buffs and do more dmg, but still inferior to a pure DPS class then guess what? They are not needed anymore. <br />

<br />
I don't know about you but having an additional paladin blessing seems alright to me. Having an extra aura seems alright to me. The average raid has one protection and one holy paladin. You gain more by adding an additional ret than you lose. Also, guilds recruit hybrids because they want them to play as HYBRIDS. That means when they need an extra healer they want that retribution to go respec (which they can do instantly in a raid if duel speccing works correctly) and play as a healer. The beauty of playing a hybrid is that you can play 3 VIABLE play styles. I personally plan on having one holy spec and one protection spec for my tanking paladin. If you rolled a paladin just because you wanted to play a melee dps 100% of the time you should have rolled a rogue instead by Blizzard's logic.</div></div><hr />

Dots give an advantage in just about all fights. There are plenty of aoe fights. Blizzard wants different classes to top the charts on different encounters.<br />

<br />
the rest of the time you won't see a shadowpriest in the top 13th, if you do then the rest of the dps are just not doing their job right, a ret pally who's usually 5+ on the meters has a bigger chance of being taken to a raid than a priest who is 10+<br />

I look to see the ammo be obtainable in the same ways it is now. Probably from rep vendors, engineering, and regular vendors. The difference is that you will only buy one from each of those places and that will be what you use till you get something better. I really hope that these items become hybrid (counts as ammo/arrow) and then engineering ammo could be the best to use while leveling and possibly still the best at end game until you start raiding and then I really do think ammo dropping from high end raid bosses and being obtainable through pvp and badges (about the same cost as other relics) would be awesome.</div></div><hr />

Vampriric embrace is definitely a reason to bring spriest, but replenishment is just as big of one. As for ret pallies and spriest being more played.. um, no? Have you not noticed ALL the hunters going survival after the recent BM nerf? Sure there is still a BM or MM hunter here and there, but it's rare. Most are survival atm. <br />
<br />
As for the three new pure DPS classes getting replenishment being the lowest DPS specs.. you have NO idea if that is true or not, you are just guessing based on what little info we have available and how they currently perform. As I said survival is now the most played hunter spec so who knows how it will be in 3.1. I do agree with your last comment, but hey, some guilds are hardcore and will try to clear content at any cost.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">delage35</div><div class="date">2009-02-06, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I suspected from your earlier post, you are fixated on DPS as main criteria for a raid encounter. Looking at current content, its easy to understand why you would be. That doesnt mean the encounters will remain DPS dependent (beyond some minimum comfortable level that all dps classes in decent gear should be able achieve). When that happens, recount data becomes interesting but not an indicator of raid capability beyond that level. The blue posts keep saying this, but apparently it hasnt sunk in yet. I don't think its beyond the designers capabilities to build encounters where class dps isnt an issue. Heroic Oculus is already a primitive example where it doesnt matter who you have for the last boss... they either know how to do the encounter and can execute or you all wipe. Scale the concept up to 25-man and give 15 or more of those players something unique to be done in a certain way or in a certain sequence with everyone else and watch tard dps'ers start to /cry. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First off I was referring strictly to PVE, I never commented on their status in PVP. Secondly hybrids are decent enough in PVE, but the only pure DPS they keep up with or pass atm are &quot;broken&quot; classes that are getting major PVE buffs (i.e. rogues). Look at some stats of top guilds and you will see the only hybrids regularly dominating are fury warriors who are getting/got nerfed, and death knights. Shadow priests also can do decent. Other than that it's all mages, hunters, and locks. Feral druids, boomkins, ele/enh shaman, and ret paladins are all hovering around the 10th place mark, give or take 3 slots. <br />
<br />
Now this would be fine if hybrids bring lots of utility, like they currently do. Howerver with the proposed changes much of hybrid utility will be lost. Ret paladins, for example, already share their +3% raid dmg talent with BM Hunters, their 3% crit one with rogues, and a number of other buffs with pure dps class and other hybrids. Now even MORE classes, specifically pure DPS classes, will bring the same buffs to the table as ret paladins. <br />
<br />
If there is a mage and a hunter who regularly top the damage meter, like they currently do, and they also bring the +3% dmg buff and replenishment that a paladin does.. then what's the point of bringing a ret pally who is 5+ on the damage meters anymore? Back up heals? Ya right. It's back to TBC times. The only difference is now a ret pally brings no utility you can't get from other pure dps classes. To make up for it they do slightly more damage, but it's still not as good as a pure DPS class. If they bring no new utlity buffs and do more dmg, but still inferior to a pure DPS class then guess what? They are not needed anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh I'm not missing the point at all. My worry is if hybrids are only slightly lower DPS, but ARE regularly lower on the meters, what reason is there to bring them? If a raid leader has to decide between a mage and spriest, with the mage putting out 300 more DPS than a spriest and both have replenishment now, the choice to pick the mage is gonna be extremely easy. Before the spriest could get away with doing slightly lower DPS because of the utility, but not so anymore. If a mage has all the buffs a spriest brings, then a spriest should bring all the DPS a mage does. <br />
<br />
I think you are in fact the one missing the point. Sure you might have a raid spot regardless of your class/spec if the guild needs you, but what about guilds where 3-4 people have to sit out a night? If it's a choice based strictly on who benefits the raid more, pure DPS classes will ALWAYS be taken simply because they do more DPS and offer the same buffs as hybrids. I mean hell, you are basically saying someone should take a hybrid &quot;just because&quot; despite them doing less DPS and despite them not bringing any extra buffs to the table. Sure you maybe can get a boss down with a mage OR a feral druid, but why not make it easier and take the mage who puts out more DPS, even if it is a few hundred more is all.</div></div><hr />

Sure on some of those fights you can't stand still the whole time, but you can easily more than 80% of the time. <br />
<br />
As for the arrow change I don't like it at all. I have a hunter alt and it just won't feel right having an unlimited amount of arrows and continually shooting them with only a single arrow equipped. Sure this game has magical talking dragons and crazy monsters running around, but c'mon. At least leave a BIT of of believability in there. If we are going to do away with stacks of arrows lets also just make all armor and weapons and everything else be stored in magical rifts we can reach into anytime we want and grab the gear we acquired. <br />
<br />
Not only that hunters have FD to lower their repair costs. They also have pets to take damage for them further reducing the durability damage they take. They have no reagents to buy and buff people with. Arrows were one of the main things they had to pay for and now they don't? If arrows were costing that much more than what other classes had to pay they could of easily lowered the arrow cost/mat cost. But just making it so you only buy one arrow is ridiculous. Give me a break.<br />
<br />
And like I said yes I realize arrows can be spendy, but I go through maybe a quiver full a day. 24-28 slot quivers are fairly easy to come buy and will easily last you an entire raid or day of doing dailys/PVP. Totally restocking my quiver costed roughly 20g at level 70 and that was with the very best stuff you could buy. If money is a problem down rank to the normal vendor arrows, save yourself several dozen gold, and do 10 less DPS. The difference is really negligible.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a hunter, but their ammo had a bigger impact than any other class on their inventory and was much more constantly required than others. In the end, you need it all the time, and as such it just gets in the way. A bit like weapon skills. Its a damn pointless annoyance in the end, and nothing else.</div></div><hr />

Easily fixable really. All they would of had to do is allow the quiver to be equipped in the ammo slot, thus still allowing you to have as many bag slots as anyone else for items. They also could of done away with quivers and ammo pouches totally and allowed arrows to just increase weapon speed themselves and stack 1000-2000 instead of 200.</div></div><hr />

Go blizzard!!!1<br />
<br />
<br />
The mages that are getting buffed are Frost mages for raid viability (hooray!), and Fire for PvP surivability. Nothing about Arcane mages, which garner most of the QQ nowadays.<br />
<br />
Not everyone rolls a flavor-of-the-month spec; I'm doing okay in 10-mans with very little T7 gear to date as a Frost Mage, but if Ulduar is going to require everyone to bring their A-game I'd like it if I wasn't forced to respec to Fire or Arcane to do so.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinamic</div><div class="date">2009-02-06, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off I was referring strictly to PVE, I never commented on their status in PVP. Secondly hybrids are decent enough in PVE, but the only pure DPS they keep up with or pass atm are &quot;broken&quot; classes that are getting major PVE buffs (i.e. rogues). Look at some stats of top guilds and you will see the only hybrids regularly dominating are fury warriors who are getting/got nerfed, and death knights. Shadow priests also can do decent. Other than that it's all mages, hunters, and locks. Feral druids, boomkins, ele/enh shaman, and ret paladins are all hovering around the 10th place mark, give or take 3 slots. <br />
<br />
Now this would be fine if hybrids bring lots of utility, like they currently do. Howerver with the proposed changes much of hybrid utility will be lost. Ret paladins, for example, already share their +3% raid dmg talent with BM Hunters, their 3% crit one with rogues, and a number of other buffs with pure dps class and other hybrids. Now even MORE classes, specifically pure DPS classes, will bring the same buffs to the table as ret paladins. <br />
<br />
If there is a mage and a hunter who regularly top the damage meter, like they currently do, and they also bring the +3% dmg buff and replenishment that a paladin does.. then what's the point of bringing a ret pally who is 5+ on the damage meters anymore? Back up heals? Ya right. It's back to TBC times. The only difference is now a ret pally brings no utility you can't get from other pure dps classes. To make up for it they do slightly more damage, but it's still not as good as a pure DPS class. If they bring no new utlity buffs and do more dmg, but still inferior to a pure DPS class then guess what? They are not needed anymore. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mage replenishment you're not getting unless you spec frost, which isn't a build outdpsing hybrids. Mage's 10% crit buff is also likely being nerfed. I disagree with your banishing of hybrids to 10th place on the meters, and so does Blizzard. It's an exaggeration on your part and simply not true. Patchwerk isn't the only boss in the game you know.</div></div><hr />

I assume that was intended as snark, but if not -- do you think being able to carry 16 polearms in a backpack is believable? Or 16 plate chestpieces? Isn't there a quest that requires you to carry a person's body back as an item in your bags? The believability ship sailed a while ago when it comes to items and bag space.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like the idea that it allows for more interesting or fun ammo types; the new icons for bullets and arrows that people have found implies that this is the direction they intend to go. Ammo for bow or gun users would now be similar to the different wands that cloth casters can use; I'm hoping that Engineers get some recipes for Incendiary Rounds that do fire damage or Storm Arrows that do electrical (nature) damage.</div></div><hr />

And the whole thing about wasting gold for raids on arrows/bullets. I was blessed enough to get a Thori'dal before the expansion and man o man is it freaking awesome. Now that content has been nerfed to the ground, I suggest you pick one up. I usually swap Thori'dal in for trash packs and use my gun on bosses.

Actually in Everquest, Rangers had an AA (alternate ability) called 'Endless Quiver'. This meant that they had an unlimited amount of whatever arrow was currently being used. AA's in EQ are sort of like Talents in WoW. Every Ranger spent the points to get Endless Quiver. Buying arrows has no affect whatsoever on someones play style...unless you are an RP'er on an RP server.<br />

What the **** is Blizzard thinking?<br />
Hunters is everything in the fucking game combined into 1 class..<br />
They got ranged damage. DoT's. Dispel. Manadrain. Imbah CC. (Wyvern Sting, Wing Clip, Concussive shot, Scatter shot, frost trap, and freezing trap, which they plan to buff even more) Then they also have the pet in the game doing most damage (which they also plan to buff &quot;A new tier of hunter pet talents have been added. In particular, this allows Beastmaster hunters to improve their damage per second (DPS) with their 51 point talent.&quot;)<br />
The BM-tree also offer CC-immunity.<br />
Then they also have a 10 yard backward leap to get even more range, and that deflect-thingie.<br />

<br />
Well no, of course it's not believable, just like magical talking dragons aren't. However it's not quite as bad as arrows just popping out of thin air and an endless supply of arrows at that. It's like older FPS games, sure you had 12 guns on you which was totally asinine, but you at least had to have ammo for those guns to shoot em, you didn't just have all these guns, and then on top of it endless supplies of ammo magically appearing. <br />
<br />
Regardless of the whole believability or not debate, it just seems stupid in my honest opinion. I have played a hunter for a few years now, I know what it's like and the hassle that comes with having to buy and maintain arrows. However, this seems like yet another way Blizzard is dumbing down the game and making it even easier. Tanking and healing is at an all time low, you are able to build incredible threat by only hitting a few buttons and healers never go below 75% mana. DPS classes are easily putting out 4k+ DPS. What's next?<br />
<br />
Lets take away hunter ammo since it's a bit of a hassle. Lets also take away lock soul shards. Hell, while we are at it lets also take away all reagents being needed to cast buffs. Lets also do away with mounts and traveling, lets just make you able to instantly teleport anywhere you wanna go since traveling can be a pain. And hey, why even have repairs either? Just make the gold get auto deducted each time you wipe or hell, lets not even have armor take durability losses at all! Its annoying and it's not REALLY needed in the game. The time wasted from wipes should be enough of a downer, amirite? <br />
<br />
See where I am going with this? It's not just the hunter ammo change, but many of the announced ones. Everything was incredibly easy when WotLK shipped, much more so than in vanilla WoW or even BC. These new intended changes though are just ridiculous. Not only are they making several classes incredibly similair with their buffs and utility, they are also taking out even more things in the game to dumb it down and make it a total joke.</div></div><hr />

Its been theorized that they may be dropping scorch down to 5% crit instead of 10 based on what the warlock change said.<br />

<br />
<br />
Well, in Bc it was much more about PvP balance than u think (at least most patches was about PvP balance as far as i remember). Though in Classic WoW, was mostly about PvE (though the best gear was only obtainable trough PvE).<br />
<br />
The game should be designed for both. U miss the point that there is ppl that like both PvP and PvE. And u shouldn't just seek for &quot;Give me what i need, and i don't care about what the rest want&quot;, but think about what entire WoW community want.<br />
Some ppl like only PvE, some ppl like only PvP, and some like both. Even those that like both prefer 1 of those, and that's ok.<br />
So just bcos u like only one of those, or u prefer one of those, it doesn't mean that it should be designed just for u. If some ppl prefer other aspects of game, let them enjoy they game, and u enjoy what it is given to u.<br />
As for me i like both aspects of game (even i though i prefer PvP). And i dont think they should give best gear trough only one type of the game, (atm it is PvE only for weapons, and it was so far either for weapon or for full gear, as it was in Classic WoW). PvP should get all best PvP items trough PvP, and PvE should get best PvE items trough PvE. Well players may combine those items if they prefer to, but let them not be dependent on aspect of game they don't like.<br />
Blizzard made pretty good job so far, but is far from perfect. Still PvP-ers have to raid to get some of their best gear (for example weapons or trinkets), and that has to be fixed.<br />

If it's a choice based strictly on who benefits the raid more, pure DPS classes will ALWAYS be taken simply because they do more DPS and offer the same buffs as hybrids. I mean hell, you are basically saying someone should take a hybrid &quot;just because&quot; despite them doing less DPS and despite them not bringing any extra buffs to the table. Sure you maybe can get a boss down with a mage OR a feral druid, but why not make it easier and take the mage who puts out more DPS, even if it is a few hundred more is all.<br />
<br />
<br />
If they make the encounters harder in the sense of coordination mechanics instead of dps (this is their repeated message), a hybrid would ALWAYS have a raid spot over a pure class if they were better at paying attention, reacting dynamically in helpful ways, and executing a strategy. Thats the point, period. Being 400dps higher than someone else will mean nothing if you suck at encounter execution. In old world 40mans they pulled this off, but it was still class specific in the sense that certain encounters needed to have a minimum of class X with unique ability Y to succeed. As the abilities become less unique and dps less important to raid success, raiding guilds will be best served by finding good players to bring, not good classes.<br />
<br />
That doesnt mean some shitty guilds wont cling to your flawed logic and bring the highest dps they can find regardless of skill, but thats a different issue. Those guilds will find themselves stuck for inordinate lengths of time at bosses they just cant get past (go figure). Then the hate bashing will begin and the factions of the guild will splinter off.

You don't seem to be getting the point at all. Yes, of COURSE a hybrid who knows the fight and can execute what needs to be done will be chosen over a pure DPS class that can pump out 400 more DPS but likes to sit in a fissure and die. That's a no brainer. It's no different than say a warrior who has 4k more hp than a pally tank, but that warrior can't hold agro for crap and doesn't use any dmg mitigation moves during a fight. The warrior/pure DPS class, despite having more potential, is hinder by their own skill thus making them the worse choice. I am not arguing with you AT ALL about this, and thus this is not my concern either. It's common sense who to bring in that situation. <br />
<br />
My concern is with two equally geared/skilled players, both more than capable of executing a strategy. If say a mage and spriest both can execute a strategy without messing up, both bring the same buffs, but the mage also pumps out 400 more DPS simply because of their class, why would you take the spriest over the mage ever? You wouldn't. Before hybrids could bring very useful buffs, but with the recent announcements that's no longer the case.<br />
<br />
Oh, and in regards to your last paragraph... you do realize through all of vanilla WoW and TBC the best guilds WOULD stack their ranks with the very most useful classes. In fact go read up on Nihilium's killing of several diffierent bosses, they would ONLY bring X class to get the job done because they were the best. Of course they had the most skilled players for X class, but they also only would bring certain classes to get the job done cause they made it the easiest and were the best candidates. Now I am not saying Ulduar will be so difficult you NEED that extra 400 dps a mage brings over an spriest, but if you had to choose wouldn't you wanna make it as easy as possible? I know I would.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To do what, clear trash faster? Buy 4 more seconds on a 10min encounter when your group is already well ahead of meeting all damage/time requirements? Yeah 4 seconds, maybe less depending on what the average dps is with the mage and what the average is with the spriest. Bottomline, a 400dps difference results in a trivial difference that will be completely drowned by the other random factors in an encounter that is execution-heavy.<br />
<br />
Your position is definitely entrenched in the last 5 years of design and guild approach, but the developers keeps saying that the design is moving away from that. If guilds don't, so be it. Find a better guild.</div></div><hr />

They're not giving Mage's more mana regen. Water elemental was already a huge mana return for the raid, this is actually a nerf since it won't stack with other classes' replentishments now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pestilence – this spell no longer causes damage but just spreads diseases. Blood Boil is intended to be the general area attack, and has been changed to be castable on targets with no diseases on them, but does extra damage if diseases are present.<br />
<br />
As a death knight without Howling Blast, this was kind of a way to keep aoe aggro. DnD, IT, PS, Pestilence.<br />
Now I have to wait for the blood rune to refresh to use the retarded Blood Boil to keep aggro. What's wrong with Pestilence as it is now? I for one have never fought that many and that long that Pestilence was in anyways useful or overpowered in PvP. And if you for some reason would find yourself in the position of fighting multiple people at once, I highly doubt Pestilence with damage like it is now will make it or brake it. To me it's just a silly change and a change that contridicts Blizzards philosophy with letting the players decide between multiple routes to the same goal. With this change, all you do is forcing people to take Howling Blast for aoe tanking threat.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it is a bit of a silly change. As you stated, it's not as if Pestilence is a major nuke or anything. I use it primarily to spread Frost Fever, but the little extra DPS is nice (I'm a Frostie, not Unholy). I always thought of Blood Boil to be more of a Conflagrate type spell. It puts out good damage, but consumes a DoT. I wasn't aware that anybody was calling for Pestilence to be nerfed?! Sounds like someone at Blizzard HQ is bored or wants to do some busywork.<br />
<br />
I've always liked Howling Blast for threat anyways, because it's front-loaded. I'm sure sooner or later they'll nerf HB.</div></div><hr />

After the regen changes it kinda becomes mandatory (or at least, if you dont outgear ulduar or any other upcoming content), so i guess they want more classes to bring it.<br />
It does warrant a buff to for example shadowpriests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you actually play a mage to know that there's &quot;no way&quot; a mage should need it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mana Gem: Still a 2min CD, and not everyone will have it glyphed/(t5 trinket)/2set t7 bonus to gain more mana from it.<br />
Mana Pots: 1 per combat now, unless you die \o/<br />
Evocation: 4 min CD not specced, 2 min with. If you have it specced, you will likely have better regen anyway with SPI talents and regen. It channels, so you can lose it's effect to random damage or KB.<br />
Mage Armour: Some of us like Molten armour more, for the crit, given that helps MoE, and more so, the FFB mechanics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What the **** is Blizzard thinking?<br />
Hunters is everything in the fucking game combined into 1 class..<br />
They got ranged damage. DoT's. Dispel. Manadrain. Imbah CC. (Wyvern Sting, Wing Clip, Concussive shot, Scatter shot, frost trap, and freezing trap, which they plan to buff even more) Then they also have the pet in the game doing most damage (which they also plan to buff &quot;A new tier of hunter pet talents have been added. In particular, this allows Beastmaster hunters to improve their damage per second (DPS) with their 51 point talent.&quot;)<br />
The BM-tree also offer CC-immunity.<br />
Then they also have a 10 yard backward leap to get even more range, and that deflect-thingie.<br />
But that isn't quite enough, so why not give them an undispelable Healing-debuff aswell?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
mmmm, maybe you should stick to things you do know about?<br />
<br />
Yeah we have all the wonderful and useless things you listed. <br />
<br />
All pretty much useless for PVE.<br />
<br />
As for a buff to BM Hunters maybe you should llok at the fact that they now do so little damage you would be better off taking another tank into a raid. BM got nerfed so bad 3.08 that 90% of them changed spec and Blizzard are putting stuff back within a few weeks of the nerf...see 3.09.<br />
<br />
And please dont forget some people play PVE and who the *^&amp;% wants to take a hunter against a Mage etc if the hunter did not do high DPS....Think about it, would you?</div></div><hr />
