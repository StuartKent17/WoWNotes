Blizzcon - WoW Recap<br />
The Blizzcon came to an end yesterday, and even if obviously it wasn't as interesting as the previous one where WotLK was announced, we did hear a few new things about the upcoming expansion.<br />
Wrath of the Lich King<br />
Blizzard is already manufacturing discs and putting the final touches to WotLK<br />
<br />
Upcoming Patches<br />
Patch 3.1 will be the first content patch of the expansion and is already done. It will include Ulduar raid instance (10 and 25 Man) <br />
Patch 3.2 will add a new and still unknown raid instance to the game. <br />
Patch 3.3 will introduce Icecrown Citadel and should also resolve the storyline of Ashbringer.<br />
<br />
Upcoming changes<br />
In Patch 3.1, ground mounts will no longer dismount in water but will swim instead. <br />
10-Man and 25-Man sets will be part of the same set, you can complete your set bonuses with any part of each set. (Updated set stats available in the Raids &amp; Dungeons Panel post)<br />
<br />
Upcoming features<br />
The Dual-Talent spec feature will let you switch between your two specs without having to go back to town. You can perfectly do it between fights in a raid, however it won't be possible to switch specs in the middle of an Arena Match. Your keybinds and glyphs will be saved and automatically switched as you change your spec. An itemrack-like mod might also be added to the game to make switching even easier.<br />
New dances will be added in a content patch, one of the objective with the dance studio isn't to just add new dances but also let players combine moves to create their own dance.<br />
Guild ratings might be added in the future, guilds could receive a rating based on their PvE and PvP accomplishments. Achievements based on guild accomplishments could be added to the game as well. <br />
<br />
PvP<br />
They also want players to be able to level up in battlegrounds through XP rewards in addition of honor. Daily quests will also be added.<br />
They want to bring back competition into Battlegrounds, they're working on a new rating system to help with that and are also working on a way to let guilds compete in battlegrounds.<br />
In the future, players will be able to queue in Arenas and Battlegrounds from anywhere in the world.<br />
Strand of the Ancients is getting changed from 10vs10 to 15vs15. The amount of Vehicles is also being doubled.<br />
<br />
Misc.<br />
It seems that Ozzy Osbourne will be doing the next WoW what do you play commercial.<br />
There isn't any plan for a Blizzcon on the USA East Coast for the moment<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Movie<br />
WoW Movie is still something they're working on, and they DO have a draft of the script for the movie.<br />
<br />
Secret Project<br />
Blizzard's &quot;secret project&quot; is confirmed to be a new MMO with a brand new universe, but we won't hear anything about it before a while.<br />
<br />

Blizzcon - Art Panel Pictures<br />
We didn't report this one because we didn't any important announcement from it, if you're really interested in something else than pictures you can always check the writeup at WoWInsider (http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/10/10/notes-from-the-blizzcon-2008-art-panel/). (And I know you're going to hate me for posting over 100 thumbnails on the frontpage, but I actually did some optimization on all of them to make the front page lighter) <br />

They want to bring back competition into Battlegrounds, they're working on a new rating system to help with that and are also working on a way to let guilds compete in battlegrounds.<br />
In the future, players will be able to queue in Arenas and Battlegrounds from anywhere in the world.<br />
Strand of the Ancients is getting changed from 10vs10 to 15vs15. The amount of Vehicles is also being doubled.<br />

Now Blizzard tries to imitate Warhammer Online :P</div></div><hr />

War did not invent attack and defend, or siege weapons/vehicles.<br />
<br />
And they definitely didn't invent competitive large scale PVP (Battlegrounds).</div></div><hr />

From the looks of it, no, that's exactly what that project is. AND it's gonna be a 4th Blizzard universe.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I do believe someone else already stated that WOW has already used pvp to help to gain exp well before warhammer was even thought of, so get over it already.<br />
<br />
<br />
You and that person are right. For a long time, you could turn in 3 BG marks for exp. That's how I got a lot of my main's exp from 10 to 29, then 40-49. Which is why I have so many quests to do in Azeroth still...</div></div><hr />

Probably not. A while ago everyone was under the impression that that Project &quot;Hydro&quot; was the secret MMO project until some slides revealed that Hydra was actually D3.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it started with the singer from Level 80 Tauren Chieftain saying something along the lines of, &quot;Who played Diablo 3 earlier?&quot; *cheers from the crowd* &quot;Did you see the rainbow?&quot; and then it went on a bit and they introduced the &quot;new&quot; Diablo 3 logo (which was just a joke of course).<br />

One game in particular (Dark Age of Camelot, made by some unknown company called Mythic, who later on made some other unknown warhammer game...) seemed to have inspired a lot of ideas used in WoW.<br />
Amongst other things, levelling in battlegrounds (took years of player whining before they added /xpoff so players didn't need to suicide regularly to lose xp so their bg alts wouldn't level out of bgs), siege weapons, large scale battlegrounds (zone crash was the only limit to how many could be in the bg's at the same time.. which was hundreds).<br />
Only thing Blizz didn't copy from DAoC's battleground system yet was the free-for-all perpetual endless war without any fixed goal to &quot;win&quot;...<br />

That sure looks like pre-Archimonde Dalaran. Nothing too fancy about that, having Caverns of Time out there in Tanaris. Remember the &quot;New uber-secret raid in patch 3.2&quot;? Why not Dalaran while BC is summoned by Kel'Thuzad? Everyone gets &quot;undead form&quot; buff, much like you get human form in Durnhold, and go for it :)<br />
<br />
But I was wandering about that &quot;Dual Spec&quot; - is it scheduled for 3.0.1? Or will it be in a later patch? Couldn't figure that out from the post...</div></div><hr />

People tend to forget that the guys who made Warhammer actually also made Dark Age of Camelot that was out way before WoW..<br />
<br />
I don't mind they borrowed from War sicne these are great functions within War. Everythign to make the game better I'd say.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panoramixe</div><div class="date">2008-10-13, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The combat system, talent point system and a lot of WoW is actually inspired by diablo2, a game of Blizzard itself.<br />
If you look at WoW it's more or less the exact same gameplay-wise as diablo2 but then in the warcraft universe.<br />
<br />
But really, who care if companies look at eachother's games for ideas? Copying means less time and money spent on basic things and games can stand out in what they do different/better. If people need to reinvent fire, the wheel, electricity etc etc every time they want to make a new game they'd never be released since they'd be outdated by the time they come out.</div></div><hr />
