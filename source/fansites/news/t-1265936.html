PvP Season 12 Ending March 5<br />
Arena and Rated Battleground Season 12 is scheduled to end on Tuesday, March 5. At that point, we will determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards, a process that should take approximately one week. It's very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for Arena titles and/or the Malevolent Gladiator's Cloud Serpent to refrain from transferring their characters to another realm or faction until after Season 12 ends. The awarding of Season 12 titles and mounts will occur approximately 2 weeks after the season ends.<br />
<br />
At the end of the season, Conquest Points will be converted to Honor Points and any honor above 4000 will be converted to gold at a rate of 35 silver per point. The honor cap will remain at 4000.<br />
<br />
All Season 12 items will cost Honor Points (equivalent to their previous Conquest Point cost) when the season ends, with the exception of any items with rating requirements attached. These items will no longer be available for purchase.<br />
<br />
The next Arena and Rated Battleground season will begin approximately one week after the current season ends. During the break between seasons, all Rated Battleground and Arena matches will be unavailable. Team and Personal Ratings will be reset when Season 13 begins.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Testing Schedule - February 20<br />
On Wednesday, February 20, we will be testing more raid encounters in the Throne of Thunder.<br />
<br />
Note that we will likely be doing 25-player Normal testing (of many encounters) on Thursday and Friday. I'll post a schedule for those tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below for all Public Test Realms.<br />
<br />
Wednesday, February 20<br />
<br />
Horridon - 10 Player Heroic<br />
10:30 PST (13:30 EST, 19:30 CET)<br />
<br />
Ji-Kun - 10 Player Heroic<br />
13:30 PST (16:30 EST, 22:30 CET)<br />
<br />
Primordius - 10 Player Heroic<br />
16:00 PST (19:00 EST, 01:00 CET)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback. <br />

<br />
PTR Class and Set Bonus Issues<br />
Tuning Adjustments<br />
<br />
These are in addition to any previous changes, unless specifically noted.<br />
You can't just apply these to 5.1 numbers. You need to keep the entire suite of changes in mind. I say this because we always get a few players who only see -20% on some ability and get all &quot;Don't nerf me, bro.&quot;<br />
That said, feedback on these changes is always welcome. Numbers are more persuasive than feelings. PTR logs are better than simulations, since the latter are very dependent on the talent and time of the person doing the simming.<br />

<br />
Might of the Frozen Wastes (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/81333) to 20% melee damage, up from 10%.<br />
Icy Talons (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/50887) increases attack speed by 30%, up from 20%.<br />
Blood Plague (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/59879) and Frost Fever (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/55095) damage +30%.<br />
Howling Blast (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/49184) damage to primary target +23%. Damage to secondary targets remains unchanged. Note: the tooltip for secondary damage says 0.5 but it has been 0.8 for some time.<br />
Scourge Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/55090) damage +7.7%.<br />

<br />
We like our recent change to a lower cooldown on Avenging Wrath (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31884) for Retribution in PvP. We like it so much that we want to make it a baseline change for Retribution and not a set bonus, since many PvE paladins are benefiting from shorter wings today, and our recent DPS testing suggests that Ret needs a DPS buff. However, this does mean changing the existing T14 4pc PvE bonus. <br />
<br />
<br />
So the list of changes reads like this:<br />
<br />
Retribution has a two minute cooldown on Avenging Wrath (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31884) baseline.<br />
We are reverting the PvP set bonus change. The Retribution set bonuses remain as they are on live. This line will no longer appear in patch notes.<br />
We are changing the T14 4pc PvE bonus to +10% damage on Seals and Judgment (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20271). We want you to graduate to the T15 set bonus fairly quickly and you won't be losing the shorter Avenging Wrath (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31884) cooldown.<br />
Retribution damage was too low, but as I mentioned above, we buffed it through more frequent use of Avenging Wrath (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31884).<br />

<br />
Shadowform (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/15473) increases damage by 25%, up from 20%.<br />
We have heard some concerns that Atonement (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/81749) damage is higher than intended, so we are checking that out, but no changes to announce yet.<br />

Yes this is a nerf in a sea of buffs, but the Bloodsurge (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/46915) and Arms Deep Wounds (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115768) changes ended up being too much of a buff.<br />

Incinerate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/29722) damage +10%.<br />
<br />
<br />
For clarification, is the AoE aspect of Howling Blast (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/49184) going to be increased by this 23% single target buff, or will the AoE coefficient be lowered to compensate?<br />
Single-target buff. That's what I meant by damage to secondary targets remains the same.<br />
<br />
However, in case it wasn't obvious, these were all single-target changes. We haven't completed AE, healing or tanking changes. Healing or tanking numbers look pretty solid overall though, so don't expect much change there. (And feel free to disagree, but please provide some kind of evidence to back it up.)<br />
<br />
I want to play Unholy!<br />
We buffed Unholy early on in the patch and I did mention disease and Scourge Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/55090) buffs as well.<br />
<br />
You stated that shadow priest were overpowered in PVP and yet they received a 20% damage buff and now another 5% overall buff in Shadowform (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/15473) how does that make any sense?<br />
We're not convinced that Shadow's OPness in PvP came from overall damage. We think it is probably a combination of many things, and those we hit the hardest were healing and Phantasm (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108942). We did nerf the Mind Spike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/73510) glyph, which will reduce burst.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine so since FnB is just a multiplier on the existing spells.<br />
Correct.<br />
<br />
Hand of Gul'dan (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/105174), in metamorphasis form, is chaos wave. Does the 15% buff apply to the chaos wave too?<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Are there buffs designed to compensate for assassination getting less from the set bonuses?<br />
Partially. This is a challenge for us, because we need to take the set bonuses into account, but everyone needs to function with the old set bonuses as well. We try to look at both situations.<br />
<br />
Ret paladin damage will still be outclassed by other melee classes, causing us to be undervalued in the PvE scene, especially with the buffs to DK. <br />
We're not seeing Ret DPS below where we want it on live, except on AE or Cleave (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/845) fights, which these changes aren't targeted to correct. Again, as I mentioned above, you can't just take 5.1 numbers, mentally add these percentages to them and predict 5.2 numbers. I wish it was that easy, but a whole lot of things change. For example, we missed the mark on the current DK set bonuses, and they have been nerfed in 5.2.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm thoroughly confused to the Fury nerfs after the MINOR buff to WS, a move that is used AFTER everything else.<br />
Sorry, I brought too much focus to that one issue. Fury's DPS was just too high in 5.2 before these changes. It is a little high in 5.1 as well.<br />
<br />

Patch 5.2 PTR Notes - Feb 19 Update<br />
General<br />
<br />
New Daily Quest Hub: Isle of Thunder.<br />
<br />
Heroes fortunate enough to acquire a “Key to the Palace of Lei Shen” can bring it to the Shado-Pan on the Isle of Thunder and use it to infiltrate the fabled treasure vaults of the first emperor. Heroes are tasked with grabbing as much loot as they can within five minutes. Larger chests will have the most loot, including special keys that can be used at the end of the run for a chance at epic gear and other major rewards. Keys are awarded from rare mobs, hidden chests around the island, and from award satchels obtained by completing daily quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
Taking Over The Farm<br />
<br />
Players that have grown attached to working the land at Sunsong Ranch can now acquire purchase the farm land from Farmer Yoon via a quest. The farmhouse becomes a rest point like an Inn, where the player can bind and instantly log out. Work orders will pour into the farm from factions across Pandaria, and completing a work order will earn a reputation boost with the issuing faction.<br />
The option to take over the farm is available to characters that are exalted with the Tillers and have unlocked all 16 farm plots.<br />
Please note: The new Sunsong Ranch features are not available on the PTR, but will be coming soon.<br />

Divine Aegis (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/47515) now causes critical heals to apply an absorb shield on the target for 100% of the amount healed instead of healing for twice as much.

In addition, using Execute (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5308) makes Overpower (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/7384) free for 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Creatures<br />
<br />
Players of the same faction that participated in a fight with Pandaria world bosses (Sha of Anger, Galleon, Nalak the Storm Lord, and Oondasta) now get shared credit for the kill and will be eligible for loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids, Dungeons and Scenarios<br />
<br />
Satchels obtained via the Raid Finder now have a chance to contain additional rewards, including: consumables, Spirits of Harmony, rare pets or mounts, and Raid Finder versions of Normal and Heroic difficulty zone drops that were previously unavailable from Raid Finder encounters!<br />
Mogu Runes of Fate have been added and provides a bonus roll for Throne of Thunder, Nalak the Storm Lord, and Oondasta and are purchased with Lesser Charms of Good Fortune. Elder Charms of Good Fortune will continue to work in Mogu'shan Vaults, Heart of Fear, Terrace of Endless Spring, the Sha of Anger, and Salyis' Warband (Galleon).<br />
The maximum number of Elder Charms of Good Fortune a character can hold has been increased to 20 (was 10).</div></div><hr />

Tuning Adjustments<br />
<br />
These are in addition to any previous changes, unless specifically noted.<br />
You can't just apply these to 5.1 numbers. You need to keep the entire suite of changes in mind. I say this because we always get a few players who only see -20% on some ability and get all &quot;Don't nerf me, bro.&quot;<br />
That said, feedback on these changes is always welcome. Numbers are more persuasive than feelings. PTR logs are better than simulations, since the latter are very dependent on the talent and time of the person doing the simming.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes this is a nerf in a sea of buffs, but the Bloodsurge and Arms Deep Wounds changes ended up being too much of a buff.</div></div><hr />

It said 2 week until the season ends and the new one begins a week after that. 2 weeks would make it March 5</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, March 5th is the date of the END of the season, not the beginning. Thus by that logic, which sounds correct, patch day could be the 5th. I'm also not familiar with end to start dates of arena seasons so I could be completely wrong too.</div></div><hr />

Rather have them take away their &quot;buffs&quot;: bloodsurge and 50% haste and keep the 10% dmg and death from above glyph.<br />

<br />
Thing is that they did -10% nerf to our 3 main attacks. <br />
These 3 attacks are used as much as a:<br />
DK's: Obliterate, Frost strike, howling blast<br />
Ret's: TP, Crusader strike, Exorcism<br />
So hopefully you can see the frustration.<br /> 
Bloodsurge's wild strike is absolute crap and even if it was free it still is a last resort button. Arms buff does not apply to this situation. So these &quot;buffs&quot; are bull</div></div><hr />

As a Frost DK, I actually would love it if they would actually listen to us when we have been saying we need more mobility/survivability for close to three YEARS now, not more damage.<br />

Yes, they changed (nerfed) mastery to revert the nerfs to PoH and SS, and buffed PW:S to benefit from crit.<br />

The neutral charts on simulationcraft places Assassination on 25th! Thats way behind alot of the hybrid classes. Combat is 23rd and Sub 19th. That is VERY weak for a PURE dps class! <br />

Are you serious? Even now the autoattack damage is way too big % of our total damage done and in 5.2 you're pushing it even more since that bloodsurge-change doesn't increase the damage. As a Fury I have now way enough rage to just keep BT/CS on cd, use RB and just spam Heroic Strike. Some pathetic Deep Wounds buff ain't going to cut it, not even close.<br />
<br />
Maybe buffing Wild Strike damage would make it more attractive to use, otherwise it's just a button barely worth binding.<br />
<br />
Or is this Blizzards way of making so dull and boring Arms-spec the only option for PvE?<br />

I think we needed it, I find DK scaling poorly in lower level gear and this expansion is the first time that has happened.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but if you are in a group, where all players have the exactly same itemlevel in every slot....well, look for the assasin in the lower dps regions. Looking at theoretical dps charts....well, assasins are everytime in the lower part. And not only in theory....at the beginning of MoP some guild mates and me went through dungeons, all nearly the same item-lvl in all slots. It was a little wonder that the healer was not a place before me in dps. <br />
So it is time for a litte buff.<br />
<br />
Rogues are in a great place, both in simulation and in practise, you're probably doing something wrong.</div></div><hr />

Its about time they buffed MM and SV single target. Just made my day. Need patch now.</div></div><hr />

We don't need damage buffs. We need survivability buffs against melee. That's what DKs have been asking for. Not more damage.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magic Sausage</div><div class="date">2013-02-20, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dk's didn't need those damage buffs (frost). They needed some survivability tweaks. <br />
Ret doesn't need Avenging Wrath cd lowered, they need more sustained damage, less clunky mechanics.<br />
Destro and Demo got some much needed changes but Affliction remains untouched?<br />
Arcane needs to be completely reworked and Mage level 90 talents scrapped.<br />
Nice to see Ele receive the a buff for once but still need dispel protection for flame shock. <br />
<br />
I'm glad I heal/tank now because the roller-coaster that is playing dps was so annoying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even in PvE, frost DK doesn't last long during heavy physical damage periods when heals are lacking. Most classes have better damage reduction CDs.</div></div><hr />

I check the patch notes just about every day. All I ever see after locating the Warrior section is &quot;Arms: blah blah blah....&quot; I'm having trouble reconciling Blizzard's latest patch notes with what I've read in past 5.2 patch notes. Did I miss something?<br />
And yea, Fury Warriors only use Wild Strike when everything else is on CD.<br />
<br />
<br />
** I guess the outcry was loud enough for the nerfs to be retracted. :) A nerf on Execute along with a reduction of Reckless' CD are much more palatable.</div></div><hr />
