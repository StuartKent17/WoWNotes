Cataclysm Darkmoon Cards<br />
Just like previous expansions, Cataclysm will have its own set of Darkmoon Cards: Darkmoon Cards of Destruction (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86615/darkmoon-card-of-destruction/). The mechanics didn't really change and they're still crafted by Inscribers for a couple of uncommon inks + elemental life. <br />

Blue Posts<br />
GCD Usage and not thinking with your fingers<br />
We don't think so. It might be fun when you're looking at a target dummy, but then in an actual encounter with other players, you might find yourself sitting there looking at those two buttons without realizing that everyone else in the group is dead. Because you have such little time to look at anything besides those buttons, you aren't really playing as a group. You're just focused -- solely -- on maximizing your own rotation.<br />
<br />
We had a lot of complaints in LK that the complexity of managing a class rotation was at odds with the complexity we also add to the boss encounters. If anything we want to buy more space for the boss encounters, because those are at least varied, rather than simplify those while complexifying your rotation, which just makes every encounter feel the same. At the very least, we want to slow the game down a little so that you have more opportunity to make decisions with your head instead of every wipe being a mistake of the fingers.<br />
<br />
This is a subjective call, and we don't expect everyone to agree with it, but that's where we're coming from. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026395866/pally-tanking-in-cata/))<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
Mana Management and Overhealing<br />
I think the risk of overhealing will exist. If you're not doing so now, it's probably because you're in green or blue gear with relatively low crit rates. If the rogue takes 2K damage from a splash attack, and you use Divine Light, you'll probably overheal. If you're in a raid and both healers attempt to heal her, you'll almost certainly overheal.<br />
<br />
I agree that the risk of overhealing is key to mana management. There is more to healing than mana management though. The cast times and cooldowns of heals have a big role too. If you start casting a slow heal for a very wounded ally, then they might die. If you squander your cooldown then it's not going to be there for you when you really need it. Healers are also somewhat notorious for keeping everyone else up but forgetting to keep themselves alive. You just slip into the selfless role I suppose. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026375759/where-s-mah-mana-management/))<br />
<br />
Tanking<br />
Tanks with 100k HP 2-shot in Heroic<br />
If your tanks are taking 50K in a boss hit, then one of the following is most likely true:<br />
<br />
1) You are ignoring some mechanic of the fight (like debuffing or interrupting).<br />
2) You're talking about an isolated scary moment in the fight when you and the tank need to consider cooldowns.<br />
3) The encounter is bugged or overtuned. If you suspect this is the case, then provide specific feedback (the name of the boss at the very least) in the dungeons and raids forums (ideally the beta version).<br />
<br />
If you are a reasonably competent healer who uses a variety of heals and isn't spamming Divine Light on every trash pull, then you should be able to keep everyone alive. If your group isn't just ignoring encounter mechanics and trying to burn the boss down, then you shouldn't be running out of mana either. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026375759/where-s-mah-mana-management/))<br />
<br />
Vengeance<br />
As I said in the other thread just now, you shouldn't be dependent on Vengeance to maintain threat in 5-player dungeons. Vengeance scales slowly and falls off quickly for that reason -- we don't want that to be the system that lets you stay ahead. It's intended to help with raid scaling, not be a crutch for poor dps.<br />
<br />
As we have said several times, we don't want Prot paladins to fill every GCD. You also shouldn't need to in order to maintain threat.<br />
<br />
If you are having difficulties in PTR or on Beta, please let us know, but be as specific as you can. Who were you losing threat to? What kind of dps were they doing? Was it an AE or single target scenario? How was their gear relative to yours? We're unlikely to just buff threat generation based on generic &quot;I have threat problems&quot; reports. Specificity is the key here. It could very well be a bug on the side of the tank or the dps that is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
Remember that we very recently buffed the threat generation of Righteous Fury (and similar mechanics for the other tanks), so try and base your perceptions on very recent experiences. Things change pretty quickly at this stage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026395866/pally-tanking-in-cata/))<br />
<br />
Vengeance falling off<br />
It shouldn't translate to bosses though, because you shouldn't be dependent on Vengeance to keep threat. If Vengeance falls off, you shouldn't immediately wipe. That's not the intent. We don't want Vengeance to be the ultimate threat ability. It will eventually stack up and generally stay that way. It shouldn't be a razor's edge for you being able to keep threat.<br />
<br />
-- The rouge pulls as soon as the fight starts -- a tank problem perhaps, but not a Vengeance problem. (It could also be that the rogue is hitting the wrong target or not waiting for the tank.)<br />
-- The healer's hots pull mob #5 in an AE situation -- a tank problem perhaps, but not a Vengeance problem. (It could also be that the tank is terrible at generating threat.)<br />
-- Six minutes into a boss fight, the mage starts to creep up on your threat -- this is a Vengeance problem. (It could also be that the tank isn't doing a good job hitting their main attacks.)<br />
<br />
The reason we keep downplaying Vengeance in 5-player dungeons, which is all anyone is running at the moment on beta, is because it's not a dungeon mechanic. If you need a comparison, think of something like Fortitude or Blessing of Kings. It's nice but not at all mandatory for even heroic 5-player runs. It's pretty close to mandatory for a raid. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026396221/vengeance-my-arguments-for-change/))<br />
<br />
Tank Threat<br />
We don't want tank threat to be so high that the dps are absolved of all responsibility. If players are on the wrong targets, that is a L2P problem. If the mage opens with Arcane Blast before you even get a hit in, that is a L2P problem. If your group feels like they have to wait 6-10 seconds before they can start attacking, then that's either a tank problem or a problem on our end. Likewise, if your group feels constantly throttled several seconds or minutes into the fight, then either you aren't generating as much threat as you are capable of, or our numbers are preventing you from doing so.

Divine Plea<br />
Your calculations seem to assume that damage comes in at a steady rate and so you can just solve for when to use Divine Plea. But damage usually doesn't work like that. You should use Divine Plea at the right time, which doesn't always mean as soon as you start to get low. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026395283/crusade-for-divine-plea/))<br />
<br />
Using all your GCDs<br />
Yes, and we have said this a lot, so it shouldn't come as a surprise. In a nutshell, the problem with filling every single GCD is it gives you no room to do anything else. If you're called upon to do something special or even run away or even look around to see how the fight is going, you don't have the cognitive space to do so. If we give you a proc to use and your rotation is so locked then you can't use the proc, then we have a problem. If you literally can't stand to go 1.5 sec every now and then without hitting a button, then our game has serious problems. :(<br />
<br />
I know this is really weird for paladins who just have the muscle memory of always hitting something -- anything -- every GCD. It will take some getting used. Just try to evaluate whether it's truly not fun or whether it's just really different. Having any class that hits a button every 1.5 seconds is something we're trying to move away from though. We don't think it's good for the game.<br />
<br />
You should not be using Hammer of the Righteous or Inquisition on single target fights, because there are better alternatives. Holy Wrath is designed to be used in both single target or group fights. (And if you can't use Holy Wrath because of breaking CC concerns, then back the target away or just hold off on Holy Wrath for the time being -- same as a warrior using Thunder Clap). I would use Avenger's Shield on both single target or group fights, though it can be used in a lot of different ways, so if you need to silence a caster, then I would use some common sense there. I would use Consecrate for groups, particularly for spawning or moving groups. If you have the mana to use it single target, then go for it. Exorcism is probably too expensive to ever be a serious Protection ability. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026395866/pally-tanking-in-cata/))<br />
<br />
Tanking abilities<br />
This keeps coming up, so let me just spell it out.<br />
<br />
Single target abilities: Crusader Strike, Shield of the Righteous, Judgement, Holy Wrath, Consecrate (maybe), Avenger's Shield.<br />
<br />
AE abilities: Hammer of the Righteous, Inquisition, Judgement, Holy Wrath, Consecrate, Avenger's Shield.<br />
<br />
That's ignoring things like Divine Protection, Word of Glory, Hammer of Justice, Hammer of Wrath, etc.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't just hit all of those on cooldown though. Sometimes you want to position Consecrate, as you point out, or save Avenger's Shield to deal with adds. Sometimes you risk breaking CC. Sometimes you might want to blow a cooldown or use a Hand or something else. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026395866/pally-tanking-in-cata/))<br />
<br />
Threat generation and GCD<br />
I see two different arguments keep coming up.<br />
<br />
The first is that you can't generate enough threat without more buttons to push. This isn't our design and it sounds like threat may still just be too tight in some circumstances. More GCDs does not have to be the answer to threat situations though. If Avenger's Shield hit for 60K then you'd have a healthy threat lead for a long time.<br />
<br />
The second argument is that you just like having to hit something every single global. This isn't a &quot;I can't function&quot; complaint like the one above. It's a personal preference. We don't think there is anything sacred about the 1.5 sec GCD. I think current paladins have just grown accustomed to hitting a button every 1.5 sec. But we don't think the current paladin plays well. We don't like the 969 rotation. If you do, I understand, but it isn't coming back.<br />
<br />
Let's get the threat situation ironed out and see how the Protadin plays for you then. At worst some of you may find the spec boring, but a lot of players find it boring on live, so we're not really out much there. If playing it is less EZ mode on the other hand, it might be more interesting to you or perhaps to other players who never paid the class much attention before. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026395866/pally-tanking-in-cata/))<br />
<br />
Protection Paladin rotation complexity (I strongly suggest that you read the whole Paladin Tanking Thread (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026395866/pally-tanking-in-cata/))<br />
This was a problem though, because the Protection paladin was a fairly easy spec to play well while the other 3 tanks had a lot more they had to manage. It was frustrating for the warriors, druid and death knights to have to give it their all just to keep up with a novice paladin. (To be fair, the other option is just to make everyone more autopiloty.)<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong. We often ask a lot of tanks in terms of moving the boss, knowing when the big hits are coming, and so on. We don't want the paladin rotation to be John Madden, and we don't everything to collapse if you fail to hit Crusader Strike at the right time. I'm getting the impression that threat is on the razor's edge for a lot of you, which is going to make everything feel too restrictive and frustrating. It could be a level 80 issue (since we have spent most of our time balancing at 85) or it could be that players are doing different things that we are doing internally or seeing on the beta. We watch a lot of dungeons, but we don't catch everything. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026395866/pally-tanking-in-cata/))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / 3.3.5 Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior#,,12213) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..warrior) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1676-Warrior-Cataclysm))<br />
Enrage uptime<br />
We think it's dumb for Enrage to be up 100% of the time. What's the point? It should just be tacked on to Defensive Stance at that point. We aren't going to balance warrior dps around it being up 100% in Cataclysm if in fact it is not up 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
Virtually every number related to Prot warriors changed, so it's difficult to just compare a -5% here and a +5% there to figure out if your dps went up or down. The most helpful thing you can do is report on differences you notice before or after a PTR copy / beta conversion or even how you stack up relative to other tanks or other dps. <br />
<br />
Warrior DPS is lacking<br />
Unfortunately, &quot;most agree that prot warrior dps is lacking&quot; is not an actionable item. I need something more concrete than that to take to my team. Is your dps lower than it is on live? How much lower? In what circumstances? Is it lower than other tanks? How much lower? In what circumstances?<br />
<br />
To be clear, there is nothing wrong with being vague. Maybe your post will spur someone else to chime in with more details in agreement or disagreement. Just don't make the leap from &quot;My dps feels low&quot; to &quot;Why haven't they buffed me yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
In the specific case of AEs such as Thunder Clap, we don't want them to be so powerful that they can hold threat all on their own. We don't want the AE tanking rotation to be just TC and Shockwave. If you are killing things one at a time, then you should make additional attacks to the next target to be killed and Thunder Clap should be sufficient to prevent healer aggro or the like.

Seriously, though, Blizz is not making many friends with the changes to tanking and healing (especially the latter). Tanking is difficult enough on live, it sounds like it will just be more difficult when Cata hits. GC even said that there were two options with tanking: Make all tanks more like Protection Paladins who were relatively easy to play, or make Prot Pallies more difficult. They chose the second option incorrectly for one main reason: Not enough people tank in WoW. It's a frustrating, thankless job and this expansion will only make more people NOT want to do it. People have no patience for a tank learning how to do the job. They want perfection and they want it now. Poor experiences will drive people to ditch tanking and just DPS because it's easier, and imo that means Blizz is doing something horribly wrong.<br />
<br />
Healing will go from &quot;spam to keep everyone alive&quot; to &quot;keep the tank alive and maybe heal the DPS so I don't go OOM&quot;. I cringe at the thought of how rude an awakening this is going to be for moronic DPS, which is most of them. I can be relieved that I'll at least be okay on my Elemental Shaman, since that is one of the best hybrid specs in the game when it comes to emergency healing. I'll be able to keep myself alive so that the healer can concentrate on more important matters.</div></div><hr />

The fact that you somehow find tanking or healing more challenging in any way than dps'ing in this game just means that you are a bad player, not that tanks and healers are MIT graduates and dps'ers are Down's victims that couldn't handle anything else. Your apparent admiration for said roles is misplaced.

Well, as a mage i now have iceblock, Mage Ward, Mana shield, Blink, CAuterize (fire) and a few more, to save the healers mana, it's all about using your spells correctly, and you won't have problems, but i agree that so many DPS are stupid beyond repair, so Cataclysm will be a rude awakening for those people.</div></div><hr />

As you said, it depends on the enrage timer, and in case of hard modes, especially when you're progressing through the tier for the first time, that can be a pretty big deal. Anyway, the point i'm trying to get across is that there's no inherent difficulty increase when you play a healer or a tank, just different priorities and a different mindset, but you definitely don't need to be a rocket scientist to tank or heal.<br />

It's kind of hard to compare difficulty between three drastically different roles. I, personally find tanking and healing to be more or less difficult depending on the fight. Healing LK? Much more difficult to heal than to dps (imo, since I've done both. Opinions may differ.) I can't really speak on tanking though, since I've only tanked very briefly and didn't enjoy it due to people being mean. &lt;/3 &quot;amg nub pull faster, amg you pulled too much nububuubb&quot; <br />

its basically the same. if you suck you suck.<br />
if you are good nobody notices except ppl with half a brain cell.<br />
its easy to tell a good tank from a bad.<br />
its not &quot;that&quot; easy to tell that from a heal if you dont heal yourself.<br />
its not &quot;that&quot; easy as well, to tell that from a dps because often times ppl underestimate the value a good dps can have for the raid apart from DPS.<br />
you will notice that if you raid with a good ret pally or spriest or moonkin. every class has stuff to contribute to a raid that dumb people like to oversee.<br />
stop saying that playing a dps is easy. playing everything in wotlk now is easy. <br />
but playing it well is really really hard. if you think you know what playing well means than just try to look at the top guilds in the world there you will probably see what good play is.<br />
and that you cant get it down to &quot; stand in the fire&quot; or &quot; not standing in the fire&quot; when you talk about whether you can see if somebody is good or not.<br />
thats the most basic one but ppl should have overcome that already.<br />
<br />
imho as a raidleader i value dps that are top notch much more than tanks and healers that are top.<br />
why ?<br />
because a tank has a very simple job.<br />
a healer has a very simple job + dispelling <br />
a dps has a very simple job and a HUUUUUUUGGEEEE range to improve.<br />
and after that you can improve yourself in supporting the raid while you do your dps buisiness.<br />
<br />
really.<br />
stop stating that playing dps is more easier than other stuff.<br />
because it isnt if you want it to be good.<br />
<br />
and thats said by someone that tanks/heals all the time :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it changes a lot between fights. Currently, I feel most fights are easier to tank than heal in ICC(done both on all fights on normal, few on heroic), especially 25man. It's hard to compare the two of them and dps; it just takes a vastly different mindset, and when doing pugs, much thicker skin since everything can(and will) be blamed on the tank, healer, or both. Most people apparently want to see big numbers; those of us that don't care for it and would rather tank or heal, are very much a small minority.<br />
<br />
We are going to see much longer queues for dps for random 5mans, because any tank or healer with good guild probably will not do randoms if they can avoid it. Wrath made tanking and healing both easier, but at the same time it made heroics so easy that most dipshit dps lost the little respect they had for the meatwall between them and the mobs, much less for the one keeping them alive through stupid. I know I will not tank nor heal a single pug 5man in the starting months, and I will enjoy the slightly harder tanking and healing with my guildies. I doubt I am the only one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 3 tank chars, 4 healers and a few ranged and melee dps classes which I play, I raid regularly on mains and do pugs with the rest. I have cleared ICC on both 10 and 25 man, 11/12 bosses on 10HC, and 7/12 on 25HC. That said, I do find dpsing being the easiest part. Almost always dps can handle their job even with only using one hand, occasionally side-stepping with A and D out of fires on the ground, but it's always the tanks and healers who have to step in and correct the mistake if a dps does something wrong; if a dps goes and pulls stuff it's the tank who has to fix that, and if a dps stands in fires or something and is near death it's the healer who has to correct that. It's as if most of the responsibility is just automatically transferred to tanks and healers and dps takes the blame only in the case they make a really clear mistake which instantly kills them, they don't take blame if it doesn't instantly kill them because then healers or tanks are expected to do something about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know I will not tank nor heal a single pug 5man in the starting months, and I will enjoy the slightly harder tanking and healing with my guildies. I doubt I am the only one.<br />
<br />
Indeed you aren't. In general I don't like the changes, for several reasons, and I don't want to listen to impatient bastards whining to me when they die due to a mistake of their own doing. So, either I just go dps with all my chars, or tank/heal only when I can get a group with only those people I am familiar with.</div></div><hr />

i dont know why you think that &quot;doing their job&quot; is something that burdens someone.<br />
its the friggin job of a healer to heal so you find it nice for healers to not need to heal so much in a fight ?<br />
man, i dont know.<br />
i play a holy paladin and the worst thing is that i stand around being able to do nothing than overhealing because no one gets damage.<br />
ofc &quot;responsibility&quot; is transferred. thats what a job is for.<br />
vica versa, dps have the huge responsibilty of dpsing &quot;good&quot; and everyone who has hit tight enrage timers knows that this can be much more of a burden than just &quot;do their job and heal guys that stand in the fire&quot;. there are so many not avoidable or hard to avoid damage abilities that its nothing extraordinary to ask from a healer or a tank to just do their job.<br />
everyone has responsibilities in a raid.<br />
and tbh its not difference if a healer or a tank just moves an inch or is a clicker or plays one handedly.<br />
in fact i noticed that the number of ppl doing it does not vary much.<br />
in the last casual guild i was almost no tank/heal/dps used hotkeys to the extend that i do, therefore they clicked. <br />

And I mean its not like your going to turn 85 as soon as it comes out, you'll have new dungeons to get used to this new format of tank/healing.

And what do Scribes do? Inscribe. So you might call them... inscribers! The OP's use of the word Inscriber is absolutely legitimate. *headache*<br />

You're not really reading what I wrote. It's one thing to heal something that is unavoidable, and a completely other thing to heal something that is perfectly avoidable, but is not avoided anyway because of laziness or not paying attention and then getting blame for it yourself.<br />

Try raiding with tanks or healers who play like that: you won't get far. But with dps like that you can still get a lot further as long as you stay beneath the enrage timer. That is, all the hard work is transferred to tanks and healers.<br />
<br />
<br />

i love the healing that i was able to experience in the beta so far, as well as that i love the fact that you can really shine being a good healer / tank / dps now which is kind of more rewarding than in wotlk.<br />

Also DPS using all these new survivability cool downs that everyone keeps screaming are &quot;PvP changes&quot;. Every DPS spec that I can think of is getting pretty major survivability and/or self healing stuff added in, people are going to have to learn to use them. The attitude of &quot;I kill things, everything else is the healer or tank's responsibility&quot; isn't going to fly. At least not until we over-gear content.</div></div><hr />

dont say dpsing is easier or has less of a responsibility. if you think so you havent seen what a good dps can do.<br />
<br />
This is such an ignorant thing to say.<br />
<br />
Healers and tanks are there to keep people alive from the inevitable damage that comes in an encounter, be it room damage, aoe boss damage, adds, etc., and yes, even the occasional DPSer mistake.<br />
That doesn't mean it's their job to keep morons alive when they can't learn how to move correctly or watch their aggro.<br />
<br />
Learning positioning and movement and management is everybody's job, not just healers and tanks. Damage mechanics are the consequences of failing. You do something wrong, you get hurt for it. They are there to make people learn. <br />
Fights shouldn't be Heals/Tanks doing it right so that the DPS can do whatever the fuck they want because they know someone's going to come in and save them. <br />
<br />
As it's already been said, over-gearing in Wrath is the reason healing and tanking is considered boring / ez right now. I know lots of spell casters who heal in their DPS specs because it's that simple to do. <br />
DPS players are spoiled / lazy because of Wrath gearing mechanics. I would know, I've done all 3 roles (lock for DPS, pally for tanking, shaman for heals). They expect to be able to just faceroll whatever and not have to pay attention. <br />
<br />
That's going to change in Cataclysm. I for one have no problem not healing someone in pugs or not taunting off of someone who can't target my target and/or hold their aggro. I will most definitely apply this to pugs in Cata, I'm not putting up with selfish DPSers.</div></div><hr />

It is only through the arbitrary nature of the English language that the previous isn't 100% true. In MOST cases all 4 are valid.<br />
<br />
In Latin, the neuter and past participle is always the same:<br />
transcriptum, neuter of transcriptus, past participle of transcribere<br />
scriptum, scriptus, scribere<br />
<br />
With transcript, all 4 are correct with &quot;-ptionist&quot; used more than &quot;-ber&quot;<br />
<br />
And that's because Latin is less arbitrary than English. <br />

if you have 5 stupid dps in your guildraid and you cant exchange them cause you lack the manpower what do you do ? not heal them so they die and you wipe and wipe and wipe ? now thats what i call selfish. and stupid by the way.<br />
if you really think thats we way of playing healer, so they &quot;learn&quot; the hard way then you will probably be more of a burden to your raid than they are.<br />
if you really think they learn that way then you are wrong.<br />
this way of teaching people wont work. try dialogue. helps much more often.<br />
that is, of course if you can make it sound much less arrogant.<br />
<br />
not healing someone in pugs or taunting back aggro is about the same thing. of course it gives you the feeling of having bashed that noobs face cause now he is dead and you can laugh behind your pc knowing that you really showed him &gt;.&lt; thats hilarious. <br />
<br />

That's how, next question?<br />
But even the best writers (often followed by editors, copy-editors, and occasionally even &quot;test readers&quot;) make typos. I've seen typos in novels, legal briefs, research papers (by established PhDs, not just undergraduate papers), literally anything that can be written. Often the people who produced these documents were both excellent writers themselves and had teams of excellent people who double checked them. Perfection is something none of us can aspire to even under the best of circumstances, and an off the cuff forum post is hardly the best of circumstances.<br />

Nope, we all know it's totally Inscriptionist, as scribe is always proven wrong as the less broad term only related to markings on the surface, rather than markings into the surface, such as glyphs and inscription enchants. :P<br />

The fact of the matter is, Inscriptionist has been and is still used and yet doesn't actually exist in any current dictionary, that is all I was getting at. Maybe if Latin wasn't a dead language what you are saying might be relevant, but I think you're stretching it a bit and taking pedantic to a whole new level, which is what I was trying to make light of in the first place by replying to the guy that said Inscriber isn't something you'd refer to a Scribe by.</div></div><hr />

Your apparent admiration for said roles is misplaced. There are just as many morons tanking or healing as there are dps'ing, we all push the same keys on a keyboard and we all have to move out of the same fire.<br />
<br />
....No it's pretty simple. Tanks, and healers are by far the more intelligent for the most part. Dps does what? Stand around and try to catch their drool in a bucket so they don't mess up their shirt. &quot;Ohhzzz I haz big nomberz, I iz pwnage&quot;. Yeah, way to go, retard. <br />
<br />
You can't blame dps though, blizz's idea to fix this is make instances require more crowd control. That was just bad design when there is so much more they could do. What about interactivity? Oh, hey let's make mobs just hit for so much more that if you don't cc them they one shot your tank. Wow, good job on just raising numbers. People may not want to admit it but there are some interesting mechanics to be taken from wrath (newest so best example)<br />
<br />
A great fight is Devourer of Souls. Why not give a link effect to some trash, say the healers of the group. That would make this whole concept of &quot;o.k. cc&quot; o.k. NOW aoe tank, as opposed to wrath where they just skip the cc part. Look at the videos, CC isn't some integral part of it now. It's just a step to doing the same aoe tanking as in wrath. Even TB admitted as much. Now if they made it so that if the healer got cced and activated his mirror soul, not only would it free him and redirect damage but also cc the person who cced him. Then you are getting fun. It would make the dps do more than go o.k. I need 5 buttons now instead of 4. 1 is CC 2345 aoe damage macros. Good to go. <br />
<br />
This isn't a QQ thread, because honestly Blizz won't change anything now. They don't care if I qq or nerd rage and quit wow. This is a business, and they won't miss my account so I won't threaten to quit. What I will do play fable 3, keep paying blizz and shut up and deal with it till Guild Wars 2 launches or Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic. You should all know guild wars, half of wow is stolen from them. I swear sometimes while playing wow I feel like they should be paying for permission. And bioware, the most epic game company ever. <br />

If you're called upon to do something special or even run away or even look around to see how the fight is going, you don't have the cognitive space to do so. If we give you a proc to use and your rotation is so locked then you can't use the proc, then we have a problem. If you literally can't stand to go 1.5 sec every now and then without hitting a button, then our game has serious problems.&quot;<br />

<br />
As a tank or healer, if you perform below par... you are almost guaranteed to wipe the raid.<br />
<br />
Healers and Tanks have to play perfect, whilst DPS can slack (if they want to).<br />
<br />
Correct. No slacking as Healer or Tank and requires much more awareness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meh if I don't perform someone else will pick it up / or I can stand in fire because the healers will keep me alive..&quot; <br />
Try that as Tank/Healer and thanks for making us work extra hard..</div></div><hr />

<br />
also considering both ret and holy have multiple HP generators it seems unfair that prot is stuck with only one, and not a very well tuned one at that. make AS have a chance to generate HP, give prot a blood rage ability to generate HP out of combat or shorten the cs/hotr cooldown a little. something.<br />
<br />
as a paladin i'm stuck using aoe attacks like consecrate on a single target because a. i have nothing better to do because everything else is on cooldown for another 3 seconds and b. that mage insisted on blowing all his cooldowns on the boss before i even hit it and consecrate is the only thing i have available to me.<br />

I have cleared ICC on both 10 and 25 man, 11/12 bosses on 10HC, and 7/12 on 25HC. That said, I do find dpsing being the easiest part. Almost always dps can handle their job even with only using one hand, occasionally side-stepping with A and D out of fires on the ground, but it's always the tanks and healers who have to step in and correct the mistake if a dps does something wrong; if a dps goes and pulls stuff it's the tank who has to fix that, and if a dps stands in fires or something and is near death it's the healer who has to correct that. It's as if most of the responsibility is just automatically transferred to tanks and healers and dps takes the blame only in the case they make a really clear mistake which instantly kills them, they don't take blame if it doesn't instantly kill them because then healers or tanks are expected to do something about it.<br />
<br />
Indeed you aren't. In general I don't like the changes, for several reasons, and I don't want to listen to impatient bastards whining to me when they die due to a mistake of their own doing. So, either I just go dps with all my chars, or tank/heal only when I can get a group with only those people I am familiar with.<br />
<br />
All I heard is blah blah blah WoW is hard. I am soo happy healing is being made an actual challenge again and not just the spam 1 button till the encounter ends cause LOLINFINITEMANA. If any of you newer players were around and raiding a good few years ago you would notice that a lot of these changes are not really changes at all, but mostly just a rollback to the way healing was during the later parts of Vanilla and most of Burning Crusade.<br />

What is hard is dealing with all the people that play with the WotLK mindset, have the attention span of a squirrel and refuse to adapt even if it means an excruciating virtual death.<br />
<br />
These DMC look pretty bad though, I thought they were trying to make things exciting in this expansion, so far the racials are almost the same, the talents have not really been made more exciting at all and the lesser itemized stats and removal of stats all together just make things seem more bland rather than more exciting. For shame!<br />

That's the most stupid thing I've read so far in this thread. I assume you've made typos before in your line of work/studies, does this make you bad at them?
