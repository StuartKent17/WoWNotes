PvP Zones Update - Lake Wintergrasp and Strand of the Ancients<br />
The articles for Lake Wintergrasp (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=815) and Strand of the Ancients (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=816) are here ! In both articles you will find a summary of what we know about each zone (mostly from the WWI until we can access them on Beta servers), a few screenshots (pictures of the WWI PvP Panels included), and hopefuly a few more things in the upcoming days. <br />

Dungeons Update - Chamber of Aspects and Eye of Eternity<br />
Today we're also adding the Chamber of Aspects (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=813) and The Eye of Eternity (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?tab=1&amp;page=814) to our dungeon pages. As far as we know both zones are single-encounter raid dungeons, the first one will let you fight a black dragon named &quot;Sartharion, the Onyx Guardian&quot;. The Eye of Eternity is the last dungeon of the Nexus and will let you face Malygos himself ! <br />

Badge of Justices / Arena &amp; Honor Points in WotLK<br />
The current Badges of Justice should still be obtainable via level 70 heroic dungeons after Wrath of the Lich King launches but only used for level 70 gear. We currently plan to continue with a badge type of system, but new ones will drop in Wrath of the Lich King. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8557297999&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#18))<br />
We talked about this a bit in the last episode of BlizzCast, like how we plan to expand on the system and possibly have different tiers of badges and such, so this can't come as a big surprise that you can't stack up 800 Badges of Justice and buy level 80 gear right away.

Defense is usually a pretty easy stat to max out with gear, whereas you can't really do that on dodge. We saw some tanks actually spec out of Anticipation at the T6 or so level because it just stops being as useful as your gear improves. Hit is another stat we don't really like to hit in talent trees, since it's possible to hit the cap with gear alone.

The problem with the old Shield Block was it was never a choice. It was available so often, and always so useful, that you could just about put a brick on the key you use for Shield Block. We're trying to get Shield Block to feel more like a mini-Shield Wall. Use it when Something Bad is about to happen. We're not trying to nerf it -- we're trying to make it more fun. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8557366167&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=2000#15))<br />
We have to be careful with this talent (Stalwart Protector) because prot warriors are going to generate a lot more rage than before, just because their dps is going to be higher. A lot of tanking gear comes with strength now. Strength is a good stat, and even before the shield block change, it was probably the best +threat stat you have. I sort of feel that for too long we have all emphasized mitigation as the primary role of a tank, when in reality it's only half the job. Doing more dps will let tanks be more fun when not-tanking, and for warriors, might make a lot of rage starvation issues go away.

Living Bomb - We've considered giving it a knock back or *ahem* &quot;knock up&quot; but we felt that probably wouldn't be desired for what Living Bomb is made for. It works for Thunderstorm (Elemental Shaman Talent) because Shaman's aren't an AOE class, and because it's cooldown controlled.

Like I promised, the paladin changes were more sweeping than most changes.

Aggro Generation of Aegis / Shields - I am concerned about this, and will make sure it's not too much of a problem. If it is, we can always do a glyph or talent that causes the target to regen rage/runic power etc. when they absorb damage through your spells. That will be a last resort, however.

If you've noticed a lot of the ranks have similar mana costs, though I do agree Mind Sear's mana cost seems particularly high... I've been assured that the mana costs for the new ranks of spells and for the new spells are accurate in relation to the mana pools players will have with the new itemization. We'll make sure the mana cost isn't offensive when we do some internal raid testing in the coming weeks. We also made the ability not work on the primary target because we didn't want Mind Sear to be used as a ghetto Mind Flay and because we found it was annoying when the target you were casting Mind Sear on died, causing you to re-cast it.

The devilsaur is an exotic pet that will ultimately require 51-BM to tame. There are several other exotic pets that are not implemented yet. (The moth is not an exotic pet.) The size of the devilsaur is not a bug, but I also can't promise it's going to stay that way. It would be awesome if it did, but only if it doesn't cause a bunch of other problems, like clipping through terrain and making it impossible to see mailboxes in Dalaran.

<br />
&quot;300 HP&quot;? lol, the only thing paladins had to have besides the &quot;default warrior tank stats&quot; is spelldamage, and not that much (just look at a bunch of prot paladins using almost full prot warrior gear without spelldamage, even choosing the prot warrior 2.4 badge gear instead of the paladin ones). Warrior not having strengh on its gear is a huge threat nerf while paladins not having it is a plus (only enchanting spellpower instead of mongoose on his weapon + any ubber badge gear with spelldamage and you're done with it).<br />
<br />
Higher mitigation and survival is what warriors were all about. Warriors suck at aoe tanking while paladins shine at it. People didn't understand that and think that paladins should be exactly the same as a warrior, but with the plus of powerfull aoe tanking abilities (and get pissed that blizzard gave a ghetto aoe 51-talent skill for prot warriors).<br />
<br />
People even choose Druids over Warriors for high hitting bosses 'cause they can eat crushing blows in a way a warrior or paladin will never be able.<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, with the WotLK changes DK's, Wars and Pallies will all use virtually the same gear, so they might tweak the % a bit.<br />
<br />
It seems to have been un-buffed last update. Regardless, HS is what it is because pallies are meant to have the edge in AoE situations.<br />
<br />
You get Last Stand on 6 minute (!!!!) cooldown.<br />
<br />
Pally &quot;shield wall&quot; is also 50%, war is 75%.<br />
<br />
Spellpower remains the same for paladins and strengh was a useless stat for them, now they'll be able to use it to increase even more their spellpower (all that while paladins get damage buffs from spellpower in their spells that they didn't had or were small buffs), while for warriors, strengh was, is and will still be a powerfull stat, that we'll only have (back) in wotlk, and you'll not get a &quot;%str to crit chance or increased threat for each ability&quot; like paladins will get for spellpower (remember, holy damage bypass mitigation, while damage from str not).<br />
<br />
And please, I think that every warrior would choose the 4 min/50% shield wall instead of 30min/75% one. (and lol, last stand will never surpass a shield wall utility, lol and pallies have LoH, wich is powerfull now in wotlk with 20min CD and not draining all mana).<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors Shield Slams can proc free insta-slams. Warrior shield slams dispell effects. Warrior shield bashes can potentially silence.<br />
<br />
You can only proc free insta-slam if you actually use one, if you loose threat, you loose rage, without rage, no slam, no free slams (and remember, talented and only 2% chance of that happening). Blizzard says that prot warriors will gain rage even without getting hit by the mob, but... yet to be seen.<br />
<br />
Dispel is more usefull for PvP and shield bash silence is talented (and not that usefull in PvE... tons of *immune* mobs).<br />
<br />
<br />
Pallies can now finally compete with warriors as tanks, and it's about time!<br />
<br />
Only in WotLK? Do you play WoW since the prot paladin revamp in 2.0 or stopped before 2.0 and trying again when wotlk launches? Currently, Paladins ARE the 1st tank choice in TBC, be it 5-man/heroic, 10-man raid or 25-man raid. Warriors and Druids became the situational tankers (when you need charge/intercepts, spell reflect, mobs are immune to spell damage...). The only reason prot warriors are still used in 5-man/heroics is because we are on a shortage of tankers on most servers, so, most of the time you can't choose what type of tanker you'll take and instead take the one that is avaiable. Altough sometimes I see ppl asking for prot paladins only even with this tank avaiability problem.<br />
<br />
I bet you never been removed from a ZA raid because you can't aoe tanking there easily. Go play a prot warrior and get removed after the bear boss or not even get into the raid group 'cause they will try the timer, where you can't keep changing ppl and loose precious time and using a paladin against the bear boss would be the same (while using a warrior for the gauntlet is not).<br />
<br />
Paladins have blessings (and for now, BoS!) where warriors can only shout one buff for the entire party (and only 2 mins wasting a much needed rage for threat skills). Wanna Kings/Salv of battle shout? lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you ever played a pally you'd get tired of the constant &quot;SHUT UP AND HEAL FGT&quot; psts.<br />
<br />
Playing as a prot paladin in PvP? LoL. Not that they're not usefull in PvP, but that's the only place where a prot paladin could hear that. If you're tanking and ppl says that to you, please, leave the group, they aren't good players and the run will only give you repair costs from wipes.<br />

<br />
Blizzard is trying to make all tanks viable in all situations, so you don't have to rely on 'gimmick' abilities, and I for one, respect that wish. Each tank will still have his specialty, but will 'borrow' some key skills from other classes. I understand that tank envy is a terrible thing, but there's no sense in complaining about other classes ability to tank better than you in certain situations. If you're going to worry about how your class should be improved so you can be better than other classes, why not switch your focus and worry about how TANKS can be improved? After all, shouldn't we be complaining about that rogue that consistently pulls aggro instead of beating on our chests and trying to prove that warriors are better than pallys or visa versa? All I'm saying is that all us tanks are in this together.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tycho</div><div class="date">2008-08-01, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;300 HP&quot;? lol, the only thing paladins had to have besides the &quot;default warrior tank stats&quot; is spelldamage, and not that much (just look at a bunch of prot paladins using almost full prot warrior gear without spelldamage, even choosing the prot warrior 2.4 badge gear instead of the paladin ones). Warrior not having strengh on its gear is a huge threat nerf while paladins not having it is a plus (only enchanting spellpower instead of mongoose on his weapon + any ubber badge gear with spelldamage and you're done with it).<br />
<br />
Spell damage is an expensive stat. Virtually every warrior item has far more avoidance/mitigation compared to the pally equivalent at the same ilevel. Every piece of tier pally gear has +int and +spelldamage which means less +sta or +avoidance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Higher mitigation and survival is what warriors were all about. Warriors suck at aoe tanking while paladins shine at it. People didn't understand that and think that paladins should be exactly the same as a warrior, but with the plus of powerfull aoe tanking abilities (and get pissed that blizzard gave a ghetto aoe 51-talent skill for prot warriors).<br />
<br />
Yea, pallies shine at group trash tanking, something that isn't required. Nihilum doesn't use one (or didn't), even for Hyjal. Try going every 25man raid start-to-finish without a single warrior - it's not possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Spellpower remains the same for paladins and strengh was a useless stat for them, now they'll be able to use it to increase even more their spellpower...<br />
<br />
In wrath, no pally tanks will have +SD on gear...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(all that while paladins get damage buffs from spellpower in their spells that they didn't had or were small buffs),<br />
<br />
Pretty much all pally skills will now scale on +AP. The 51-point talent even scales based just on weapon physical damage...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
while for warriors, strengh was, is and will still be a powerfull stat, that we'll only have (back) in wotlk, and you'll not get a &quot;%str to crit chance or increased threat for each ability&quot; like paladins will get for spellpower (remember, holy damage bypass mitigation, while damage from str not).<br />
<br />
+Str will be tankadin's most important threat stat in Wrath as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And please, I think that every warrior would choose the 4 min/50% shield wall instead of 30min/75% one. (and lol, last stand will never surpass a shield wall utility, lol and pallies have LoH, wich is powerfull now in wotlk with 20min CD and not draining all mana).<br />
<br />
So, pally has low-cd weak SW, warrior has high-cd strong SW.<br />
<br />
Pally has long-cd expensive Last Stand, warrior has short-cd cheap Last Stand.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can only proc free insta-slam if you actually use one, if you loose threat, you loose rage, without rage, no slam, no free slams (and remember, talented and only 2% chance of that happening). Blizzard says that prot warriors will gain rage even without getting hit by the mob, but... yet to be seen.<br />
<br />
Well, sure, but why would you *not* use shield slam? O_o It's a ton of threat, you should be smashing it.<br />
<br />
Free rage on dodges, parries, blocks, more rage from all that +Str causing more damage...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Only in WotLK? Do you play WoW since the prot paladin revamp in 2.0 or stopped before 2.0 and trying again when wotlk launches? Currently, Paladins ARE the 1st tank choice in TBC, be it 5-man/heroic, 10-man raid or 25-man raid.<br />
<br />
Uh. What? Everyone can do 5-mans and 10-mans, they're jokes. So what if pallies can do them a 30s faster because of consecrate O_o...<br />
<br />
25mans is and always has been warrior, warrior, warrior. Warriors have more mitigation, more hp, more emergency buttons, more boss threat....better, better, better. In Sunwell tankadins REALLY hurt for threat. That's why Nihilum and smart guilds LOL@tankadins.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins have blessings (and for now, BoS!) where warriors can only shout one buff for the entire party (and only 2 mins wasting a much needed rage for threat skills). Wanna Kings/Salv of battle shout? lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
No more Salv in WotLK, btw.<br />
<br />
Blessings are nice, but hardly required. And for tanking, if I had to pick one or the other... I would probably prefer Commanding Shout over Kings in most situations, tbh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2008-08-01, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I play both warrior and paladin and looking at tanking objectively the paladin is certainly looking much more desirable so far in WotLK. However it is early days yet and I am sure this will change again.<br />
<br />
Looking at mitigation, you take away shield block and it is an 8-9% increase in melee damage taken for warriors. That is a huge amount of mitigation to lose. With critical block this could be reversed if the lvl 80 tank gear has lots of block rating. Once 75% of the attacks that hit the warrior are blocked he will have more mitigation than the paladin. With present gear at a combined 50% miss + dodge + parry that would mean the warrior would have to have enough block rating for 37.5% unmodified block chance. If block rating is on lvl 80 gear about as much as it is on current gear that is not an unreasonable amount to achieve.<br />
<br />
As for shield wall vs divine shield the first thing to mention is that ardent defender already gives a large damage reduction everytime the paladin drops to low health. The lack of a shield wall for tha paladin was addressed already by this talent. Combine that with the changes do Divine Shield and a paladins mitigation increase by 65% when he is on low health with an ability you can spam twice every boss fight. This is, to put it mildly, incredibly good. It is basically two shield walls per boss fight. Who cares if it is only 50% reduced when the paladin has a ton of health, it is 65% whenever the paladin is close to death which is exactly when you want high mitigation. The fact that it is spammable also makes a huge difference. The primary use of shield wall is as a safety valve at the end of close fights. Boss health drops to 10% with a couple of people dead and you can use it to make it more likely to get past, the paladin doesn't even have to think before using Divine Shield in those situations, if you wipe you have it ready again for the next try anyway. Combine with also having Lay on Hands on its new shorter cooldown and you have a paladin who can soak a huge amount of damage without needing a heal.<br />
<br />
Looking at threat and the paladin also seems to be getting buffed hugely compared to the warrior. Upgrading 1/10th of your devastates to free shield slams isn't going to make a huge difference to warrior threat generation. Yeah it will be nice in low rage situations which basically means farm content so who cares? Contrast with the paladin getting two high threat, high damage moves to use in the existing gaps in their rotation and there is no comparison. Protection paladins already do fairly substantial damage on aoe pulls. <br />
<br />
Looking at buffs. the warrior gives 2225 health to the raid vs the 1800 armor, 3% increased healing and 10% to all stats the paladin will give.<br />
<br />
From a paladin standpoint the new changes are great. You get lots of new abilities and certainly looks like the paladin will be the new number one tank. <br />
<br />
From a warrior standpoint it looks like blizzard are just taking all the cool warrior abilities and giving paladins better versions of them. Better shield wall, better shield slam. In return you get a novelty aoe threat abilty. What I do really like about the warrior changes though is that Blizzard seem to be aware what it is that makes warrior tanking fun and are expanding on it. The cool thing about warrior tanking is that it is hectic, the best rotation changes every couple of seconds based on how much rage you have etc, now it changes even more with procs on free shield slams, and many abilities getting interesting side affects etc so I think I will still find the dynamic rotation of warrior tanking a lot more fun than the fixed rotation that paladin tanking has.<br />
<br />
On the other hand I don't think it would take a huge amount to redeem warrior. For a start shield spec could be buffed to add 3% shield block per talent point instead of the 1% it is now (15% at 5/5). This would help make up for some of the mitigation lost by the shield block change and also synergise well with the critical block talent. Giving Improved Shield Block a 1/2 charge increase also wouldnt hurt. In fact that would be better than the cooldown reduction it has now. Being able to get 3 big blocks every 30 seconds is far more useful than being able to get 1 big block every 20 seconds. Making shield block also give a nice chunk of rage when you block would be nice, 10-15 rage when the charge is used up. 1 charge is just too unreliable, even if you use it at a good time it is just too likely to be sucked up by a normal melee attack.<br />
<br />
After that the only real issue is threat, which the paladin talents seem far better for. However that is relatively easy for Blizzard to fix just by messing about with coefficients so I don't see that being an issue beyond beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As pointed out, paladins seem to be receiving many abilities to complete their tanking package. Firstly, about single target threat, they receive a shield slam analog, Shield of Righteousness. It causes 200% of Shield Block Value as Holy damage.<br />
<br />
Therefore, Shield of Righteousness, after application of the 190% RF modifier, 115% from Shield of the Templar and 130% from Shield Spec, scales at 596.5% of Block Value. In contrast, Shield Slam causes 756-794 damage plus 100% from SBV. After application of a 25% armor mitigation penalty(being generous with full sunders and perhaps Feral Faerie Fire), 145% Def Stance threat mod, and 130% from Shield Spec, the threat equation works out to 1.595(InnateThreat+775X0.75) + 1.706(ShieldBlockValue).<br />
<br />
EDIT: ninja included 1h spec and Imp Shield Bash and Shield of the Templar<br />
<br />
For Shield of Righteousness to equal Shield Slam, therefore, 1.595(InnateThreat+581)=4.259SBV<br />
<br />
and hence:<br />
<br />
InnateThreat + 581 = 2.67SBV<br />
<br />
Rank 6 InnateThreat is 307. Using some handwaving, let's assume Rank 8 gives 500 InnateThreat. The equivalence point would be 404.9 SBV (less conservatively, 600 InnateThreat for Rank 8 yields 442.3) before all modifiers. (I'm going to leave paladin Divine Strength vs Vitality out for the moment) Bulwark of Azzinoth has 174 SBV. I'll further handwave to give Level 80 tanking shields 200 SBV. Hence, there needs to be 204.9 SBV through strength. For Paladins, about 356.3 strength is required to equal Shield Slam. From the previews of tanking rings:<br />
<br />
http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=35661<br />
<br />
I don't think 356.3 strength will be difficult to reach at all. Blessing of Kings is ignored because it's an external buff. From that point of 404.9 SBV (or 442.3 conservatively), Shield of Righteousness starts to outscale Shield Slam extremely rapidly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hammer of the Righteous is much more in line, and is very debatably in need of a buff. It deals 100% weapon damage as Holy Damage. Therefore, the threat scaling is at 199.5% of (WeaponDamage + AP contribution). Devastate, after considering relevant talents and armor, deals 50% weapon damage plus 315 at 5 Sunder stacks, and therefore scales at 0.598(WeaponDamage + AP contribution) + 236.25 + 1.45(InnateThreat). Devastate Rank 3 has 176 Innate Threat, so I'm going to handwave Rank 5 to approx. 350 InnateThreat.<br />
<br />
Rank 5 Devastate would therefore look like 0.598(WeaponDamage + AP contribution) + 743.75. Solving for equivalence point, we get:<br />
<br />
WeaponDamage + AP contribution = 532.4<br />
<br />
This means, when your weapon damage is 532.4, Hammer of the Righteous produces threat equal to Devastate. Less and Dev wins out, more and HotR wins out. There's still the 6sec cooldown and 3 targets vs spammable and refreshes Sunder.<br />
<br />
<br />
From a purely subjective point of view, paladin emergency buttons have been heavily improved. 4min Divine Protection, 20min LoH and always on Ardent Defender vs 6min Last Stand and 30 min Shield Wall. Leapfrogging AD is not considered, because something that can leapfrog 35% of the paladin's HP can very well leapfrog the 30% granted by Last Stand.<br />
<br />
Again, from a purely subjective PoV, paladins remain by far the strongest AoE tank, while warriors have been given AoE threat sufficient to hold against healing. I don't think Bloodbath, Tclap and Shockwave can hold against any sort of serious AoE, but I have not been in beta. I hear that Shockwave aiming sucks, but here's hope that it will be changed.<br />
<br />
Assumptions used in the calculations:<br />
<br />
Innate Threat was roughly doubled from the 70 versions, as Devastate's bonus damage also roughly doubled and from various sources regarding theorycrafted 80 DPS numbers.<br />
<br />
Native SBV of 200 on Shields at 80, derived from 174 on Bulwark of Azzinoth.<br />
<br />
Disclosure: I play a warrior tank, but not a paladin tank. I would welcome civil corrections/critique to the above calculations and assumptions.<br />

Eh, hunters got smoked by the pot changes, don't knock them. With crap for regen, zero spirit bonuses, the JoW nerf, and the need to take a rather severe DPS hit (Hawk adds RAP and more importantly, chance to proc Imp AotH) to use their built in regen mechanics, they might not be in as good a shape as you think.

Hammer of the Righteous is much more in line, and is very debatably in need of a buff. It deals 100% weapon damage as Holy Damage. Therefore, the threat scaling is at 199.5% of (WeaponDamage + AP contribution). Devastate, after considering relevant talents and armor, deals 50% weapon damage plus 315 at 5 Sunder stacks, and therefore scales at 0.598(WeaponDamage + AP contribution) + 236.25 + 1.45(InnateThreat). Devastate Rank 3 has 176 Innate Threat, so I'm going to handwave Rank 5 to approx. 350 InnateThreat.<br />
<br />
Rank 5 Devastate would therefore look like 0.598(WeaponDamage + AP contribution) + 743.75. Solving for equivalence point, we get:<br />
<br />
WeaponDamage + AP contribution = 532.4<br />
<br />
This means, when your weapon damage is 532.4, Hammer of the Righteous produces threat equal to Devastate. Less and Dev wins out, more and HotR wins out. There's still the 6sec cooldown and 3 targets vs spammable and refreshes Sunder.<br />
<br />
<br />
From a purely subjective point of view, paladin emergency buttons have been heavily improved. 4min Divine Protection, 20min LoH and always on Ardent Defender vs 6min Last Stand and 30 min Shield Wall. Leapfrogging AD is not considered, because something that can leapfrog 35% of the paladin's HP can very well leapfrog the 30% granted by Last Stand.<br />
<br />
Again, from a purely subjective PoV, paladins remain by far the strongest AoE tank, while warriors have been given AoE threat sufficient to hold against healing. I don't think Bloodbath, Tclap and Shockwave can hold against any sort of serious AoE, but I have not been in beta. I hear that Shockwave aiming sucks, but here's hope that it will be changed.<br />
<br />
Assumptions used in the calculations:<br />
<br />
Innate Threat was roughly doubled from the 70 versions, as Devastate's bonus damage also roughly doubled and from various sources regarding theorycrafted 80 DPS numbers.<br />
<br />
Native SBV of 200 on Shields at 80, derived from 174 on Bulwark of Azzinoth.<br />
<br />
Disclosure: I play a warrior tank, but not a paladin tank. I would welcome civil corrections/critique to the above calculations and assumptions.<br />
<br />
<br />
While I am sure your maths are all correct the point you are missing is that Shield of Righteousness and Hammer of the Righteous are both new abilities that a paladin can squeeze into an existing rotation, a rotation that already pretty much equals a warriors threat generation. Since seals are now 2 minute duration the paladin has one extra gcd freed up from their existing rotation.<br />
<br />
So a paladin while tanking can use many new, high threat abilities without having to give up any of their existing threat generation while the warrior only gets a slight increase on some existing abilities. A warrior tanking is already using every single global cooldown, a paladin is not even close to doing that.<br />
<br />
Even if Shield Slam and Shield of Righteousness caused the same threat what matters is that Paladins can squeeze the new attack into their rotation while warriors still will be using the same rotation as before. Paladins gain the extra threat, warriors gain nothing. To balance that they would have to double the amount of threat shield slam causes and then both classes would gain 1 shield slam worth of threat every 6 seconds.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I agree that the GCD issue is significant. A minor correction, while resealing is no longer needed, Judgement now takes a GCD, so no change in that regard. A lot depends on how the other paladin abilities scale. The standard rotation now is SS/Rev/Dev/Dev. Revenge doesn't scale, while it's the cheapest and most efficient (you're not beating a 2 rage ability on efficiency...), it will be dropped from a high TPS/high rage rotation. Incite will help a little, but the rage cost limits its effectiveness.<br />
<br />
My math was primarily to show that a combination of Holy Damage (bypasses armor) and a built in threat mod of 190% vs 145% creates funny scaling. Using static components to balance against scaling abilities makes one class clearly gimped at one gear level, but ridiculously OP at another.<br />
<br />
Still, I view the biggest challenge at the moment to be better AoE tanking (read: 360% shockwave with a slightly better coefficient). Warriors should be able to handle low-threat/careful AoE, while leaving the all-out Seed spam to the paladins.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ateve</div><div class="date">2008-08-01, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Therefore, Shield of Righteousness, after application of the 190% RF modifier, 115% from Shield of the Templar and 130% from Shield Spec, scales at 596.5% of Block Value. In contrast, Shield Slam causes 756-794 damage plus 100% from SBV. After application of a 25% armor mitigation penalty(being generous with full sunders and perhaps Feral Faerie Fire), 145% Def Stance threat mod, and 130% from Shield Spec, the threat equation works out to 1.595(InnateThreat+775X0.75) + 1.706(ShieldBlockValue).<br />
<br />
<br />
Small problem with your numbers, Shield Spec &quot;Increases the amount of damage absorbed by your shield by 30%&quot;, it does not increase your SBV by 30%, so it should not effect the amount of dmg (and therefore threat) of Shield of Righteousness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I am also playing AoC at the moment and following WoW news... as well as AoC news, Darkfall, Huxley, Warhammer and a number of other games - what does your statement prove? :)<br />
It's just fun to see which direction the developers take different games as well as seeing what's new in those games.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft is not a relationship, you don't have to &quot;break up&quot; and never come back to it or never hold any interest in it again - it's a game.</div></div><hr />

Shield Mastery for warriors is also worded exactly the same way and it affects Shield Slam.</div></div><hr />

Got this from a source in blizz US. Apparently, they will release this early since there are heaps of active beta players and consistent info from them. and most of all, they will have to adjust it eventually when it goes live so might as well release it early this year!</div></div><hr />

they didn't even work on rogues, death knight balancing is not completed, professions are not completed..<br />
<br />
you got it wrong dude, september 23. is the date when warhammer online sets sail for fail.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dareos</div><div class="date">2008-08-19, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even if they have heaps of active beta players, you can only fix so much bugs and only implement so much features as you have developers. And I've yet to see a Blizzard game released earlier then expected. From my experience, Blizzard doesn't give half-baked cookies to their customers, even if they could just add some chocolate later on.<br />
<br />
My prediction is that Blizzard will announce the release date of wrath on the blizzcon opening ceremony. Now that we'll see the cinematic in leipzig there isn't really a lot more to announce than a %#@&amp;% release-date!</div></div><hr />
