The latest Legion build reduced the amount you can zoom out with the camera. <br />

<br />
This is one of this changes that we realize will be intensely unpopular with the group of players that has used console/WTF CVars to increase camera zoom beyond what the UI slider permits. For everyone else, they probably won't see what the big deal is, since it's removing a hidden option that most never used. But for those who are accustomed to an increased max zoom, it's changing the way you're experiencing the game in a way that feels restrictive and simply worse. So why would we do that?<br />
<br />
In a broad range of gaming genres (from RTS to Action RPG), being able to zoom out and see more of the world around you provides an objective advantage in the form of information. Due to that competitive advantage, camera-unlocking or increased zoom distance are features commonly found in third-party hacks for a variety of games. Whatever the maximum allowed, that's what competitive players will use in order to maximize performance, even at the expense of the game's overall look and feel. <br />
<br />
We strongly believe that there needs to be parity in this area between players who are using the default UI and those who have addons or knowledge of hidden console variables. One option was certainly to just allow the in-game slider to go all the way up to the CVar hardcap. But that scale is beyond the one around which the game was designed at its core. The development team builds the world, its art, its combat mechanics, and other interactions, around the base UI experience and scale. At the 3.4-CVar zoom level, your heroic Warcraft avatar takes up about as much screen-space as one of the dozens of marines you might control in a game of Starcraft.<br />
<br />
Basically all of us started out playing WoW at the UI-enabled zoom level, and fell in love with that world enough that we now find ourselves here posting on an expansion beta forum discussing its future. At some point, we saw a raid video and wondered how they could see so much of the field at once, or we saw a forum post or got a helpful tip from another player, and learned that if you typed &quot;/console CameraDistanceMaxFactor 4&quot; you could zoom out way more, and we never looked back. But was that original experience bad, or have we just grown accustomed to something different?<br />
<br />
There may also be a bit of hyperbole in the discussion around the change. This is a screenshot I just took with the max UI-selectable zoom settings in the current Legion build: http://i.imgur.com/e8vFT6t.jpg <br />
<br />
I'm not sure it's fair to say that this level of zoom entails your character dominating the screen, or removes any awareness of nearby threats.<br />
<br />
Finally, why did this happen suddenly now, late in the beta cycle, seemingly without any communication? Honestly, the intent was for the change to have been in place from early alpha onwards. I believe that what happened was that one of the CVars (CameraDistanceMaxFactor?) was clamped from the start, but a second CVar (CameraDistanceMax?) was overlooked. That issue was entered and tracked as a bug, and was just fixed recently. As a development team, at this point we're fixing up to 2000 Legion bugs a week, and it's not always obvious which player-facing build will contain a particular one of those fixes. This clearly wasn't something we ever imagined could just be swept under the carpet.</div></div><hr />

It's to make the game more immersive and to give stuff size again. This goes along to help make the action cam better for those who will use it. They have made this great expansive game and for people to be zoomed out to the point where there character is a mere pixel on the screen seems a bit dumb, doesn't it?</div></div><hr />

Why they keep forcing those horrible close cameras in all of their games. It's not funny anymore.</div></div><hr />

You would want to see everything of a mob and not just the legs without being forced to put the camera angled upwards. But other than that I mostly just use it on boss fights to see what everyone else are doing. For me it isn't really an issue that they are removing this since it puts me closer to my character, which is the one I am actually playing. I am not playing the world with a character in it, I am playing the character in a world.</div></div><hr />

Try and tell me all the above when u will play tank in mannoroth. Also try and raid lead as well while enjoying being inside its model seeing absolutelly nothing but a bunch of low polygons.</div></div><hr />

Isn't that up to the user how they enjoy the game? Make it at least available in raids and battlegrounds where the graphics don't matter and you want good overview and good fps.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cathbadh</div><div class="date">2016-06-25, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Annoying decision. I'd be fine with it though if it meant they'd decorate their raid/dungeon maps better. Nothing's worse than having your camera suddenly jammed up your toon's rear because you panned past where a tree or banner or alcove or pillar was. Some level of transparency with scenery and the character would be invaluable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And rightfully so. It's a stupid backwards change. They should have added /console CameraDistanceMaxFactor 4 to be the new max distance with the slider. Not remove something pvp players and raiders are used to for 10 years now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geschan</div><div class="date">2016-06-25, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don`t think that the reduction in camera distance is really that bad of a thing.<br />
Most boss encounters are fought in closed rooms where the camera was limited thanks to the ceiling anyway.<br />
It is still possible to zoom out far enough to watch the whole raid.<br />
<br />
What I personally find astonishing is the amount of hatred and toxicity in the answers to the post.<br />
Are people really believing that attacking watcher and calling him an idiot will make blizzard revert the change?</div></div><hr />

Thought the slider allowed for the max camera distance that you previously needed to change with CVars<br />
<br />
That said, I've always played with my camera all the way zoomed out in raids (at least in Wrath and Cata) because it's objectively better, I hated it aesthetically though. In the end I don't really care, makes bosses look bigger /shrug. It really isn't that big of a deal</div></div><hr />

How about not changing something people have used and never complained about in 10 years? The way to activate it with a console command also makes sure only experienced players will use it and the average player will get his immersive visuals. WHY DO THEY FIX STUFF THAT ISN'T BROKEN?</div></div><hr />

I think this was a perfect case of &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;. This change makes no logical sense. It fucks with some people, and it changes something that people have been used to for years. If someone wants to quit due to a change like this, all power to them.

Yes, up to a point where it's frustrating to just see a mess of low polyons. That's not fun at all. When you tank Mannoroth mythic against the pillar for example. Without a max distance camera it's horrible.</div></div><hr />

Tanks and melee. I could barely stand playing a melee before in some of the smaller boss rooms with limited zoom-out, and now I guess me playing a ranged in Legion (if I play at all) is assured.<br />

Blizzard is designing encounters around players having mods these days. Good luck trying to kill Archimonde Mythic without all the mods for the beams and to hit the right timings. Blizzard knows we got them, so they design around them. Only way to stop it would be to remove mods all together, and then we would just end up with 3rd party programs anyway.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't make the game easier, you're strawmanning hard right now. It makes the game more palatable since you can see more than just the raid bosses ankles.<br />

more like i hate people who complain for the sake of complaining. there's literally no reasoning with them, they just like to complain and see the world burn.<br />
<br />
and yes, it does make the game easier. you literally are able to see more things and gather more information of your surroundings than you normally would. that does make it easier. the same thing happened in overwatch where players were asking for a bigger FoV angle which would enable them to see more things around them and therefore enable for higher awareness with ease and make the game easier.</div></div><hr />

Yes you are, because <br />
<br />
a) Not all players are the same - I for example like the prune since I ran out of easy reachable keybindings already. So some like the prune, others don't. <br />
<br />
b) The camera is not just about &quot;easy&quot; it's about overview (you can manage to play against a mob where you just see a low poly foot, but it's not fun) and also about beauty. The first image shows how much of the scenery you see at the higher viewpoint and how little at the lower camera. For tanks and melees it is also about awareness and fun. Playing in a polygonal chaos isn't fun.</div></div><hr />

Only because the argument is not rational. Not only is it irrational, the variables have been manipulated to lessen the impact of the issue (no UI element in his screenshot).<br />

<br />
Cause with the addon its really easy to deal it even if u play first person all in. Try and do the fight with no addons and default max ui distance and come back and tell me how does it feels. Also this is taken from official forums and i couldnt said it better my self.<br />
<br />
&quot;You make tanking terrible in Legion.<br />
<br />
You've made melee terrible.. well, forever (unless you're a long time raiding rogue). You give us raid bosses that demand three rogues and no other melee. You give us fight after fight where we have to limit our melee core. In a huge display of idiocy, you make another tank and melee class that we definitely didn't need. And you were so lazy about it you didn't even give it a third spec.<br />
<br />
So... we've made melee highly undesirable. You've demanded specific class stacking even outside of the top 5 world kills. You've added a new melee class that just skews numbers and increases bench time (especially with the dumb change from 25 to 20m). Now, you want to make my melee core see even less around them causing them to die more often thus causing the debate on whether we should bring them to a fight.<br />
<br />
Fix this change. I forgive so many changes in this game on the sole reason that the raid designed content is pretty solid. But everything else in this game is just bad. You stopped playing your game a long time ago. And you stopped caring about it even longer. Just listen to the opinions of people that still play it and care for it.<br />
<br />
Some of us still have passion left for this game and want it to improve. Stop changing things and making it worse.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was always a choice, but it had two problems.<br />
The first issue was the lack of accessibility of the full option to most players.<br />
There is in my opinion too much stuff hidden behind CVars.<br />
<br />
The second more subjective one is that the maximum was too much.<br />
Blizzard are addressing both, with the second one being something that it is impossible to please everyone with.<br />

This affects me. I get pretty bad motion sickness and one of the reasons that WoW is something I can play for long periods of time (which is pretty important as a raider) is precisely because the script that allows me to zoom out really far as much as possible.<br />
<br />
I mean, it depends on the distance of the max zoom now and a lot of other factors (environmental shake effects, encounters with walls that push the camera in,etc) and so it may ultimately end up being a nonissue and therefore not something I'm going to get upset about until I've really experienced it, but it still feels like something they could have compromised by making the default ui slider match the script rather than the other way around.</div></div><hr />

Here's the thing though. There is no reason for this camera change, but making smaller enemies and bosses would be a solution to it. HOWEVER, this limits the kind of content Blizzard can make. No more giant, intimidating bosses. No more massive battles where you feel like you and your raid group are facing off against a gigantic beast of a boss. All because of Blizzard's decision to limit view distance? Seems stupid to me.</div></div><hr />

What next? Removing transmog because devs spend so much time making huge and ugly shoulderpads and you can't see them if you transmog them away?<br />
<br />
Overall i don't think it matters much to me, but it's just... stupid. Just another example of a change which may as well have been bug, but with some bullshit talk they will make it sound like intentional.</div></div><hr />

There is no reason for this camera change, but making smaller enemies and bosses would be a solution to it. HOWEVER, this limits the kind of content Blizzard can make. No more giant, intimidating bosses. No more massive battles where you feel like you and your raid group are facing off against a gigantic beast of a boss. All because of Blizzard's decision to limit view distance? Seems a stupid to me.<br />
<br />
It doesn't limit the content they can make, though. They didn't design old big bosses with the idea that everyone was going to be using the console to have a bigger camera distance. This is all kneejerk doomsaying to a minor change. Half the boss rooms in Legion don't even let you use your camera that zoomed out. <br />
<br />
I don't really understand why they made the change but to say this is the end of raiding is delusional.</div></div><hr />

I could barely stand playing a melee before in some of the smaller boss rooms with limited zoom-out, and now I guess me playing a ranged in Legion (if I play at all) is assured.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard is designing encounters around players having mods these days. Good luck trying to kill Archimonde Mythic without all the mods for the beams and to hit the right timings. Blizzard knows we got them, so they design around them. Only way to stop it would be to remove mods all together, and then we would just end up with 3rd party programs anyway.<br />
<br />
All you're proving is that these players aren't as good as they claim they are. If there's some guy who's missing and arm and needs mods to play the game I don't blame him, but the rest of these players are just spineless mooks looking for every crutch they can to one-up people.<br />
<br />
You don't need mods. Only the raid leader has ever felt necessary to use mods to help coordinate players.<br />
<br />
With all the pruning in Legion, you probably won't even need a dps meter. Even now Recount(etc) only exists as a means to point fingers.</div></div><hr />

When you're passionate about something, and want to be the best you can be at something, you're going to take every advantage you can get. If being called a &quot;spineless mook&quot; by someone like you is a result of that then so be it. Mods help. Some more than others. Contrary to popular belief, Recount can show the raid leader why the raid is wiping repeatedly on a boss (damage taken by spell is one I use a lot). The people who say they're hardcore and don't use any form of addon are gimping themselves, especially when we have something like Curse that makes installing addons take literally 2 seconds. I feel like the &quot;pointing fingers&quot; comment means something's wrong with the person using the addon, rather than the addon itself.</div></div><hr />

Seriously fucking tired of players demanding you install mods or download third-party shit anyway.<br />

This is exactly what they should do. If they want an even playing field disable all third-party addons because that gives other players advantage way more then in-game visuals themselves. Blizz is failing hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Archimonde is that large. He is considerably taller than other draenei, and has been since we saw him in Warcraft 3. The issue is that, because he is humanoid, his model stretches up instead of across. So you only end up seeing his ass + legs as a melee, instead of his whole model. Some other huge models, like the Iron Juggernaut, fit on the screen because their models stretch horizontally. <br />
<br />
This is a case of them making their bed and now they must lie in it. Most of the shit the Legion has to throw at us are very tall humanoids, so I'd be expecting a lot of demon ass this expansion.</div></div><hr />

Just make the default option further away, don't take away options. Playing a Tauren or NE - something with a larger body model - makes a significant difference in what you see and how quickly you react in a raid environment. Any environment, honestly. And god forbid you be melee. <br />

At some point, we saw a raid video and wondered how they could see so much of the field at once, or we saw a forum post or got a helpful tip from another player, and learned that if you typed &quot;/console CameraDistanceMaxFactor 4&quot; you could zoom out way more, and we never looked back. But was that original experience bad, or have we just grown accustomed to something different?<br />
<br />
A lot of people touched on this already but I wanted to throw in my opinion. this is clearly just a terrible arguement, that is like saying I am used to playing with 10-12 fps because thats what I had when I first found WoW so I should be limited to that.<br />
<br />
This is a pretty stark contrast to their stance on vanilla servers aswell (not saying I want vanilla servers) they make the point that they don't want people to go backwards etc etc and they say hey lets go back to how you first had it. I also had base UI and no addons, they are not pushing to disable addons/ui changes like bigwigs/dbm/skada/omen/elvui list goes on which a player DOES NOT initially have upon enjoying the game but will find it if they feel they need to, this is not different and why they think it's ok is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

It's a fair enough point. I know that raiding is represented here more greatly than what is in the game. I also know that there are many who can't wait to jump into something new so they can yet again express their dislike for Blizzard and all they do. Nothing to be done about that but it skews things greatly on occasion.<br />

The change will be very likely a great inconvenience for raiders and probably mythic+ devotees. I'm not entirely on board with the change but I'm less on board with hyperbole (&quot;punishment&quot;) and assumptions that this somehow affects a lot of people. I think a lot of people know about the website's existence. How many of them are going to the trouble to use console commands is another matter.</div></div><hr />

Im also no sure how it &quot;provides an objective advantage&quot; when anyone can use the console command. Either people know and don't use it or they don't know at all and can easily ask or look it up.

The only reason to keep it the old way is so lazy players can see the whole raid room all at once. so yes this is dumb for both pvp and pve you shouldn't be able to see the whole bg map or the whole raid room. AND stop comparing this to addon's having WA tell you about your buffs isn't the same as seeing the whole raid room and not having to turn around to see whats happening and where. All blizzard had to say is you should have to look around in a raid fight sitting half afk in a mythic fight isnt what our goal for raids was. oh and im 13/13m and i watch simpsons while we raid manny and archy each week you dont need to see how many clouds are above manny.

The addons I use have literally nothing to do with the camera distance, there is not a single boss in HFC or any other raid where you need extra camera zoom to see everything you need to see.<br />

Your comment makes me facepalm. The maximum camera distance the default UI allows (by setting the slider to far) is absolutely plenty for raiding.

I'd probably prefer they just increased the UI-allowed distance to match the console command-allowed distance, rather than trimming anything above the UI-allowed limit, though. WoW's got a great world and seeing more of it is never a bad thing. Also I'm just getting a new computer built to provide better graphics than I currently have so I'm a little disappointed in that sense, too...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This change is fine, although their reasoning is pretty bad. I've played ranged, tank and melee in progression raiding and I use the console command infrequently, but when I do use it there is great purpose behind it. As a tank, it's incredibly dull to watch a massively oversized boss model (i.e. Mannoroth, Heroic Ragnaros) for the entire duration of the fight. It's not only that I'm seeing 40% of the boss on my screen, it's that the model blocks view of everything else happening in the room. Additionally, picking up adds during fights can be impaired with large models, as you can't really click on anything other than what's 2 feet in front of your character. Yes, nameplates help, but sometimes you want to have the add targeted beforehand, when it's out of range for the nameplate to show up. Even then, clicking a nameplate versus an actual model is slightly more difficult. Not saying impossible, but it was nice to be able to clear some screen clutter and keep things organized.<br />
<br />
As a melee, it's less of an issue but it can still be obnoxious. Again I would reference the nameplate issue. With how unreliable tab targetting can be if there are more than 2 enemies, I often opt to click the new target (since I don't click my spells, inb4 &quot;omg elitist with ur keybindz thats unfair to people who dont have keyboards&quot;).<br />
<br />
The least affected is ranged/healing, however in certain cases you are required to stack with or near the melee or tank group(s) for mechanics and it's still nice to be able to zoom out more.<br />
<br />
Is it a dumb change? Yes, but it's dumb because of their reasoning. Is it gamebreaking? No. People who are saying it is for those with epilepsy or photosensitivity should just opt to turn down graphics. This game can run on a toaster, so low settings are more than sufficient to keep you from seizing mid session.<br />
<br />
Max camera distance should have been on the slider since the beginning. Now it is. It isn't as far as it could be, but at least it's not &quot;hidden&quot; behind a script anymore. It'll be playable obviously, but I do hope there aren't any Mannoroths or Rags in raiding or it will be slightly less enjoyable for no apparent reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So.. you took this beta change and actually applied in RL? This attitude is so narrow sighted as new MCD settings.<br />
How is it considered a &quot;cheat&quot; something is put in by blizz devs a long time ago and its in the game?<br />
I know what you want to say, but the tone in which youre saying it is soo bad and irritating. I really dont see the point in calling someone names arrogantly simply because hes using settings that you dont, settings that are there for a long time and for everyone to use them, implemented by blizzard.<br />
<br />
Back on topic. The change is simply stupid on a global scale. Why they dont implement it just for PvP?<br />
I see what they want to accomplish with it, specially in competitive PvP, but with all the new systems in the game which are splitting PvP from PvE more and more, with new version of PvP system im pretty much sure that they have the tech to make this PvP only change.<br />
<br />
I simply fail to see the reason for game wide MCD reduction in PvE too. They are talking about the &quot;scaling and proportional feel?&quot; Sure, i bet that fully size buffed tauren on mamoth that is tall as Org entrance feels really scaled well. And proportional too.<br />
<br />
Next point, main one, simply because its health related. I, for once, suffer of motion sickness with reduced FoV in games. Im unable to play games like D3 and HoTS longer than an hour-hour and a half before i need to make a break or my motion sickness due to low FoV would kick in and ill get insane headache and be all sickly. In extreme cases i would trow up and.. end up in bed. By the looking at new screenshoots in full-screen for a minute or two i could clearly see that ill have issues with new camera settings cause those shots made me all sickly and feeling quite uncomfortable. Now i bet that my guild, or anyone else in the raid for that matter, will be quite ok when i say in the middle of the raid &quot;Guys, could you wait for 20ish minutes, my Motion sickness is kicking in? Love ya! &lt;3&quot; Yup. quite ok with it.<br />
<br />
WoW is a game which im playing since Vanilla and i used CVar commands to set the camera, mainly to avoid Motion sickness but also to my likings.<br />
Its a rare MMO game that im actually enjoying playing and i can play it for a bit longer time frame than usual, if this change would affect only PvP i couldnt care less, but as it has somewhat major impact on game globally and game modes (PvE) that i play and limits my performance due to Motion sickness with reduced FoV im not ok with it. As i said, i do see what they want to do with it, my question is - why not make it just PvP change if you strive towards that &quot;equal chance for a victory&quot; mentality?</div></div><hr />

Behold the Blizz shill, folks.<br />
<br />
How bout, in what universe does it make sense to dramatically increase the distance we can see and trumpet it as a feature, then neuter an existing zoom that's been fine, well-known (you really think people have been too stupid to search &quot;zoom out more in wow&quot;?), and makes the game much more enjoyable for every role?<br />
<br />
Also, how the hell is it cheating when it's built into the engine? Watcher put out a load of crap there, no one was modifying game files, running third-party anything, just tweaking a setting that's been present for a decade.</div></div><hr />

If you were raiding and didn't, it was a disadvantage. YIt definitely helped being able to get a wider view during boss fights for sure. You could get by without it sure, just like you can get by without a lot of other things like enchants or pre-potting. But it was used by most raiders. If you only did pvp, questing, or maybe lfr, you probably wouldn't have used it.<br />
<br />
My larger concern with the change is that I've noticed the camera is often zooming in close on it's own by default now. I don't need max zoom necessarily, we can survive with it toned down a bit even if it's not my preference. But don't have it zoom in by default close on it's own to where I'm constantly having to re-back up my view. At least it seems like it's that behavior on beta a lot right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True... *shrug* I don't zoom out significantly further than that most of the time anyways, but I do know that the times I do, it's because it's because I need to see what's actually going on around me. <br />
<br />
If I had any confidence that they'll design raids and dungeons around this new limitation, I'd be more ok with it... but they're implying they already did so, when there are definitely times you can't see anything unless you go beyond what the system would normally let you do. Like, for instance, as Kynlee said, if you're tanking or in melee and have a giant mob dominating the majority of your screen.</div></div><hr />

There is nothing in their justification for this change that really justifies the reason for it, they've decided to make the change for some reason they are not willing to say. Maybe it's for the facebook streaming stuff, maybe it's for some sort of e-sport spectator mode coming who knows but the reason he is giving is clearly rubbish. Just like their &quot;lore&quot; justification for karabor not being a home city, or &quot;maybe Ashran is Farahlon&quot;. <br />
<br />
As other people have stated in this thread, if their justification is competitive advantage then they should remove every addon that the general casual playerbase don't use that is giving people an advantage over them. Blizzard have clearly lost the plot at this point and they believe the playerbase is stupid, gullible and will buy any rubbish or lies they are fed.</div></div><hr />

Yup, also all screen comparisons that they took are uphill with huge chunks of terrain/NPC to fill the screen and lessen actual view distance difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
True... *shrug* I don't zoom out significantly further than that most of the time anyways, but I do know that the times I do, it's because it's because I need to see what's actually going on around me. <br />
<br />
If I had any confidence that they'll design raids and dungeons around this new limitation, I'd be more ok with it... but they're implying they already did so, when there are definitely times you can't see anything unless you go beyond what the system would normally let you do. Like, for instance, as Kynlee said, if you're tanking or in melee and have a giant mob dominating the majority of your screen.<br />
<br />
They also advertised aerial and mounted combat as major features of WoTLK, yet here we are. and new dances too. :D<br />
Well, lets hope that camera wont be that &quot;smart&quot; as the people in beta are reporting and be more smart and stay as we set it.</div></div><hr />

Not gonna lie; I reflexively tried to zoom out when I went down to the second picture because it's super freaking noticeable. If what people are saying is true, view distance has decreased from 50 yards to 42.5 - so a radius of 15%. which happens to cut out *a lot*.</div></div><hr />

more like i hate people who complain for the sake of complaining. there's literally no reasoning with them, they just like to complain and see the world burn.<br />
You even thinking that proves that you have no idea what you are talking about, you are literally disreguarding other peoples opinions because you disagree with them, you aren't allowed to do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and yes, it does make the game easier. you literally are able to see more things and gather more information of your surroundings than you normally would. that does make it easier. the same thing happened in overwatch where players were asking for a bigger FoV angle which would enable them to see more things around them and therefore enable for higher awareness with ease and make the game easier.<br />
<br />
So does DBM is that being removed? No? Good call.</div></div><hr />

Most boss encounters are fought in closed rooms where the camera was limited thanks to the ceiling anyway.<br />
It is still possible to zoom out far enough to watch the whole raid.<br />
<br />
What I personally find astonishing is the amount of hatred and toxicity in the answers to the post.<br />
Are people really believing that attacking watcher and calling him an idiot will make blizzard revert the change?<br />
<br />
In HFC, the number of bosses fought in a very small room - 3. Tyrant, socrethar, and Gorefiend(stomache)<br />
<br />
In Highmaul, the number of bosses fought in a very small room - none.<br />
<br />
BRF had more of this, but the rooms were still large, and generally not limited by the max view distance. Blackhand phase 2 was a slight pain, but not really.<br />
<br />
As we go back in expansions, the number of bosses fought either outside, or in extremely large rooms that exceeds the range of max camera view distance FAR outnumbers the ones who are fought in smaller, cramped rooms. Hell, I can't even think of any who are fought in extremely tight rooms. Even dungeon bosses tend to have plenty of space to easily see the entirety of the boss fighting area.<br />
<br />
Even in Legion, most bosses are fought in nice wide-open spaces.<br />
<br />
If this is implemented, it may just cost Blizzard my subscription. Because fuck them trying to forcefeed us everything little !@#$ing thing. Not only is it inconvenient, its downright insulting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most likely would, but I don't have Beta installed, and it'll take me hours to do so as I've got no space for an extra copy of WoW on my SSD, so it'd need to be on my normal HD. Found a few more comparisons though; <br />
<br />
Here's some guy testing his standard 1920x1080 monitor versus a beefed up 3440x1440 - seems like you can *buy* view distance to get an advantage, if it becomes a major issue, so no worries:<br />
http://i.imgur.com/sQVcynC.jpg<br />
<br />
And here's a brave person testing out Mannoroth with the new zoom-level in LFR, direct quote from the US forums:<br />
<br />
<br />
Courtasy of Lorentz a video of what LFR Mannoroth looks like using the new Legion camera distance.<br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-5CzOtXC_Q<br />
<br />
A couple times that show the problems with the new tighter camera.<br />
6:20--Shadowforce blinds the player:<br />
https://youtu.be/j-5CzOtXC_Q?t=377<br />
<br />
7:42--Big green explosion blinds the player<br />
https://youtu.be/j-5CzOtXC_Q?t=462<br />
<br />
8:18--Wings cover up most of the screen<br />
https://youtu.be/j-5CzOtXC_Q?t=498<br />
<br />
Beyond these somewaht extreme examples in general Mannoroth is covering 30-50% of the screen and in a lot of tanking configurations this blocks the view of most of the player's platform. If you needed to keep an eye out on abilities or mechanics on the opposite side the new camera angle would make that very difficult.<br />
<br />
Lastly, it turns out that it's actually sort of easy to get our old options back - it's just a much bigger hassle. Here's someone explaining how to manually change the settings in order to work around this new change:<br />
<br />
<br />
As a temporary work around (with some limitations and issues) you can open your config-cache.wtf for the specific character (so World of Warcraft/WTF/Account/[Account Name]/[Realm Name]/[Character Name]/config-cache.wtf) while you are not logged into the character and change<br />
<br />
SET cameraSavedDistance &quot;28.500000&quot;<br />
to<br />
SET cameraSavedDistance &quot;50.000000&quot;<br />
<br />
This will give you a camera zoomed out as far as the maximum in prior builds and on live. Unfortunately, anything that changes the zoom (even a mousewheel down) will cause the camera to zoom in to the 28.5 value. You can sort of get around this by binding keys to save and set a view (save when you log in, set to recall the 50 distance if something causes it to change). However, this view isn't saved through a logout and neither is the 50 value in the config-cache.wtf, meaning you'll have to repeat this process every time you log in (which is probably often with how unstable servers have been lately).<br />
<br />
<br />
Which means that:<br />
<br />
1: Anyone that cares about this enough to want to use it will have a script file they can hit to manually change the config-cache file to replace the 28.50000 value with the 50.00000 one - which is good, I might have to hack the game slightly (buuuut considering how half my guild uses Tmorph and they haven't been banned yet, I'm not deadly afraid of resorting to that if they're being this stupid about it), but atleast I can retain my viewdistance with a minor inconvenience of double clicking another button before I open WoW every time I log on. <br />
<br />
2: Blizzard has effectively managed to remove my option to zoom in and out; I'm going to have to disable my zoom function so I don't hit it by accident, and reset my viewdistance. They wanted me to see more of the world? How about fucking forcing me to play zoomed out ALL THE TIME, MOTHER FUCKERS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's all too obvious Blizzard are doing these changes in order to set the game up for consoles, &amp; I'm suprised I haven't seen more convo about it over the forums in recent years. They've lost over 40% of their player base in one expansion alone, of course they're trying to take measures to make an extra buck, it's business right. lol The thing that will be interesting to see come Legion, &amp; this is evident from WOD alone, is that the WOW community ain't all sheep. They will express themselves &amp; shun the game if Blizzard annoys them enough with silly changes, &amp; this is a silly change to say the least!

I understand too many abilities or flying affect game in bad way, but zoom? Zoom is harmless.<br />
<br />
We are long past stone age when 1024x768 was amazingly high resolution. Today's displays are more than twice bigger than that. I'm playing on iMac 27 at 2560x1440, when zoomed in to default levels everything becomes huge and I can easily see ugliness of low resolution textures. Zooming out makes world more beautiful. I can only imagine how 5k display owners will feel about this change.</div></div><hr />

Totally could if I knew how to affect the changes properly on live. I've literally only got two zoom options no matter how I combine the commands - the super-zoomed in (which isn't the right one because it got buffed slightly on the PTR) and the max distance one, and nothing between, despite setting these options:<br />
<br />
cameraDistanceMaxFactor to 1.9<br />
cameraSavedDistance to 28.5<br />

how about giving the fuckin option to play however i like? Why would i have to deal with this shit because someone somewhere decided that they don't like how much the camara zooms out?

No, in a game that has competitive aspects, you will not be allowed to play &quot;however you like&quot;. It's something you should have understood by now.</div></div><hr />

Changing max camera is devs deciding how their game should look like. You have no more say in that than you have in what models to use. If raiders had the option, they would replace all models with rectangular blocks with hp bars.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's all too obvious Blizzard are doing these changes in order to set the game up for consoles, &amp; I'm suprised I haven't seen more convo about it over the forums in recent years. They've lost over 40% of their player base in one expansion alone, of course they're trying to take measures to make an extra buck, it's business right. lol The thing that will be interesting to see come Legion, &amp; this is evident from WOD alone, is that the WOW community ain't all sheep. They will express themselves &amp; shun the game if Blizzard annoys them enough with silly changes, &amp; this is a silly change to say the least! Legion will be interesting indeed hehe :)<br />

<br />
If you don't want the advantage, that's your choice. Shouldn't limit us, and in the end as I explained on the previous page, the end result will be raiders that needs this functionality to perform at their peak will just use scripts to quickly change the hardcoded variables in the configs of the game to get the old zoom back every single time they relog. It's tedious and meaningless but it'll become a necessary step every time we switch characters to have what we consider a &quot;fulfilling&quot; game experience. We'll still retain the &quot;advantage&quot; one way or another, it's blizzard's choice if they want it to go from &quot;google a console command to permanently unlock max zoom&quot; that they say &quot;most people don't know&quot;, to &quot;use a script every time you relog to set your max zoom for that session, and deactivate zoom buttons so it doesn't reset and thus giving you no chance of zooming in at all&quot; that only the extreme minority will use, requiring far more input to achieve.</div></div><hr />

They're not changing it because they think you should have to play the game a certain way, they're changing it because its not fair atm to the people that don't know about hidden variables. To make if fair they had to get rid of the option or increase the slider and I'm guessing most players don't enjoy having the camera miles away from their character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Question is, why does it matter if they enjoy having the camera miles from their character? That's not an issue. Just don't set the slider to &quot;max&quot; and you'll have the exact same experience. Extending the slider wouldn't have hurt their enjoyment any. <br />

If Blizzard wanted to remove this because of a competitive advantage they would have simply increased the slider so there was some &quot;hidden&quot; console command. There, fair game. They aren't doing that, which means the reason for this change is something else. They claim that to be as a result of a &quot;design choice&quot; yet I didn't know their design intent was that I can only see Archimondes toes and he takes up 50% of my screen if I'm a melee.</div></div><hr />

But now they removed a feature and some people don't enjoy their camera in the bosses knees with 100 spell effects in their face. To make it fair the feature should've stayed, and if people didn't want to use it that would be on them. Now everyone is forced to play in a certain way whether they want to or not.</div></div><hr />

Honestly the poll doesn't even make sense if you've never heard of zooming out past the slider before. The title is &quot;The latest Legion build reduced the amount you can zoom out with the camera.&quot; It doesn't say anything about the hidden variables unless you read the whole thing. And the poll itself sounds like its asking if you use a camera zoom that's farther than default slider position, which I'm sure almost everyone does. I'm just saying I wouldn't take it as proof that 75% of the player base uses the hidden vars.</div></div><hr />

Does insane max distance make encounters easier? Oh hell yes it does, no argument. You know what else would make encounters easier? Transparent textures, drawing on screen, etc. Arguing that the change is bad because it makes encounters harder is a REALLY bad argument - because it's not up to you to decide how hard the encounters should be.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I agree that melee with massive bosses looks ridiculous, but zoom is a really shitty solution to this problem. A bandaid solution.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fabinas</div><div class="date">2016-06-26, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was always a choice, but it had two problems.<br />
The first issue was the lack of accessibility of the full option to most players.<br />
There is in my opinion too much stuff hidden behind CVars.<br />
<br />
The second more subjective one is that the maximum was too much.<br />
Blizzard are addressing both, with the second one being something that it is impossible to please everyone with.<br />
If they had raised it even someone would have complained it wasn't enough.<br />
<br />
For anyone caring enough to see more of the world, the presumed &quot;lack of accessibility&quot; could be found with a simple google search. Furthermore, in raiding environments, information about that and other &quot;hidden&quot; facts were tossed around whenever you asked stuff. People who want extra camera distance are not &quot;cheating&quot; on people who don't use it. Getting more information about the game world (either pvp or pve) isn't cheating. If i find i want a different perspective in a game i actively look out for options, whther &quot;hidden&quot; or readily available.<br />
<br />
One of the reasons i never bought starcraft 2 (hell i havent even finished the free campaign) is the small visible area. Same with Diablo and HotS. A single camera view is too limiting for my personal gaming experience. Especially when i had a choice in WoW for years. Removing choice is never a good thing.<br />
<br />
Although i'm far from believeing conspiracy theories, all those &quot;design&quot; choices, the pruning, the simplification, adding mini games in the game and now this...<br />
one can't help but really consider the idea that WoW will be turned to a console game. Every day, a little more.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I play zoomed out, with most raid bosses at the cvar max, but with the new action camera options, we'll be able to<br />
see the whole bossmodel anyways. And that's what I wanted. I always wanted to have my character closer and that's now possible.</div></div><hr />

I can't believe it that they didn't even ask first. Make a poll or something, it's super obvious that nobody would agree to this.<br />
Can't even type a reply on the forum for them to see, cause it always says &quot;No characters were found&quot;. I hope we get the message through them just like with the Reins of the Crimson Water Strider when they wanted to nerf it in Legion so they can see how horrible this decision is and maybe revert it back. They can even put that hidden option into that drag bar. It doesn't need to be hidden.<br />
I always played with the max distance camera, if I could I would have zoomed even more....... especially in raids. I mean COME ON BLIZZARD.....<br />
Why do games keep forcing us into close cameras I can't understand. I HATE Dota (for example) 85 % just because it's such close camera and it was a very strong point that I loved about WoW, that it allowed me the freedom of zooming out. I can't believe they are going to remove this, its so disappointing!!!!</div></div><hr />
