<br />
Note: We’re planning another round of class tuning for later in the week once we have more data from live realms; these are merely a first pass. Additionally, we plan to partially reduce the 7.2.5 nerf to Draught of Souls for Fury Warriors.<br />
<br />
We’ll share full details on all of these changes as soon as possible.<br />

7.2.5 Enhancement Class Discussion<br />
We talked about it more and decided to let Stormstrike and Windstrike offhand attacks proc Stormbringer for now.<br />
<br />
The thinking above is still true, and something we want to keep an eye on, but the changes already in place mean the numbers are quite different from the 7.0 version. In 7.0, if you had e.g. a 10% chance to proc from Stormstrike (main hand only), and 0% from Lava Lash and Boulderfist (and the procs were worth double due to Tempest), there was a huge swing in proc chance between using 3 Stormstrikes and using 3 other buttons. In 7.2.5, you may have 8% from the Lava Lash and Rockbiter, and 16% from the Stormstrike, and the a proc causes you to replace 2 other buttons with 2 Stormstrikes. The swing is much smaller now.<br />
<br />
Because the 7.2.5 changes would already reduce the streakiness of Stormbringer procs (and because allowing offhands to proc is slightly more consistent with the tooltips), we'll let that play out on live and inform whether we need to make future changes to mitigate that streakiness further.

It's also fun seeing people act like you do acting like the DH community is crying because of a nerf, when, if you actually knew anything, you'd realize DHs didn't actually receive a nerf. The issue is Havoc was promised major changes at the beginning of the patch cycle, we got a change that was a huge quality of life improvement, didn't really buff or nerf DPS, just removed a layer of RNG. Then, less than one week before the patch is set to go live, they revert it. They never once communicated anything in regards to plans for DH through the whole patch cycle that, again, was promised to have &quot;Major Changes&quot; and all that happened was 2 minor changes to 2 talents and a legendary nerf.<br />

All the DH community is asking at this point is some god damned communication. Anything at all.</div></div><hr />

Demon Hunters have been consistently near the top, and both Shaman specs are at the bottom. God forbid they buffed one of the worst classes while giving a nerf to a class that will STILL be in the top 5 after the nerfs. Jesus you people are sad.</div></div><hr />

I'll cry you a river so big you'll drawn in it. Get your head out of your own ass please and know what you're talking about before coming across like an ass. We're not asking for a buff. Hell, the change would be result in a very small nerf but would make the rotation that much more tolerable as the fury generation would become smoother.<br />
Demon hunters already have 4 layers of RNG to their rotation, asking for a bit more stable rotation shouldn't kill anyone. If you're so offended that we want some QoL changes then I'm oh so terribly sorry that I offended you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not about dps. It's about QoL changes. The DB change they had originally made resulted in slighty less fury. What it did however was remove some of the RNG from the rotation. Sometimes we'd have a lot of fury from lucky streaks and other times we'd be standing there auto attacking for 5, 10 or 15 seconds with barely any fury.<br />
<br />
I'd gladly give a bit of dps for a smoother rotation. I don't really care about the other changes we got. Prepared is STILL behind demon blades.<br />

Cute, sarcasm. He should know full well Blizzard suck at balancing especially when it comes to new classes, like with DKs. Anyone maining a DH should of known this before picking one, it's the whole reason I didn't want to play one, the roller coaster will persist for the rest of this expansion until they figure out exactly where they want DHs to be.<br />
<br />
Is that his fault? No, not entirely, but he should of had some foresight if he wanted to play a top DPS class. <br />

I used WW Monks as an example of a class that's been ignored more than Demon Hunters, read your initial post, you act as if only DHs are hard done by and that's not true at all, if you're an example of the DH community then I'm honestly not surprised they've been ignoring DHs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think DPS has anything to do with it. DH was simply requested for years and now it is available. Maybe he should have known that Blizzard sucks at balancing, but making a class fun is not a question of balance. It's about how your abilities interact with each other. See, the thing is, if you dont PVP and dont do hardcore raiding, balance isn't that important. But a class being boring to play can leave a sour taste in your mouth.</div></div><hr />

No melee player should even fucking complain when all you do in raids is tunnel the boss while ranged deal with mechanics.<br />
<br />
as if melee hasnt done that for years when range could just tunnel boss.</div></div><hr />

I've raided as melee in previous expansions and it wasn't that bad compared to it is now as a ranged player.</div></div><hr />

Imagine doing Krosus, the patchwerk of NH. one day I pull 600k dps, same group, same buffs, do it once more and now I'm 1.2million dps. sure the latter feels good, but the former feels terrible.<br />
<br />
for almost the ENTIRE PTR cycle they changed that RNG procc to a 100% chance with (needed) nerfs to everything else to balance it out. it makes you more consistent. in the end is was less fury gen/ damage done on average than before, but it was much smoother and more predictable.<br />
<br />
last week they reverted that ONE change and retained all the other adjustments. so we have the (PTR justified nerfs due to talent change) nerfs without the reason for said nerfs around anymore. RNGesus takes the wheel.<br />

Stop looking at simulated parses and let's see real world encounters. unless you're in the top 1-5% of guilds, you aren't getting benched because of your class. I have ran with people 20ilvls lower than same class and smashing the others. some people are good at what they play, other's (regardless of gear) will fail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What a joke, you mean we shouldn't complain after every other raid zone since BC was penalizing melee with bull**** mechanics? Right.... Plus even with the ranged having to most of the mechanics in NH they can STILL dps through them, unlike melee which usually requires us to move out of dps range. I'm happy ranged actually has to do some work finally.</div></div><hr />

I don't have to imagine that. I play enhance. That's an every fight thing for us, but with much lower numbers</div></div><hr />

When there is a 600k dps difference between top dps spec and bottom.. that is not the case.</div></div><hr />
