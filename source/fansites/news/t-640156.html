Free respec for all classes in patch 3.1<br />
All characters will have their talent points refunded for 3.1. That was a necessary change in order to implement the dual-spec system. That is also one of the reasons we messed around so much with the talent trees. You are unlikely to see so much tinkering for future content patches. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864307191-hunter-31-talent-points-refund.html))<br />
<br />
Skill bonuses different in PvP and PvE<br />
We can make that distinction now. The problem, in our minds, is that at some point you're just playing two different games instead of one. WoW is already enormously complicated with all of the spells, talents, tradeskills, racials and gear you have to keep track of. We have some mechanics that work differently in PvP (typically when we can't come up with a better solution) but we view that a last resort.<br />
<br />
Just imagine all the tooltips. PVE: This ability blah blah. PVP: This ability blah blah. Then you'd have to have a lot of talents affect things differently. Grants a 10% bonus in PvP or a 25% bonus in PvE. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864447066-have-the-devs-ever-considered-making.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking - Block<br />
We haven't announced any changes to block. In a theoretical space, I wonder if a better implementation would be a mechanic where the amount blocked was double (or triple) what it is currently, but you could never block every swing (even on large piles of weak mobs). <br />
<br />
Tanking - Shield Block Value<br />
I don't think we'd be likely to do away with SBV. I could see doing away with block rating. It is good for itemization to have some stats which are very defensive oriented. SBV does have some offensive potential and it does play well with Strength so it already is more versatile than say something like armor.<br />
<br />
Getting rid of block rating would be a big change and would require us to mess with several items and talents. (Read: this is probably not in the 3.1 time frame.) Ideally though, we think there might be a place for block that is in between say the guaranteed mitigation offered by armor and the RNG mitigation offered by avoidance.<br />
<br />
It might be tricky in that world to differentiate paladin and warrior blocking, and maybe we wouldn't need to. Traditionally, the paladin blocked every hit for a small amount and the warrior blocked fewer hits for a larger amount. In reality, I'm not sure that niche buys us much except for paladins being able to tank 10,000 adds without taking damage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/15668067020-can-we-get-a-blue-about-blocking.html))<br />
<br />
Using Patchwerk to compare DPS between classes<br />
In our minds, Patchwerk is not the perfect fight around which dps should be balanced. It is a relatively simple fight. However consider:<br />
<br />
1) Warriors don't get rage from taking damage on Patch. On fights where warriors get rage, their dps will go up. Which case do you balance around? (We balance around both, which is why you can't just look at the Patch numbers.)<br />
<br />
2) Patch is a very stationary fight. Certain specs do better when the boss doesn't move. Other specs care a lot less if the boss doesn't move, provided they don't have to move as well.<br />
<br />
3) Patch has no adds. Adds can add a lot to a fight. Even if you say &quot;trash doesn't matter&quot; (which we think is silly to say), there are boss fights with adds. Killing them quickly can get you back to the boss. Some classes can swap targets or do AE damage faster or more easily than others.<br />
<br />
4) Patch is a short fight. This is probably the most important factor. If you have a cooldown you can blow once every three minutes, then that cooldown counts for a lot more on a three minute fight than a five minute fight. If your cooldown lasts for 20 sec, that counts for more the shorter the fight it. We were watching dps on Ulduar fights the other day. The amount of additional dps that a raid can kick in when they need to burn something down quickly is extraordinary, sometimes double what the raid can normally do.<br />
<br />
We look at Patchwerk numbers. We don't balance around just those numbers. I also find it slightly suspicious that many raids can achieve the same dps (or within a few %s) night after night on the same boss. The delta is caused by things like RNG and skill. But that is a broader topic.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if you are downplaying skill and just assuming that every one in your raid is at the top of your game, then why did some guilds reach Illidan, Archimonde, KJ or Sarth 3D faster? You can blame it all on them being able to devote more time to the attempts if you want, but we think there is more going on. We stand by &quot;It just isn't going to turn out that way on every parse, folks.&quot;<br />
<br />
P.S. I also won't claim that the dps numbers are balanced where we want them in 3.0. Many of our 3.1 changes are designed to address those issues. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864748300-hybrids-are-not-5-away-from-pure-dps.html))<br />
<br />
Pure vs. Hybrid<br />
Our logic is actually pretty simple. If hybrid classes can do the same dps as pure classes, then why have pure classes in the game? So we design the pure classes to do slightly higher dps.<br />
<br />
We try very hard not to define &quot;slightly.&quot; I probably got cornered by a bunch of angry posters in a dark alley one evening and blurted out &quot;5%!&quot; Or maybe someone in the forums suggested 5% and it stuck.<br />
<br />
Why don't we like to refer to very explicit numbers like 5%? Because look what happens. A fine guild like Premonition or Ensidia posts their Ulduar parses, and players jump on them and say &quot;ZOMG that mage is below the warrior,&quot; or &quot;ZOMG that rogue is 7% above the paladin.&quot; It just isn't going to turn out that way on every parse, folks. Encounters are very different from each other. Gear varies. Even for fantastic guilds, skill varies. Players have to deal with things like lag or whatever mods they use or just dumb luck. RNG exists in boss fights. Strings of crits for a Fire mage or strings of parries for a DK tank can change the outcome enormously.<br />
<br />
Saying that pures should beat hybrids by 5% is like saying a penny should be tails 50% of the time. If you flip a penny infinite times, yes, it will be tails half the time. But if you flip the penny three time and don't get any tails, you shouldn't take the penny to the bank and tell them it's broken.<br />
<br />
Our goal is to give every class reasonable raid buffs and utility. None of them should be so good that you earn a spot just because of that utility. Plenty of times, your utility isn't going to be as useful because someone else has already brought that buff. This is by design. However, if you feel your class just got boned in the buff department, that is a great thing to bring up (though probably not in this thread). We used to penalize classes who had excellent buffs. Now we try to spread the wealth of both buffs and dps a lot better.<br />
<br />
We want you to get a spot because you know what the blank you're doing, not because your class is programmed to always do top dps or inflate raid dps through a miraculous spell that you impart by clicking a button every 30 min.<br />
<br />
Play your class to the best of your ability. If you do so, you will be very high on the damage meters, even if you are a druid, priest, warrior, DK, shaman or paladin. You won't top it on every fight. Some fights are better for some classes than others. Some players have better luck. Over time, the trends will emerge and most raiding players will figure them out. For our part, we will keep jimmying the numbers to get the results we want. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864857264-hybrids-and-thier-dps-tax.html))<br />

Healing Touch<br />
We think Healing Touch has a sufficient role in leveling, healing 5-player dungeons (probably glyphed), or with Nature's Swiftness.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I think it is legit that too many talents affect HT, and sometimes only HT. Long-term, that is probably something we will try and improve. If we don't do it for 3.1, it would be because we would likely have to nerf some spells in order to have the talents prop them back up and anything else that felt like Resto nerfs right now (even if they are ultimately for the good of the class as this one would be) would be pretty unpopular right now.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to imply that we won't make unpopular changes, because clearly we do. But we try and pick our battles carefully. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15864848003-a-minute-of-your-time-to-cheer-up-a-tree.html))<br />

All pets not available on Tournament Realms<br />
I suspect this is not a change we can make without a major patch. That is, this is not hotfixable. From 3.1 on, all of the pets are available. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864786898-hunters-told-to-f-off-on-the-tr.html))<br />
<br />
Differences between pets DPS<br />
Totally agree. We don't want 51-BM hunters to have fewer pet choices. We want the 51 BM talent to be a net dps increase as well as giving the player some prestige pets, that often have some nice little buffs or abilities. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864747291-bm-and-exotic-pet-data.html))<br />
<br />
Is there still any plans to look into buff scaling off a pet's master instead of buffs going directly to a pet? This might solve some of the issues with super scaling abilities.<br />
We can't do that yet, but I expect that will eventually be a direction we will go. Again, the point would not be just to nerf pets, but to make sure their power didn't vary so dramatically between buffed and non-buffed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864747291-bm-and-exotic-pet-data.html))<br />

Molten Armor changes<br />
The difference is Spirit is inflated a great deal by raid buffs and Crit Rating is not.<br />
<br />
But again, the change is not necessarily to punish mages who avoided Spirit like the plague, and my apologies if my posts have suggested that. Those non-Spirit items are not super common, so to some extent they were lucky if they put those sets together. The change is to make mages not hate the Spirit that they are almost certainly going to end up with on their gear. As long as we close the gap a great deal between Spirit and non-Spirit geared mages, then the change has done its job. I think some players were just hoping we would itemize a lot of cloth gear without Spirit. That we are not going to do. We tried to be very clear that the goal was always &quot;make Spirit work for mages&quot; not &quot;let mages easily avoid Spirit.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15671125153-mage-we-want-an-answer.html))<br />
<br />
Removing some crit to replace it by Spirit<br />
I spelled out pretty clearly that we were not going to buff mages as part of making Spirit more useful. A few sharp players even said &quot;If you lower our base damage and then let Spirit improve it, that would be good.&quot; I acknowledged that was exactly what we were likely to do. <br />
<br />
[...] When you say &quot;where we were previously&quot; do you mean with Improved Scorch or not? You have, what, 5% crit with glyphed Molten Armor? I believe it requires ~575 Spirit to get to that point. The random Naxx mages I just looked up on the Armory had 300-400 Spirit unbuffed. You can get 100 with just Divine Spirit and Mark of the Wild. That was all off the top of my head, so forgive me if some numbers are off.<br />
<br />
As I said in the other thread though, the exact conversion is something we can mess with. One to one (Spirit to Crit) would be too generous, but we have some room. <br />
<br />
[...] Many of these players are arguing that mages who avoid Spirit are not getting a huge drop in dps. It is also almost impossible to have no spirit from gear as a mage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864257244-mage-we-want-a-better-answer.html))<br />

Isn't that obvious?<br />
After the arena masters decided not to use nipples and other parts of ancient dragons to create fashionable season sets anymore, there are a lot more of them alive to be tamed. And since you are now dressed in gear looking like ugly crafting crap instead of cadavers of their ancestors, those dragons are much mor likely to accept you as master.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it is hard to sipmly say: Ok pures get in case off same luck, same skill, gear etc 5% in DPS before the hybrids.<br />
<br />
Recognize e.g. the Situation of a rogue. He has no abilities to support except TotT, which is needful in todays raidcontent. I think the Raidsupport of the Hybrid or the Buffing class should go whitin the DPS. Sounds hard, but whats e.g. with the Blessing of might from the Ret. - All melees do a lot more DPS from it, its wotk of the Ret ; Its his DPS !! The Ret would gain a big boost in DPS if you recognize that the Blessings is HIS ! When hes 5% under the Rogue.....i'll take the Ret.</div></div><hr />

We can make that distinction now. The problem, in our minds, is that at some point you're just playing two different games instead of one. WoW is already enormously complicated with all of the spells, talents, tradeskills, racials and gear you have to keep track of. We have some mechanics that work differently in PvP (typically when we can't come up with a better solution) but we view that a last resort.<br />
<br />
Just imagine all the tooltips. PVE: This ability blah blah. PVP: This ability blah blah. Then you'd have to have a lot of talents affect things differently. Grants a 10% bonus in PvP or a 25% bonus in PvE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Come on... &quot;WoW is enormously complicated&quot; and they say it would be too much work to change tooltips?<br />
<br />
I suggest blizzard looks at Guild Wars, the true PvP MMO. Number of skills is completely incomparable to WoW (read: there are several times more skills) and still they had no problem balancing them in PvP and change tooltips appropriately (in more languages than WoW has/will ever have).<br />

Your right.<br />
<br />
Doesn't look like any druid's or warrior's will be getting this mount. Hell no way a druid or warrior could get deadly gladiator...<br />
<br />
<br />
Hafu and a warrior (probably the same warrior in this 3v3) would win 2v3 matches at decent ratings last season. <br />
<br />
There's always a handful of people that can excel regardless of balance. Take for example the fact that there's 1 Priests in the top 100 right now (28 Paladins 22 DK's). Does that man the Priest class is fine because 1 person was able to do it? Or does it mean that people playing certain classes have travel an uphill road with much more skill to accomplish the same goals. <br />
<br />
<br />
On the other hand the sky is the limit and the roads are straightaways with a moderately skilled DK Paladin team. Get get some gear, don't suck, collect mount.</div></div><hr />

Just bcos it is PvP reward it doesn't mean that it will not be PvE reward to. Remember Netherdrake.<br />
And just so u know that only most skilled players can get that mount. I know what are u gonna say. &quot;Roll holy pala or DK and get the mount&quot;. Well, even if u play one of those, u still have great chances not to get it. So don't talk about something u know nothing about!</div></div><hr />

Solution: <br />
Use &lt;SHIFT&gt; or &lt;ALT&gt; modifier to see the bonuses of the spell for the zone that you are not into. When you enter Arena, you will have to use let's say &lt;SHIFT&gt; to see PVE version of the spell, and when in dungeon/raid/heroics/world you will see the PVE version of the spell. Or just make it so that you will see PVP version of the spell only when you press the key modifier. <br />
I don't mind having a totaly different effect/bonus or whatever of the spell. But at least, Blizzard should start making a difference in numbers between PVP and PVE. Just imagine that Infusion of Light might be saved having in PVP 0.5 or 0.25 seconds faster casting and in PVE 1 second faster casting. So yeah, would be superb if Blizzard finaly give up on some ideas about &quot;how bizare is to have an overloaded tooltip&quot; when there are plenty solutions to avoid the overloading of the tooltip.

The comparison was against a 20sec cooldown which would get 15 refreshes to the 1 for 3min. They are balanced on ~9 refreshes to 1, so in that case the 20sec CD gets far more value. If the fight went 6:20 they would have similar benefit again.</div></div><hr />

Paladins are just easier to be &quot;okay&quot; on, =/= Gladiator-good. Also, they play with DKs 90% of the time since people seem to have the fact that priests and shamans (even druids in some cases) can work with DK's just as good. That would be for 2v2, in 3v3 let's not talk about druid or shaman + lock + hunter, please, and when it comes down to 5v5, pretty much every team bar the old JAC setup and Eurocomp didn't have a paladin in the previous seasons, so let's not go there.<br />

If a hybrid class is able to do as much dps as a pure dps class then that shouldnt be a problem. What makes hybrid classes better then most pure classes is the fact that, in WoW, hybrid classes sacrifice next to nothing in order to get to the level of a pure dps class. And that in my opinion is the problem, and in my opinion is what causes most imbalance issues. <br />
<br />
If hybrid classes want to do as much dps as a pure dps class they have to sacrifice something important in order to do so. If a paladin wants top dps, he should have crappy heals (longer cast time or reduced heals), a crappy bubble (longer cooldown, reduced duration, absorbs less damage, etc), and lower armor. But that isnt the case, their heals, bubble, and armor stay the same; they dont get better but they dont get worse either. If a ret specced paladin sacrificed his bubble (not able to even use it anymore) and a small portion of his armor, then by all means be able to do the dps a rogue can do. If not then keep your ass at in the 7-10 dps rank in a 25 man raid. <br />
<br />
This is waaay more evident in hybrid plate classes then other hybrid classes. There are certain things a pure dps classes sacrifices from the get go to get the dps they have. The most fundamental thing they sacrifice is the ability to take a hit. That is one thing that hybrid plate classes at the very least should sacrifice in order to do dps: their ability to mitigate damage, sacrificing their ability to block/dodge/parry and/or a bit of their armor is not enough. If you want to dps like a rogue, warlock or a mage, you damn well better be just as squishy. But this isnt the case, plate classes sacrifice no where near the amount pure dps classes sacrifice. <br />
<br />
Other cases the balance is there. Priests get a huge nerf to their healing ability if specced shadow, they get a nerf to their AoE healing ability if specced Disc. Druids get a huge nerf to their melee dps if they spec boomkin, and vice versa. <br />
<br />

Do you wanna tank heal and dps with one toon pick up paly or druid<br />
You wanna dps and heal pick priest or shaman.<br />
You wanna dps with pet. Pick up hunter or warlock.<br />
You like dps like warrior do..pick him up, or maybe you prefer mage style so pick up one.<br />
<br />
You choosing your character because he can heal tank and dps, or you pich it up becasue you like to play it ? If your character can dps only it means it is less fun?. I like my warlock because i like how he dps. He cant heal, who cares. I got shaman if i want to heal. Oh i like my shadow priest it is so fun to play and he can heal to.<br />
<br />
Do i have to be sorry for you that you cant heal and i can. Or do i have to be shame that my toon can dps and have nice pet. This is your choose who you pick up.<br />
If toon can dps he should dps same as others. If he heal should heal as others. If he can tank he should tank as good as others. You like how its work???? Play it !!!</div></div><hr />

Anyway, on to the Frostwyrm. I'm a little surprised that they used it already.

Skill bonuses different in PvP and PvE<br />
We can make that distinction now. The problem, in our minds, is that at some point you're just playing two different games instead of one. WoW is already enormously complicated with all of the spells, talents, tradeskills, racials and gear you have to keep track of. We have some mechanics that work differently in PvP (typically when we can't come up with a better solution) but we view that a last resort.<br />
<br />
Just imagine all the tooltips. PVE: This ability blah blah. PVP: This ability blah blah. Then you'd have to have a lot of talents affect things differently. Grants a 10% bonus in PvP or a 25% bonus in PvE. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864447066-have-the-devs-ever-considered-making.html))<br />

We can make that distinction now. The problem, in our minds, is that at some point you're just playing two different games instead of one. WoW is already enormously complicated with all of the spells, talents, tradeskills, racials and gear you have to keep track of. We have some mechanics that work differently in PvP (typically when we can't come up with a better solution) but we view that a last resort.<br />
<br />
Taken from someone on wow forums, but it sums up my feelings perfectly:<br />
<br />
Pros: <br />
Better PvE balance <br />
Better PvP balance <br />
More leeway for unique skills <br />
Fewer class breaking changes <br />
<br />
Cons: <br />
Longer tooltips <br />
<br />
Hmmmmm...</div></div><hr />

<br />
A raid will never be dependent or expect healing from a DPS spec'd Shaman, Druid, or Priest. At the most they'll be asked to decurse, cleanse, or dispel... which is no different than the &quot;pure&quot; DPS classes who can do the same thing.<br />
<br />
The closest thing to a hybrid would be Dks and feral Druids. I can't speak for Dks since I've barely looked at their trees at all, but Blizz has done a decent job of splitting DPS Feral from tanking feral. A Druid that switches between tanking and DPS will have to make sacrifices and perform worst than anyone with a dedicated spec (the 5% rule!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It only address dpsers cause there isnt a pure healer class. It doesnt address tank too, again cause there is no a pure tank class.<br />
<br />
What ppl cant seem to understand is that, if hybrids do the same dps of a pure dpser, why a player should prefer a pure dps class?<br />
Don't answer playstyle and preference, cause if you start the game you cant know which class you will like the most, you will go on a forum and you will ask for a class suggestion and ppl will say that you should chose a hybrid so you can turn yourself in what you like the most.<br />
<br />
The problem is another one, if pure classes are supposed to do more dps in a raid environment, why a raid leader should bring a hybrid to dps in a raid? Utilities? I think you can get all the utilities you need from healers, tanks and pure dpsers, so the problem keep going on...</div></div><hr />

If a rogue sacrificed his Vanish...<br />

<br />
<br />
So you are saying they should sacrifice more then they already have in order to do the dps they should be doing?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you wanna tank heal and dps with one toon pick up paly or druid<br />
You wanna dps and heal pick priest or shaman.<br />
You wanna dps with pet. Pick up hunter or warlock.<br />
You like dps like warrior do..pick him up, or maybe you prefer mage style so pick up one.<br />
<br />
You choosing your character because he can heal tank and dps, or you pich it up becasue you like to play it ? If your character can dps only it means it is less fun?. I like my warlock because i like how he dps. He cant heal, who cares. I got shaman if i want to heal. Oh i like my shadow priest it is so fun to play and he can heal to.<br />
<br />
Do i have to be sorry for you that you cant heal and i can. Or do i have to be shame that my toon can dps and have nice pet. This is your choose who you pick up.<br />
If toon can dps he should dps same as others. If he heal should heal as others. If he can tank he should tank as good as others. You like how its work???? Play it !!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lol I am not saying anything about the fun factor. What I said was towards the perception of imbalance of classes in terms of PvE and PvP. Neither did I say to feel sorry for me, as an affliction warlock I have no problem at all topping the dps meters. If a class can dps the same as all the other classes, but has more armor and can heal/shield himself, do you not think that is over powered? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
How are there no such things as hybrids in WoW? Any class that has the ability to do 1 or more things well if they choose to is a hybrid class, at least in my opinion. The best example of a pure dps class is a mage. Mages do one thing and one thing only, dps. Warlocks and rogues, if geared and specced correctly can tank.... sort of.<br />
<br />
Druids are a great example of class balance, I completely agree with what you said about them. They are meant to switch from one form to another, I mean thats the way their class is built. The reason they are so balanced is because they sacrifice something for each form. Its similar to warriors stance dancing. <br />
<br />
The bring the player not the class mentality is awesome I am all for it, but I do hate the homogenization of the buffs, I really think every class should be able to bring something unique to the table without ever being needed (blizzard can do this if they put their minds to it); and I am not the whole ranged/caster/melee thing just something that is unique to each class or build that helps out but doesnt overly tip the scales. <br />
<br />
PvE-wise I think the balance is getting there, its getting really close. The warlock builds are very very close to each other in terms of potential dps, so close in fact that player error/skill tips the scales. PvP-wise there is a VERY clear imbalance, my post was purely to show what I think is the major imbalance between the classes.</div></div><hr />

Dude, do you think that be a priest who can heal will be usefull in pvp if i play shadow.<br />
Can i heal myself during combat, sure i can. But it will burn most my mana, and will be VERY unefective, read useless. Sure shamy elemental can heal himself too, so what, he will burn whole his mana and heal very little. <br />
If you go deep in trees you cant do a thing besides who you are. Yea i can drop shadow and do heal. But its useless without proper talents, glyphs, gear chants etc.<br />
So i still dont get it. Yea paly can bubble. But this is an exeption.<br />
I will tell it one more time. You wanna kick gnome asses, pick some class who you like to play.<br />
If you wanna heal pick something that you enjoy.<br />
Happy hunting</div></div><hr />

Lol again I will say it one more time. This is NOT CONCERNING THE FUN FACTOR. What are you not understanding. I have a lot of fun on my warlock, in fact its the only class I have leveled to 80. Did you not read my post? The fact there are exceptions makes classes unbalanced with each other. How are you not understanding this? I have fun playing WoW. I am merely stating what I think is wrong with the balance between classes. I never said that priests were overpowered, in fact I said they are balanced. There is a reason why I picked a paladin as my example, because a retribution specced paladin is the exception to all of the things I have said. You even say that the paladin is an exception. And sure you can play any class you like to play, but you wont kick gnome asses if they are paladins. Why? Because they are the exception. <br />
<br />
Just because I point these things out doesnt mean I dont have fun playing WoW. <br />
<br />
Would you like me to repeat everything I just said so you can finally understand what I am trying to get at?</div></div><hr />

Because they don't actually play anything like a hybrid. The fact that the enhancement shaman has a few healing spells in his book is 100% meaningless to a raid. The fact that a Fury Warrior can equip a shield is NEVER going to include or exclude him from a raid's roster. These specs are invited to the raid for the exact same reasons as Hunters, Warlocks, Mages, and Rogues; its dp classes competing for dps slots. Imposing a 5% damage tax on the &quot;hybrids&quot; is just going to squeeze them out of the raid once all the buffs are sorted out.<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, what makes Ferals an effective hybrid is the way that their trees are built and the fact that homogenization allows Druid to wear a lot of the same gear for tanking and DPS. A Fury Warriors hopping into Def stance is still going to be DESTROYED if he's asked to tank something worthwhile.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I totally agree on both these points. I use to be a crazy altoholic but all the homogenization has really killed my desire to level up the different classes since a lot of differences are now just cosmetic.</div></div><hr />

You cant dps and heal because it suck.<br />
You cant dps tank and heal because it suck.<br />
You have an option to choose betwen dps, heal or tank tree (sometimes). When you make a choice, forget about hybrid problem. Sure you can switch your talents gather second set of gear. But this is your unique class thing, Like pet in hunter or warlock. You wanna lvl up one toon but still gather complete set for each purpose, choose druid or paly. You wanna have more toons, one for dps one r heal one for tank, pick one which you like to play. Dont like it after 30 lvls? change it. So if you are deep in dps and your opponent is deep in dps. He shouldnt say oh its priest hybrid, i will squeze him. Or oh its druid complete hybrid he can tank heal and dps so he sucks even more in every spec. One thing that doesnt match to jigsaw is fcuking paly bubble, but i think blizz got some idea how to in small steps turn it off.<br />

It might be meaningless to a raid now, but it's not meaningless to the player. Lets say that enhancement shaman gets bored and wants to do something new. They can just respec and start playing a healer, in the current faceroll content they can probably pick up full healing gear in a week or two if they don't already have it. Pure DPS classes don't have that luxury. When I started I wanted to play DPS, so I picked a pure DPS class. If hybrids could do the same DPS as pures then of course I would've picked a hybrid, it would be stupid not to.<br />
<br />
With dual specs it absolutely does matter to a raid that a hybrid can change roles. Why take a rogue if a fury warrior can do the same DPS but can respec into a tank for fights or trash packs where an extra tank is useful?<br />
<br />
What's wrong with having classes that buff and classes that turn buffs into DPS? That way you need a certain number of hybrids and a certain number of pure classes. The answer, of course, is that the game is being dumbed down to a state where you can just pick up a random raid off the trade channel and go smack down all the loot piñatas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So what if someone specs something else? They are no longer a DPS class and they aren't competing for a DPS slot in the raid. And every class has 3 unique specs that play differently. If I get bored of my Affliction Warlock, I can respec destruction and its almost like a whole new class... except i don't need an entirely new set of gear. Its no different from going DPS hybrid to healing hyrbid. If healing appeals to you and its something you would have enjoyed doing at some point then you probably rolled the wrong class. I rolled an enhancement Shaman to DPS. I have no interest in ever specing healing. When Dual specs come out I'm going to have a PvE and PvP spec like most others.<br />
<br />
Raids have designated tanks, designated healers, and designated DPS. If a Fury Warrior is invited to a raid it is to DPS, the chances of a raid asking him to tank are extremely slim and usually come down to one of the actual tanks having to leave early; in which case another DPS has to be brought in.<br />
<br />
If &quot;Hybrids&quot; have a 5% damage penalty, after buffs are filled, who do you think is going to get all the DPS slots in a raid?</div></div><hr />

Are you fucking retarded? No, pressing the same buttons to make different animations hit the boss is not even close to the same as going DPS-&gt;Healing.</div></div><hr />
