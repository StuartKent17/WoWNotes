Shadowmourne Quest (The Sacred and the Corrupt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24545/the-sacred-and-the-corrupt/))<br />
The quest requires friendly Ashen Verdict rep to begin. It may also only be acquired by Warriors, Paladins and Death Knights. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/21043890156-the-sacred-and-corrupt-shadowmourn-quest.html))<br />

Armored Froswtyrms confirmed to be PvE Rewards<br />
There will be a Frostwyrms up for grabs for Icecrown raiders, achievable in a similar way to previous rewards such as the Ulduar proto-drake. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/11541814430-giving-frostwyrms-to-raiders.html))<br />
<br />
Icewell &quot;Radiance&quot; (Chill of the Throne)<br />
The &quot;Icewell Radiance&quot; is designed to account for very high avoidance levels. It lets us lower the damage bosses do per hit because their hits will connect more often, keeping boss dps the same but lowering spike damage.<br />
<br />
However, I also know what that message says to some people. It says that if I go into Icecrown and wipe on a boss all night that Blizzard lied to me about boss damage. We're just sort of bracing ourselves for the inevitable &quot;I couldn't beat Marrowgar because he hits so hard. I thought bosses wouldn't hit hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bosses hitting less hard does not mean bosses can now be facerolled. It just means they hit less hard. To be fair, most of the folks posting in this thread understand the difference. But it's not uncommon for us to see our quotes misused in other forums where we can't necessarily bop in to correct the misunderstanding.

Feral Tanks in Cataclysm<br />
We talked about druids in bear form also getting AP from strength. Strength won't appear on leather and no piece should have Str and Agi together, so it's not like they would really double dip. That lets us still have tanking necks, rings and cloaks with strength on them that are attractive to all 4 tanking classes.<br />
<br />
Almost all the items in the game are going to have to change. In many cases this is just a sweeping pass we can make on all gear, such as replacing the Agi + AP on leather with just Agi. So don't worry too much about what happens with old gear and talents mixed with the new stat system. The gear and talents in many cases must change.

Fingers of Frost<br />
The Fingers of Frost issue is really challenging to solve. It it procs on hit then the procs don't get eaten but you may have to interrupt a Frostbolt. If it procs on cast, the procs can get eaten. Those are really the only ways it can proc though. Mixing travel-time spells and instant spells can muddy things up. Things also get more complicated when you have silly amounts of haste, which through no fault of their own, many mages do.<br />
<br />
Fingers of Frost seems to work fine so long as you have Frostbite, but due to some technical limitations, the two talents don't play well apart. A long-term solution might be to make Frostbite a prereq for FoF or just merge the two talents together.<br />
<br />
Letting Fingers of Frost display its charges is a good idea. We might not be able to get that in for 3.3 but we'll put it on &quot;the list.&quot;<br />
<br />
Our thanks to Lhivera and others among you who have explored these issues so throughly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21043889664-fingers-of-frost-problem-any-analogs.html))<br />

Elemental Tier 9 Nerf<br />
We don't want players to stick with older tier sets when new pieces become available. (It's one thing if it's a really good trinket -- it's another if it's your entire set..)<br />
<br />
We balance some things around absolute values (we're shooting for a target) and other things around relative values (how X looks compared to Y). A lot of shaman were saying they weren't going to upgrade to tier 10 despite the, frankly, gratuitous stats on the new gear. We concluded that was because the T9 set bonus was too good and the T10 set bonus was too weak. We suspected the T9 was too good for some time, but didn't want to nerf it while the T9 was all that was available. We did the same thing with a few other sets (or relics).<br />
<br />
We try to pick interesting set bonuses, but that means that they will sometimes end up being over or under-budget once players figure out the best ways to optimize their play style around the bonuses. A little of that is okay -- it's interesting when a new set changes your spell rotation a little bit. But when an older set is so good that players feel like upgrading is a bad thing (ignoring the pain of having to get new enchants and gems or whatever) then we think we have a problem.<br />
<br />
From a player point of view, I can understand why the attractive answer is always just to buff the new stuff. But continually buffing an outlier instead of bringing the outlier back into the pack is a good way to lead to power inflation on gear.

Soul Shard System in Cataclysm Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21043890177-gc-soul-shard-resource-system-implementation.html))<br />
I can't answer Q&amp;As like this all the time or even very often. I probably won't be able to keep coming back to this thread to answer follow up questions. Understand that when I do answer some questions and it drives expectations that everyone is entitled to have *their* questions answers, things get complicated. Sorry for all of the caveats, but I've kind of learned what to expect.<br />
<br />
1. Will it be implemented in Cataclsysm or faded in through patches considering the seemingly huge gap in content? <br />
Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
2. Even with the new system will warlocks be given a secondary defense to fall back on, on a long CD should fear become useless? <br />
You mean like Demonic Circle? :)<br />
<br />
3. Are there plans to link the system to a warlock pet? I know fel domination is one of them, but popping soul shards for more power for the pet are being considered? Example- Refreshing CD's? <br />
Sure. We don't have a lot of details we can share yet.<br />
<br />
4. What is going to happen to those spells that required soul shards? <br />
They won't. Some of them may change though. Perhaps the un-enhanced version will be weaker than the current shard version. Stuff like summoning (people and demons) just won't cost shards.<br />
<br />
5. Are there plans to change hellfire to an AoE knockback snare like a secondary defense warlocks can fall back on or will it be outright removed? <br />
No, there are no plans.<br />
<br />
6. Are there plans to extend Inferno's duration similar to before where we have to enslave him, but with no capping prohibitions? <br />
As I opined recently, IN-FER-NO probably just needs a different mechanic. The trade-off for getting the demon can just be the cooldown.<br />
<br />
7. Are there plans to reduce slot problems with curses? Like CoT and CoEx being merged? <br />
Yes to the general question, no to the specific example.<br />
<br />
8. Are there plans to add dispel resistance to curses through talents? <br />
Probably not. We'd rather tone down the potency of dispels in general, not require everyone to stack more defenses for them.<br />
<br />
9. Will CoD be modified to be castable on players? If so will you modify the damage/duration/CD on it or will it remain the same? <br />
We haven't talked about it.<br />
<br />
10. Do you plan on fixing the debuff problems to pets. The fact the duration on debuffs remain the same until the pet is out on the field while buffs continue their duration course regardless of the pet being summoned or not? <br />
This isn't really a soul shard question is it? That is more of a technical limitation and not a design goal. The answer has more to do with prioritization than intent.<br />
<br />
11. Will soul link be removed from the demon should it despawn/dimiss? <br />
Don't know yet.<br />
<br />
12. What are the plans for drain soul in the new shard system? <br />
Don't know yet. One idea is an emergency backup system for long fights or situations where you screw up. Ideally we don't need this though so we haven't resolved it.<br />
<br />
13. Are there plans to make enslave demon a little more viable for PvP and example is the doomguard and inferno?<br />
If you're talking about warlocks stealing each other's demons, I'm not sure that will lead to those demons getting more use. It might make you giggle when you steal one though.<br />
<br />
11) Will the soul shard system allow you to empower our primary nukes chaos bolt/soul fire for increased damage on a short cd? <br />
Yes. The example we used at Blizzcon was some kind of duration-limited or &quot;your next spell&quot; limitation. We haven't set this in stone yet.<br />
<br />
12) What will happen to soul fire? Will it still require a shard to use? Could it find more acceptance in our normal rotation considering its potentially our most powerful nuke <br />
It won't require a shard. It might require a shard to make it something you want to cast though (imagine a PoM - Pyro).<br />
<br />
13) How will the soul shard change work in regards to different trees?<br />
No idea yet. The talent trees aren't done. One thing we threw out at Blizzcon was maybe Demo gets an extra shard, but that's just hand-waving at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
First week of December at the earliest. No way they release next week, it's US Thanksgiving. Europeans may not know what this means (other than it's a holiday for us), but a great deal of people will be traveling or caught up in family obligations. Not to mention that people traditionally get both Thursday and Friday off. Certainly Blizzard will have to maintain support personnel regardless, but dealing with the potential extra load of a patch week during a week when the maximum number of people will be trying to get time off is just silly.</div></div><hr />

Except Marrowgar (used in the example) won't be gated in any way. None of the bosses in the first release quarter is gated or attempt limited. You'll be able to fight Marrowgar, and fight him as often as you like on the first night of the patch. I'm starting to think some MMO-Champions posters are illiterates who never actually read the blue posts.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Ashen Verdict provides reinforcements and material for players to assault Icecrown Citadel, but this support is not endless. Raids will have a limited number of attempts total each week to defeat the four most difficult encounters in Icecrown Citadel: Professor Putricide, Blood-Queen Lana'thel, Sindragosa, and the Lich King.<br />
<br />
Do you see Marrowgar mentioned? I didn't think so. I don't exactly like the way Blizzard is handling ICC release either, but at least understand it before you make comments that make no sense.</div></div><hr />

It's going to be interesting - seeing the Warlock community somewhat divided between those who have Cataclysm or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you a moron? Class changes go in with patches whether you get the expansion or not... There will be a big pre-Cataclysm patch that puts in all the new systems,stat changes, zone changes, new talents, etc... This also goes for the soul shard system... you don't get to choose if you go by it or not just like you don't get to choose to stay in the old version of Azeroth... This is how its been for all expansions...<br />
<br />
Also that &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; had barely any info at all... and if they don't add new defensive abilities (because ghetto blink is hardly a defense when you can just be stun locked or are facing ranged classes) then warlocks will fall even further behind in PvP...</div></div><hr />

NO<br />
<br />
Lol; NO what? Sunwell was released in patch 2.4 on March 25th.<br />
It was gated, exactly like Icecrown will be. So lets say 3.3 comes out in 2 weeks on this coming Tuesday making it December 8th.<br />
Assuming the gates for ICC are released somewhat similar to when Sunwell was released it will be four instead of three this time.<br />
Sunwell had the first gate opened 2 weeks after being released. The second was opened 3 weeks later and the third was opened another 3 weeks after.<br />
So if 3.3 comes out on December 8th, and we give two/three weeks for the first gate to unlock it'll be 22nd/29th of December.<br />
The next gate opens roughly the same at two/three weeks later and it's January 5th/12th for the second gate to unlock.<br />
Another two/three weeks later the third gate opens and it's January 19th/26th. Fourth and final gate would open around February 2nd/9th.<br />
Then we have the period of time where we farm ICC and wait for more news on Cataclysm. Assuming beta pops in around July (following Wotlk beta).<br />
Gives another couple of months for us to farm more of ICC and players to participate in beta.<br />

Aaaaaaahahahahahahaha! *wipes away tear* With the amount of &quot;I dont know yet&quot; that was in the Warlock Q&amp;A, Cata is not even close to being done.

I doubt that soon because they'll leave us a fair chunk of months to farm ICC.<br />
Then on top of that there's the beta for Cataclysm.<br />

@Daelos<br />
Yeah I did mean 2010 lol, there's no way in hell they'd release it for Christmas this year.<br />

<br />
I think the biggest deal, is that while you do just need to do quests, one of the quests requires that you obtain either 45 or 60 shards from the frozen throne, and I believe those may be very Atiesh/Val'Anyr like, and only drop 1-2 per boss. If that's so, it would be a shame to ever see a hunter with this axe. <br />

(assuming you are unlucky and block 10 times in a row)), thanks alot for removing more and more (less parts with block on items) per raid tier (if it's that fucking hard to implement block gear in instances due to your new pets the dk tanks, pls feel free to add block gear at emblem vendors)...<br />
and then giving us more avoidance stats, especially dodge, which again is going to be mitigated away by &quot;icewell radiance&quot;? thought you said at the start of wotlk that debuffs like that wheren't going to be needed anymore? as for the agrument you use &quot;too high jumps in iLVL&quot;, have seen items in aq40 that had lower iLVL than MC items but still where concidered an upgrade.<br />
People seem to think that there is a lack of tanks avible to tank instances and raids at the moment. have you taken the time to concider that this may be because all the tanking gear you are offering does not scale very well with the core mechanics of paladin tanks and to some extent warrior tanks. can see if you don't want to add items to high end raids that only 2/3 of the plate tanks can use, but seeing as most of us have embles pouring out of our asses, might it be an idea to adds the more class-mechanic-linked items through emblems for us, so that those of us that want to go for what could/should be our main stats when gearing for tanking, actually could do so?</div></div><hr />

I raid with dual wield, I PvP with dual wield, but I love two hands, so why won't they just allow Shamans (and Hunters, though they're a range class) to obtain Shadowmourne? It's not like Shamans are gonna roll against the other classes for a drop, like Eye of Sulfuras. Only do quests, and you can switch weapon in combat, so I don't see how this would even damage the raid dps (a lot), if you even have to use Shadowmourne when doing the kill X boss quests... I would probably never be able to obtain it, but I think it's a retarded thing to do by Blizz, because some shamans (or hunters) might.<br />
<br />
Your a dumbshit. Last time i check, shammys and hunters were an Agi=Ap class? am i right? have you even seen the axe? its a Str stick... gtfo and get some fist weapons, or a some other cute little Agi 1h's you scrub</div></div><hr />

- people having troubles getting the downloader to start, delete/move your backgrounddownloader.exe and run the repair.exe tool. This will download the backgrounddownloader again and the patch will begin downloading. Worked for me and several others on the official eu forums. Just a lil' help!</div></div><hr />

<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
I still love my class, but it's like they stopped caring for locks for most of LK - in a lot of aspects - and hope to make it all up in Cata. With the history warlocks have (mostly the 'we are not sure what direction we want to go to with you guys' ever since release), I'm kinda concerned.<br />

If you read the post, you'll find that GC stated right up front that he really didn't have time to fully address the questions, and that he had hesitations of even responding to it. He did not go hold a meeting and get everybody's status and have a special &quot;Some dude on the forum had a list of warlock questions let's hunker down&quot;. <br />
<br />
Dude just shut from the cuff and called out his gut answers. Notice he leaves most of it vague. We're not sure how we're going to do this yet. We haven't decided this yet.<br />

Basically, re-align your damn expectations.</div></div><hr />

To make money off the site? As the french would say &quot;Le Duh&quot;<br />
<br />
Shadowmourne news would generate more traffic than Background downloader and a couple of blue post news.<br />
Why he wouldn't say who the new LK is? Well that would probably kill any source he would have is my guess<br />

Um the downloading only started this week so how can any email telling you about the downloader be 2 or 3 days old? That would mean you got the emails today. So that doesnt work sorry. I even posted a forum post about the lack of mentioning of the downloader.
