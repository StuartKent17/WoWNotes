3:10 to Thunder Bluff: New Ways of Travel<br />
In the next major content patch we will be adding a few methods of improved transportation to areas of interest while leveling.<br />
<br />
It is time for the denizens of Azeroth to witness the full might of the Horde as they do what they do best: employ goblins to construct zeppelin towers and float players across vast seas using sky boats. That's right, a new zeppelin route is being added in Thunder Bluff and will transport players to Orgrimmar. Isn't technology magnificent?<br />
<br />
Also, brought to you by Azeroth's greatest users of magic, are all new portals coming to Stormwind and Orgrimmar. These portals will transport players directly to the Stair of Destiny at the Dark Portal. Travel is just so much more convenient when it's instantaneous! Players will then find that a new connecting flight path exists at the Stair of Destiny allowing players new to Outland easy and direct access to the city of Shattrath.<br />
<br />
Keep your seat backs and tray tables in a full upright and locked position, and we hope you continue to enjoy your methods of travel in Azeroth and beyond!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or any sort of faster connection between the Eastern Kingdoms and Darn or Exodar. My alt rogue is getting really annoyed about having to take 20-30 minutes out of leveling just to get to the jewelcrafting trainer. Something that could get us there a little easier than the single boat from SW would be excellent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think its silly. People should travel to shat first before having the flight path connect directly to it. I mean, why bother discovering flight paths at all anymore? Might as well just give all new players them, without any effort involved. I mean, i have quite a few alts, played through outlands a lot and its not exactly hard or that time consuming riding to shat once to get the flight path.<br />
<br />
The other changes are nice though and the portal directly to the stairs of destiny is great (especially for horde).<br />
<br />
I'm still surprised they haven't added a flightpath connecting to Exodar. Theres a reason why most people use the flight path from Auberdine to Darn and not the boat, convenience.</div></div><hr />

They're goblins. They care about profit. Which is cheaper: Digging a long tunnel through rocky, mountainous terrain and installing a very sophisticated system to make use of said tunnel, or building another wooden tower that their already-in-service zepplins can just start stopping by every so often?</div></div><hr />

This is really ridiculous. I did like the mount changes, but this is just over the top.<br />
<br />
It has absolutely no lore background why just anyone such as our characters should have direct access to the gate. It's stupid. Why even have the Dark Portal in Azeroth now? I still remember the epic feeling when I first went through the gate and arrived on the enormous portal on the other side. Why do even Horde mages have the portal to Stonard now?<br />

Next up: Portals in every city that spit you out at any flight path or summoning stone. I bet someone will find a lore loop-hole for that too.<br />

<br />
Because you know...there aren't 3-4 portals at the base of the stairs constantly bringing in reinforcements from the Alliance cities amirite?<br />
<br />
And the portal to Stonard allows easier access to Karazhan for mount farming. At least it's better than a portal to theramore, which is completely and utterly away from anything useful (other than Ony).<br />
<br />
The only REAL REAL REAL change I would LOVE is some kind of portal/blimp/whatever to feralas/silithus, or hell, something to feralas and then LINK feralas to silithus.<br />
<br />
10+ min flight paths are freaking retarded (auberdine/theramore -&gt; feralas)</div></div><hr />

Ya. The low passenger count means that Blizz will never be able to recoup the cost of the lumber alone in building the airship. Labor costs alone for the cost of the pilot will make that low volume flight unprofitable...<br />

I think it's just money Blizz will never recoup, adding this new blimp route. The passenger numbers will never add up...<br />

It isn't so you can go hang out in TB easier, it's so the level 10s don't have to spend 2 hours avoiding level 30 mobs, running back to their corpse, etc through the barrens in order to get to Org. No other race in the game has anywhere near the hassle tauren have in that situation.<br />
<br />
2 - Just stop crying. If you're 80, none of this effects you in the least. If you're leveling an alt, it's great for you! If you're a new player, it's great for you! I don't see the negative aspects.</div></div><hr />

And the portal to Stonard allows easier access to Karazhan for mount farming. At least it's better than a portal to theramore, which is completely and utterly away from anything useful (other than Ony).<br />

Ah, did not know you obtained both of those so early, makes a lot more sense. Easy to get to ST for horde (not sure about the questing in SoS)...and I guess theramore is alright for that level range for questing, probably a whole crapload better with mounts, as running around the lake 50 times to go between Tabetha's and theramore was obnoxious as hell (yes I know there's a FP on that side of the lake now....dustshallow still sucks).</div></div><hr />

the recamped SoS are awesome for alliance! i lvled all my recent alts there. its organized like the qhubs in bc, which means more streamlined and efficient questing. i seriously recommend going there at lvl 35 and skipping a lot of STV. if you are like me and have just lvled too many alts for STV to b still enjoyable, then go to SoS or Desolace for a fresher experience.</div></div><hr />

I don't envy the new players that they'll have a portal straight to The Dark Portal. I feel sorry for them. They'll miss out on the epic feeling and the excitement of heading to the portal for the first time when they reach lvl58. The huge crater. The first step through... oh the memories.<br />
<br />
Sure, they can choose not to use the city portal, but that's not the point here. The portal itself removes the whole special feeling of the trip into Outland. For instance, it feels more rewarding to get to a top of a mountain when you know it takes some effort to get there. The moment you see a helicopter lifting people straight to the top, your trip is devalued because you realize you could have taken the chopper all along. But then again while you didn't know about the helicopter, the trip felt like something special, which is something the people who always knew about the chopper never experienced.<br />

Are you dumb or something? <br />
What if you already 70 and port to org? There are 2 options, HS, or pay mage to make portal for you. During BC my HS was almost on Shatt all the time because i knew how hard it was to get back there from Org AH.Well there was an drop party instance exploit but it aint working anymore.

<br />
Ironforge has a tram to Stormwind. Stormwind has a boat to Auberdine which has boats to Exodar and Darnassus and vise versa.<br />
<br />
On the horde side there is a teleport between Undercity and Silvermoon, and a Zepplin between Org and UC. But Thunderbluff had no connections. People leveling taurens had to do the horde version of the wetlands walk all the way to Org. and it sucked badly.<br />
<br />
As for the teleports between org and the stairs, I think its a good idea. Going all the way out to Blasted Lands to use the dark portal didn't increase the players expirience at all. <br />
<br />
I dont think new players should get a flight path to Shat. when they 1st enter Outlands though. In 3.2 they will have the ability to fly at 150% flying speed. The added actually lowers newcomers expirience because then they get to Shatt. and will have no idea how to get to where they need to go to quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My views on this change are meh, i like it for alts and for the newbies, but tiz all good, i can keep my head held high and say, &quot; ha! i got it when it was expensive and not just a give away&quot; lol, also i remember when you had to pay 90g for 60% mount, and 10g for the training, those were the good ol' days =D<br />
<br />
In terms to the TB --&gt; Org Zep, i think it could of been better placed, like a TB zep to both UC and ORG. But that's cus im currently leveling my dru dru =D<br />

My only complaint is that they should of fixed exodar along time ago, yet it still isnt on the list.<br />
horde can connect SMC to Eastern Kingdoms flightpaths via Zul'aman and plagues, so why cant exo get connected via Auberdine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not possible until Blizz merge (some) BC content into vanila WoW.<br />
<br />
I still think that on that front Blizz is doing it wrong! Both Blood Elf and Draenai starting place along with jewelcrafting and inscription should be merged into vannila game with their proper profesion limits (300)! <br />
<br />
That way all players could use flight masters to fly to Silvermoon and Exodar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has absolutely no lore background why just anyone such as our characters should have direct access to the gate. <br />
<br />
Actually there IS a lore background. From the day BC launched there were two portals at the stair of destiny leading from Orgimmar and Stormwind. Every so often an NPC would come running out of them. Really these portals should have been available since day one, but they were left out to encourage the majority of the player base to go through blasted lands and experience going through the gate.<br />
<br />
For a similar reason there is no portal directly to dalaran. Blizzard wants players to do the quests that take you there, experiencing the lore of Northrend.<br />
<br />
The idea about this is to help new characters catch up with the rest of the existing player base. As experienced players we don't know how hard it is to start this game on a server that's been around for a while. There is literally NO ONE to level with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I'm not sorry to see them go. Get with the times, things are changing. This is not vanilla WOW where the level cap is 60, you had a smaller player base and everyone had to group up to fight the elites for everything. It's evolved. If it didn't you wouldn't have a WOW to play today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is something which i sometimes love about wow/blizz, why didnt they just do that with the wind rider route you mentioned? cuz its boring, and a zepp tower is way more fun than the wind rider.<br />
<br />
The tram is a lot cooler and unique than a zepp tower though, we have loads of em. <br />
<br />
I'd love to see a mining shaft kind of tunnel with goblins working in it, traveling through in some sort of underground railroad train device kind of thing, maybe even with a couple of holes in it, for example in the barrens, with an midway station, or just a hole for some daylight and great view.<br />
<br />
These kinds of things are fun to explore, play with, and is one of the things that makes this game great.<br />
<br />
Yes, im sure the tram in SW/IF gets dull after a while, but when its new, its awesome, people love it, when it gets old, people are still facinated about it, and it would be loads of fun for both alliance and horde. <br />
<br />
(infiltrating IF/SW as horde through the tram, kill people down there, and escape through it, is still laods of fun.)</div></div><hr />

Well, there was no boat to Auberdine from SW before SW harbor came, before that all Night Elves (and Draenei after TBC) had to take a boat from auberdine to wetlands and walk to IF to acces the other cities.<br />
So what really would have been beteer if they had released the TB&lt;--&gt;Org Zeppelin in WotLK along with SW harbor to make it fair:)<br />
I really like this change because of that, makes it even :) <br />
And I really enjoy the Mount changes too, maybe I can arse myself to level up my Druid and Rogue from 20-ish and up to 60(then I'll hit outlands and stop just like with the warrior and DK xD)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chiper</div><div class="date">2009-06-11, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing I miss about vanilla WoW was that there were always more people leveling characters and running low level instances. Once you hit 60 there was nothing to do but farm or grind Scholo/Strat/DM for your Tier .5 while waiting for whatever raid your guild was running. A lot more people were leveling alts and there was always a pool of low level characters wanting to do instances or group up for quests. Players learned group dynamics at level 17 when they entered Deadmines for the first time.<br />
<br />
Today there is SO MUCH content to continue doing after you hit 80 that there are a lot fewer reasons to level an alt. You can level to 80 without even entering Storm Peaks or Sholozar, so you've got all those quests still available. Then you have 30-40 daily quests to choose from, a dozen heroics, Wintergrasp, new BGs, Arenas, the Argent Tournament and puggable 10 man raids. Who has time to level alts?<br />
<br />
The pre-level 60 zones are ghost towns. You can spend hours questing and never even see another player. Most players don't even bother trying to get groups for non-northrend instances; it's easier to just ask a guild mate to spend 20 minutes to run you through. New players don't even learn how to instance until they enter northrend (in BC it was hellfire). I've been in pugs where people actually didn't know what group loot was.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is right, vanilla content has become a single player game. The only options now are to help speed people through that game and catch up. These changes aren't causing the problem, they're trying to fix it.</div></div><hr />

My, people still play in those brackets? Thought after that enchanting change they would be pretty much dead, now that you can't &quot;cheat&quot; your char to like twice the HP others have normally at that level. ::)</div></div><hr />

These portals will transport players directly to the Stair of Destiny at the Dark Portal. Travel is just so much more convenient when it's instantaneous! Players will then find that a new connecting flight path exists at the Stair of Destiny allowing players new to Outland easy and direct access to the city of Shattrath.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is really ridiculous. I did like the mount changes, but this is just over the top.<br />
<br />
It has absolutely no lore background why just anyone such as our characters should have direct access to the gate. It's stupid. Why even have the Dark Portal in Azeroth now? I still remember the epic feeling when I first went through the gate and arrived on the enormous portal on the other side. Why do even Horde mages have the portal to Stonard now?<br />
<br />
Next up: Portals in every city that spit you out at any flight path or summoning stone. I bet someone will find a lore loop-hole for that too.<br />
<br />
It's silly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you go to the gate, you'll notice four mages. Two blood elves and two gnomes. The blood elf mages have been holding up a gate from Orgrimmar ever since the release of The Burning Crusade, and the gnomes have been holding up a portal from Stormwind. Shouldn't it be fair that us players would also be able to use these portals and not just the NPCs? Of course if you want that epic feeling, then you can use the gate. These portals are just for more practical use ;)</div></div><hr />

But seriously, I thought just the mount changes were awesome, but they really know what they're doing, screw giving us more Exp per quest and mob, just make it faster, we still see all the zones in whatever order we please but we do it faster than ever, god knows Tanaris and EPL needed epic mounts when you were on your way to Outlands but not quite there yet..</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, it just seems... very bleh, IMO. Sure, 240 static AP is nice, but Fury of the Five Flights beats it depending on how long the encounter is and whether you can maintain the stack count (obviously if you can't maintain it, Comet's Trail blows it out of the water).<br />
<br />
I'd still rather have Dark Matter over Comet's Trail though.<br />
<br />
Edit: Yup, modeling Comet's Trail in Shandara's spreadsheet with the same rules as Dark Matter follows (15% procrate, 45s ICD), Comet's Trail is 28 DPS behind Dark Matter and 8 DPS behind Darkmoon Card: Greatness.<br />

2 - Just stop crying. If you're 80, none of this effects you in the least. If you're leveling an alt, it's great for you! If you're a new player, it's great for you! I don't see the negative aspects.<br />
<br />
<br />
1- You can just level up? You don't even need the orgrimmar flight path before you can actually get there without dieing because mobs are 20 levels higher...<br />

I think this change is welcome. I've got a 71 Tauren and it is a nice change. Sure, at level 10ish you're sent into the Barrens. But what about those Tauren who wish to go to Org/UC/SMC for reasons that are their own? I think this is a very good change, and will increase the number of Tauren players :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still occasionally go to Shatt and it's faster to take the Dalaran portal than run around all over Azeroth just to get to the BL for the portal. Having one in Org means I can get there that much faster now. No more going from where ever I might be to get to Swamp of Sorrows to navigate through Blasted Lands to get to the portal to fly to Shatt. Cut out all that trip wasting time getting to the Portal is nothing to gripe about.</div></div><hr />

If it takes you 2 hours to run a level 10 character through the Barrens (where there aren't really any level 30 random mobs, BTW) to get to or from Thunder Bluff, you have to be the worst / stupidest player in the history of the game.<br />

And for some of us we don't even benefit from it! I got 6 characters level 70+ (3 are 80), another in it's 60s.. and the final 3 are below 30. Those 3 I gotta be desperately bored to start on.

You people need to relax. ZOMG!!! They are making travel time go down. Well good. That helps a lot of us, since I am married, have 2 kids, and in the Army. I enjoy to get my WoW on just as much as the next person. Taking away a ton of travel time is one of the best decisions Blizzard can do for us with lives outside of WoW.<br />
