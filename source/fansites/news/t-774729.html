Mounts and Items Removed in 4.0.3<br />
As stated in the Under Dev page (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/), patch 4.0.3 brings about The Shattering, a cataclysmic event that will forever change the face of Azeroth. As we prepare to raise the level cap and introduce two new races with the Cataclysm expansion, it's important to keep in mind that the game world is going through tremendous changes that will affect the availability of certain rare mounts and items.<br />
<br />
Swift Zulian Tiger<br />
Zul'Gurub is changing from a raid to a leveling zone in 4.0.3, and this mount will no longer be obtainable.<br />
<br />
Swift Razzashi Raptor<br />
This mount will also no longer be obtainable after the change to Zul'Gurub.<br />
<br />
Razzashi Hatchling<br />
With the change to Zul'Gurub this non-combat pet will no longer be obtainable.<br />
<br />
Tome of Polymorph: Turtle http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage<br />
This tome will continue to be available through other means.<br />
<br />
Crusader's White/Black Warhorse and Swift Alliance Steed/Swift Horde Wolf<br />
As the attempt-based tribute system is being removed from Heroic Trial of the Crusader, the Argent Crusade Tribute Chest will no longer spawn, and these mounts will no longer be obtainable<br />
<br />
Reins of the Blue Drake<br />
This mount will once again be available from defeating 10-player Malygos without needing to use the Dungeon Finder. The Reins of the Azure Drake will only be available on 25-player Malygos.<br />
<br />
Mimiron's Head<br />
This mount will change to be a very low drop chance when defeating 25-player Yogg'Saron with no Keepers assisting you<br />
<br />
Invincible<br />
This mount will change to be a very low drop chance when defeating Heroic 25-player Lich King<br />
<br />
Although we have no current plans to introduce new ways to obtain the Zul'Gurub mounts, pets, and the tribute mounts, they may return should we find a place where they fit in the future. <br />
<br />
<br />
TiVo Alert: Cataclysm TV Spot Debuts 10/17<br />
Now I guess that explains why the files are encrypted. <br />
<br />
This Sunday, during the Dallas Cowboys versus Minnesota Vikings NFL game on Fox (starts at 4:15 PM EDT, 1:15 PM PDT), we are debuting a new television commercial for World of Warcraft's upcoming expansion. The commercial will feature the first look at cinematic footage from Cataclysm, so tune in to an exciting game this Sunday and catch the new commercial!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
MLG DC is coming this Friday!<br />
Major League Gaming's tournament series continues as MLG Washington DC 2010 fires things up this Friday, October 15th, starting at 5:00 PM EST.<br />
<br />
For World of Warcraft arena, top teams will be fighting for their places in the upcoming MLG National Championships. This is the final event of the season, and will determine where these teams are seeded at the MLG National Championships.<br />
<br />
On the StarCraft II front, 64 of the best players, including luminaries like MLG Raleigh's champion HuK, as well as IdrA, White-Ra, TLO and iNControl, will compete for $7500 in cash prizes as well as MLG Rank Points to determine their placement in the National Championships taking place in Dallas next month.<br />
<br />
You can catch it all streamed live at (http://www.mlgpro.com), including both standard def and HD options. If you live in the area, this would also be a great time to pick up passes for MLG Dallas (http://www.mlgpro.com/store/product.php?pid=143), happening on Nov 5th - 7th. The National Championship event is the culmination of the MLG 2010 season for StarCraft II, with $17,500 in prizes on the line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit: also, kinda surprised about the Razzashi Hatchling pet.... I figured that there'd be other raptors put into the leveling area that lowbies could kill, and they'd have the low droprate chance of the pet. But removal altogether?

If they are stupid why do you care? And yes, you missed the post as well as the dozens of comments on that post.<br />

I say though because I think for obvious reasons DK's should be the most representative class in terms of gear looks in Wrath with its connection to the final boss. Here, it seems like Deathwing best represented (in what we've seen so far) in the DK gear too. Wouldn't shammys represent the sundering of the world and rise of elements better? I guess, since I have both a DK and a shammy I was hopping for some cooler gear for the latter..<br />
<br />
And meh, been saving my Turtle polymorph tomes since I read ZG would be removed as a raid. Guess I can just try to sell them on AH now before everyone reads the blue post...<br />

Mixing a hunter T8 helm with T7 shoulders, that was really a problem explaining how the hell one could move the head. Best clipping ever!</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has said a few times they are not getting removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I never understood why they can't just remove mount without all the fuss. Doesn't that make a mount so much greater?

And yes the DK set looks FREAKING AWESOME.<br />
<br />
Cool Mount does not mean 2 or 3 people have it and ONLY them. :/ No mount should EVER be removed from game (if only to irritate people who think they are gods and special snowflakes) but seriously. No one is going to care about them once they get the next awesome mount down the road. <br />
<br />
It will sit in their tab collecting dust and NEVER used. Do you ever SEE A battle tank? (Dumbest mount in game imo since only ONE person had it) people don't need recognition in a game. They need that in REAL life where it might actually you know MATTER for something. &gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />

The helm looks like a funky jumbo-sized joker from a deck of cards that had an unfortunate accident with Diablo.<br />
To make matters worse, we have the same damn thing on both shoulders. Ugh. The helm would be better if it was smaller and the shoulders were different. Or gone completely.<br />
<br />
Just not feeling it at all. One of the worst T11 previews seen thus far. Too much fire and earth tones. Or neon, which is just... *shudder* I am disappointed.<br />

On the other hand, really glad one of my 'mains' has the ZG mount and pet.</div></div><hr />

It's a good thing we are getting a heap more mounts in Cataclysm. Just too bad that those people who tried their luck and never got the tiger or raptor will probably never get them. I've tried for them a little, but nothing compared to the hardcore tiger and raptor farmers.</div></div><hr />

It will sit in their tab collecting dust and NEVER used. Do you ever SEE A battle tank? (Dumbest mount in game imo since only ONE person had it) people don't need recognition in a game. They need that in REAL life where it might actually you know MATTER for something. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Er, you have literally 100+ other mounts for that purpose.<br />
<br />
Why do you want stuff like Incvincible and Mimiron's Head? Oh yea, BECAUSE THEY'RE RARE AND HARD TO GET.<br />
<br />
If they gave them out to everyone that wanted them, no one would want them anymore and they'd collect dust in the mount tab.<br />

Removing certain mounts and items is a GOOD thing. There are TONS of other non-removed items and mounts to keep you busy vs. the few that were actually removed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shadow Priests – we lowered the damage of Shadow Word: Death, except when the target is at the 20% wounded state, at which point it will do full damage. We also fixed a bug where the energize from Masochism was causing too much threat. (This is just a clarification on the above note -- we have not nerfed it twice.) <br />

Balance Druids – we lowered the base points and coefficients of several Balance spells, especially Insect Swarm. <br />

Once Cataclysm is live, outside of getting your XP frozen at 80 how do you intend to get INTO an instance of Oculus that today would give you a chance at that mount?

<br />
<br />
My guess is some sort of dismounting attack that doesn't (on it's own) kill you, or maybe even hurt you that much, but knocks you off your mount. Which is probably hurtful or fatal depending on height.<br />
<br />
Much as Combat Rogues are sucking right now and as cool as this set is, my DK may be my new main :-)<br />
<br />
Edit to add:<br />
<br />

While it doesn't explicitly say it odds are the bag will be removed as there will be no need to give people incentive to run a dungeon they will no longer get as a random.<br />
More to the point the bag only drops in random Heroic Occulus attempts. How many people are going to be doing random LK Heroics at 85? At most you'll do two or three while level through 80-81. The chances of getting Occulus are pretty slim. It's not like you can just keep going into Occulus to farm the thing, It's RNG to even get the right instance in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Technically, it does. They are not going to add it back to Maly-10 if they were leaving in in Oculus.<br />
<br />
Once you level past the mid-80s, possibly sooner, you can no longer do Oculus through the random dungeon finder. Which means you can't get the nifty little lootsack that had a chance to contain the Blue Drake. People complained about this, so they removed the Blue Drake from said lootsack and put it back as a random drop from Maly-10, where it dropped from in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Saving 1 book for sure and probably 2 just in case they move the polymorph turtle to a quest or a vendor. Due to how it was obtained before I would suspect it could sell from a set vendor for maybe 250-500g.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will sit in their tab collecting dust and NEVER used. Do you ever SEE A battle tank? (Dumbest mount in game imo since only ONE person had it) people don't need recognition in a game. They need that in REAL life where it might actually you know MATTER for something. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Actually the Armani War Bear is the coolest mount right now (and it still will be in the future) simply due to the fact that it could not be obtained after patch 3.0. Same goes for the BC raid titles. In a couple of years no one will give a ish about Wotlk mounts and titles but the BC ones will still be recognized (at least by the ones that know what BC is).</div></div><hr />

Maybe for you. O_o; I HATE that mount it is the ugliest thing I have ever seen. LOL No offence but uh I don't technically see the need to have something totally unique and &quot;Special&quot; in a game. It is going to end one day, and when it does you can't take it with you. Outside of any RL friend's that might play the game ... no one will give two shits about any &quot;rare&quot; thing earned in a video game. There for making it absolutely pointless to make things exclusive for a select group of people.<br />
<br />
Blizzard works hard to make nice mounts, and its rather silly to allow only a hand full of people to &quot;earn&quot; it then remove it from game. Those people quit and then oh hey, all that hard work for nothing. No one sees it, and most of the time no one cares that person has it on the simple grounds that THEY don't have one as well. I think mounts should stay in game so that they can be earned and serve the actual purpose they were placed in to start with. To be USED and road from point A to point B.</div></div><hr />

So you don't want there to be exclusive difficult to obtain rewards for anyone and therefore have nothing to pursue for the better players? Interesting, you must be accustomed to low end gameplay and are content getting out exactly what you put into the game (nothing).</div></div><hr />

<br />
i agree however. i dont want them to take away the tiger, i want it and it looks cool imo. however, i doubt if i grind it i will get it. a friend of mine has been working on it for months and still hasnt gotten it. there is so much to do in this game that it is hard to know what you should grind for at times. it would be nice if there was an alternative to removing the items they are removing...like giving a way to grind out earning the tiger.<br />
