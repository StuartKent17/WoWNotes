Blue Tweets<br />
World<br />
Don't you think big reason people stuck in capitals instead of exploring world is absence of LFG and Trade channels?<br />
In Cat? No. They had no need to chat with anyone because they could random queue for all the gear they'd need. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/342527592756281344))<br />
We'd be willing to try a global LFG channel again, but I think you'd be buried in (ahem) anal spells and Chuck Norris jokes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/342527851687464960))<br />
you say in CAT, but all the queues for heroic dungeons and LFR etc are still here. Yes, we have more dailies.<br />
But you can earn things like valor or charms by going out into the world. Dungeons and raids don't deliver every single reward. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/342531864017395712))<br />
<br />
Disagree. CRZ puts several servers worth of griefers into one zone, causes zone disruption. leveling becomes impossible.<br />
We aim to combine enough realms with CRZ to make each feel full. If there are a lot of folks around, that is kind of the goal. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340956322927362049))<br />
That was the intended and often real experience when more folks were leveling and the pop wasn't so skewed to max level. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340956447024230400))<br />
<br />
Are you really trying to say that having cross-server 90s camping all low level zones is the intended experience?<br />
That wasn't what I said. I was remarking that you seemed surprised to have players attack you while leveling on a PvP server. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340909835367358464))<br />
<br />
So GC, the all-faction multi-tap is nice, but i still got an issue (http://i.imgur.com/nxFjPSU.jpg). Could you see a future solution?<br />
We're not big fans of all-faction tap overall. You should be angry that a Horde tapped your mob! (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339934045674815488))<br />
What about on PVE servers where that just makes it a pointless race? I want to play -with- my peers, not against them.<br />
If you are Alliance, Horde are not your peers. At most you should consider them a tool to be used, then discarded. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339997443359899649))<br />
care to explain why we're not burning org to the ground and slaughtering orc women and children in 5.4 then?<br />
You can be enemies without resorting to genocide. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340195577415495680))<br />
<br />
Aren't profession catch-up mechanisms against goal of &quot;making the world feel populated&quot;? Why visit old world if not for AH?<br />
We want players out in the world. That doesn't have to mean high level characters in low level zones. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339925556697116672))<br />
You want to take away reasons for 90s to visit lowbie zones? Players would be missing out; an excuse like AH gets us to visit.<br />
What we have typically seen up until now is those players just don't level up their professions. It's not worth going back. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340000722366115840))<br />
<br />
Many players hate CRZ - are you absolutely sure, game needs it?<br />
Yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339059169707585536))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Trivia: Kalgan single-handedly made almost all of the vanilla talent trees. Trivia: Kalgan still leads the team. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/339933492509028353))<br />
<br />
why do so many long time players (me included) feel BC was the best xpac even though it was the least accessible?<br />
I suspect because even basic elements of WoW still felt new and shiny then. Even the best things in life aren't immune from fatigue (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343806478244786177))<br />
Players say they like a certain expansion, but what Blizzard wants to know is WHY they like that expansion?<br />
True. But often the answer is &quot;Those were the glory days of WoW for me,&quot; which is hard to recreate with just new content. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/343804112720252929))<br />
<br />
He's worried that the Alliance in 5.4 will just be along for the ride while the Horde gets all the glory.<br />
I understand the concern, but it's one of those no-win battles for us. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340000995612442624))<br />
Red &amp; Blue are both certain that the other gets special treatment. But as I said, a lil' Red v Blue rivalry aint bad. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340001218942337024))<br />
<br />
with features such as LFR people have a 'log on, dailies, LFR, log off' attitude now, this is where I lost my ingame friends<br />
Yeah it's a tough thing to solve, because that play style works very well with some people's real life commitments. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338362395456073728))<br />
<br />
Some way to regain the lost sense of server community would help. Right now we only play with guildies and random strangers.<br />
I think that is well put especially the second sentence. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338364018999844865))<br />
<br />
even a 'history' of party members would help: &quot;you grouped with X,Y,Z in yesterday's dungeon and X is online now&quot;<br />
Totally. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338362764701622273))<br />
<br />
Any chance of toning down other players spell effects on boss encounters, or having a setting for that. Can hardly see boss!<br />
Yes. Working on it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337306815824015360))<br />
<br />
Two things that the forum posting / tweeting community tend to overestimate: number of multiboxers, number of players interested in raiding. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333297545390473216))<br />
Not sure if it's an echo chamber effect or if posters / tweeters tend to be hardcore or what. Just an observation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333297774609182720))<br />
<br />
Suit Up collapsed. Exodus collapsed. I've been in 3 25 mans this tier, all have collapsed. Please do something.<br />
My understanding was that Exodus did not &quot;collapse&quot; from a 10 v 25 issue. Is that what you're implying? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335792198442418176))<br />
They're not collapsing from 10 vs 25 issues. Burnout is happening, less raiders are around and 10s result. Or they disband.<br />
They put in 100s of attempts and demand multiple fully geared alts per player. That's not something most heroic raiders deal with. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336248433335742464))<br />
it was my understanding in their interview it was their own fault that type of gameplay was too much to bear.<br />
I wasn't trying to blame them if that was the impression I gave. I think it's just the natural evolution of the competition. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336600278600138753))<br />
<br />
Curious, After we goto Argus next expac (wink) theres no more wow zones in lore to give us.Redoing old zones the expac future?<br />
You don't think we can keep whipping continents out of thin air? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335791795730522113))<br />
<br />
Span and Port are diff lang. Why put them both in Chi Data Cntr? US servers there now have to deal w/ 2 lang barriers. Why?<br />
I don't know in this case. Usually it is to have a large enough group to support matchmaking. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335802686672891905))<br />
<br />
If Players want old school: aka no lfr, flying, w/e, Is worth trying a new realm type for old school? pvp/rp/pve/&quot;classic&quot;.<br />
No LFR and flying wouldn't be too hard. Going back to old talents, weapon skill, old quests would be very hard. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335800725407928321))<br />
<br />
Voice com. required turns me off. Would love a challenge and not put on headphones,rand-bgs are getting there <br />
Yeah, that's a tough challenge for gaming in general. Typing is just really slow. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/340958956044300290))<br />
<br />
Do you think you should publicly announce when bots have been banned. It will show the system works and might deter botting.<br />
I think the head on a pike strategy can work as a deterrent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335798623822561280))<br />
<br />
SWTOR got random groups correct. It is server based. Server based leads to accountability.<br />
Realm based groups would have a very long queue time, especially on off-peak hours. How long are you willing to wait? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333299698284773377))<br />

<br />
If you're on 10-man, I'm hoping you'veb een working on other bosses first (ie. Ju-Kin and Iron Qon for example) to gear up a bit. They're significantly easier than Horridon, it may help your progress quite a bit later on :)<br />
<br />
As for the Priest-set: <br />
It looks great with the graphics, I'm contemplating the transmog. On the other hand, it would be great if MMO-C would do priest sets the way they look in Shadowform as well, same they did with the CM set in the beta coverage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having down Horridon on the first day of 5.2 &amp; watching it nerfed initially (which was expected), a nerf this late isn't really not needed tho, I believe more people are having problems on normal Tortos then Horridon or are people still wiping tons on Normal Horridon?</div></div><hr />

Tyrael doesn't have a class per se; Tyrael is simply an Archangel, which is kinda fitting for Priests.</div></div><hr />

We stacked at Horridon about 4 weeks ago, our guild collapsed after 179 wipe on that boss, because our guild master enraged. He plays GW2 with their friends...</div></div><hr />

I play SWTOR every once in a while (especially now during their 3 weekends of double xp). They have less subs/players than WoW and my instance queue as DPS is just as long (maybe a little shorter) than WoW whom uses all servers when making a group.<br />

<br />
If you're speaking about Normal mode (which I'll assume, as that's what the nerf was to) I don't think it's a bring the class fight at all. At least, not in my guild's experience. We've got up to Megaera on farm (Megaera is an easy kill if our A-team healers are there for raid). We did hit a brick wall with Horridon, but frankly, every boss this tier has felt that way. We shuffle folks from our bench in regularly, and we're certainly no &quot;hardcore raiding,&quot; guild.<br />
<br />
So no, I'd argue it's not a bring the class fight. Is it a chaotic fight? Absolutely. 1st door is largely insignificant. Gurubashi door isn't bad if you mark the priests firsts and assign interrupts. Third door? That's chaos. We always have lots of loose adds then--people just need to be patient, not panic, etc.<br />
<br />
ToT has felt extremely gear dependent--as we get more gear from crafteds and (occasionally) LFR, our performance greatly increases.<br />
<br />
My biggest frustration with the game has been the obscenely slow rate of gear acquisition for my guild. The same drops are dropping off the farmed bosses every week--and often with a mail agility drop, which is useless to our makeup. It's been weeks and on my rogue I'm still using LFR Spiritsever and LFR Megaera dagger. I use my coins every week trying to get a second dagger--no dice. It's frustrating knowing that we'll be in Orgrimmar and I'll still be trying to upgrade to current weapons. C'mon, blizz. Put weapon drops for weapon-dependent classes on the first three bosses, please. And bad loot protection is a pathetic joke--I've now gotten 4 leather agi shoulders off megaera rolls. Really? Come on.</div></div><hr />

No! Stop that! If you're going to have CRZ then only take people from that zone's leveling band! World PvP between players around the same level is fine, but when you have max levels running around killing at random its not. Easily solved problem, and the world will still feel 'full'.</div></div><hr />

The game wasn't designed to provide your own little questing and farming commune.

Except in Vanilla I played on a PvP server, which made it far more interesting.</div></div><hr />

I personally enjoy watching out for max level toons on my pvp server. Why roll on a pvp server if you don't enjoy the thrill of being a new toon that is just starting his journey as a beginner, you are essentially starting a weak, fresh character in a world full of people who are already badass and powerful? My first toon was on a pvp realm. Had no idea what I was doing and when level 80's came through with their badass gear and ganked me I was like OH MY GOD THAT WAS BADASS. <br />
<br />
You are forgetting that wow is an expansive world full of powerful heroes. That was what drew me to wow, the journey to become a powerful hero myself while getting smashed up by people who had already put in the time and dedication it takes to level a toon through a pvp server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's simply as you stated, overtuned. This leads it to 'feel' hard. In reality it's not hard, it's just people with low gear, low skill, or a combination of both.<br />
The raid is obviously intended for a much higher gear level than most people are walking into ToT with. Horridon being the second boss pretty much totally fucks anyone who gets stuck on him. Don't worry guys we can get some more gear during next weeks fa-- oh wait, the only farm boss is Jinrokh.<br />
With proper gear Horridon just melts, but if you're walking in there with a raid ilvl of anything less than 500 you're going to have a bad time unless you don't suck at the game, i.e an alt run.<br />
T16 seems to be fixing this issue, the first wing is tuned for 520 ilvl. You can get that without even trying these days.<br />
Each wing seems to increase by 5-10 ilvl in terms of tuning (Basing this off only 4 bosses), and the gear ilvl dropping is phenomenal. The raid should be much more widely cleared.</div></div><hr />

I am quite scared that because of Flex it might go the other way and normal's might be tuned higher.<br />

We are one of the guilds that got stuck on Horridon 3 weeks after our first kill (which took 10 weeks) we are now working on rampage 6 on Megaera which seems much nicer progress.<br />

<br />
They ignore those kinds of posts because they have stated their response to the &quot;issue&quot; of high level ganking long ago. It has been in the game from day 1 and will continue on. You roll on a pvp server, you'd better expect and accept it. Nothing stops you from getting on your main and fighting back or guarding other lowbies from attacks. Hell, I remember guilds actually organizing patrols in low level zones to protect their lowbies from gankers back in Vanilla, and some epic pvp usually tended to ensue.</div></div><hr />
