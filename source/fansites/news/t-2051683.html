Did you guys realize that in the beginning he holds it in the right way and he only turns it when he uses the shield part as a crusher? So basically he uses a weapon as effective as he can?</div></div><hr />

You could say that about most weapons to be fair.<br />
<br />
I bet it would go wrong faster if most people on this forum tried doing it with a Kusarigama for example. Yet its a real weapon.<br />
<br />
Special weapons like this have a special fighting style that needs to be practised before actual &quot;field&quot; use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well might be used like Chakram in close combat with a further reach because of the blades on the side (good for blocking). but yeah bit to many curves for a &quot;Real&quot; weapon, if it head straight curved blades it would be more practicle like the one those guys had http://www.wowhead.com/npc=21179/demon-hunter-supplicant</div></div><hr />

It doesnt say 1000 times. It says 1000 degrees. As in the sun is 10000 degrees and the TIG welder is 11000 degrees<br />
<br />

:)<br />
<br />
You are right. I read it as its 1000 times hotter. Its stated the surface temp of the sun is 10,000 and the TIG puts out 11,000, so 1000 degrees hotter.<br />
<br />
My reading comprehension failed me.</div></div><hr />

(well its not really heavy, the problem is to swing it for long time or not loose balance but with just this its out of the question except if youre ~50+ kg) dont make it like its hard or you really need to do some sports :D<br />
The problem with the warglaive is to not impale yourself with the other part of the weapon cuz these guys use it like a one way sword :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azobashi</div><div class="date">2016-08-19, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) to everyone saying he is holding it wrong: the handle they made is incredibly shitty. You can see as they move it how the warglaive actually rolls in their hand. Most of the &quot;improper&quot; holding is due to that single fact. Oh and the fact they have no idea how to use a warglaive, it's a weapon that use to be duel wielded for a reason. The other one served to help balance movement.<br />
2) everyone saying warglaives are impractical: tell that to all the very successful ones that were used in history. Obviously not as massive and intricate as the warglaives of azzinoth, but there were more basic ones used in history (think a handle that has 2 blades sticking out of it, one on each end of the handle). They are just INCREDIBLY hard to use and even harder master. Obviously something like the really cool intricate ones from WoW would never be useful, due to weight and just size, but warglaives are actually really cool and efficient once you know how to use them. The demon hunter supplicants from black temple have what a real warglaive would be. Wohead demon hunter supplicant and you can see a pic of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhhh no, it's impractical. Evidenced by the fact that no society, anywhere, used anything resembling war glaives.<br />

<br />
A bit smaller? A haladie is basically two daggers stuck together. A warglaive is exceptionally larger and heavier, meaning it'd be far too awkward to wield.</div></div><hr />

A haladie is basically two daggers stuck together. A warglaive is exceptionally larger and heavier, meaning it'd be far too awkward to wield.<br />
<br />
Foot long blades are pretty decent, considering that 2 feet are already a full shortsword. Warglaives in game are like 2 two foot blades, the thing alone is the size of a twohander.<br />
<br />
Haladie is pretty much the only wield-able option due to sheer weight issues.<br />
<br />
But never the less, a Warglaive would be completely impractical. They are just to big to be wielded onehanded, much less duel wielded. Infact in real life the biggest someone could duel wield would be a pair of small swords or daggers (or a full sword and a dagger). They could only be used as a two handed but at that point replacing a blade with a handle and making it a actual Glaive would be more effective.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Triptych</div><div class="date">2016-08-20, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was pretty entertaining. :)<br />
<br />
Which of course is the purpose. Y'all realise that it's not supposed to be a super serious real weapon, right? Just an 8 minute glimpse of some cool craft stuff, like making a flashy costume for BlizzCon.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shelly</div><div class="date">2016-08-20, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well they aint impractical the ppl just dont know how to use it in the right way . in the vid they used it like someone would use a shield with spikes.<br />
<br />
It's a 4.5' wide poorly balanced piece of metal with lots of pointy bits and sharp cutting edges. <br />
<br />
There is literally no way to use it &quot;the right way&quot; meaning as used in game. As well as the ones in game are impractical and used in such a way that they'd be ineffective against anyone with a shield. <br />
<br />
Follow the KISS rule (Keep It Simple Stupid) if glaive type weapons of the two blades on a stick were easy and practical to use then they'd be used by all cultures all over the place. <br />
<br />
Also anything that weighs 20# is just going to be crazy to try and use for anything more than a minute or two one handed. Most swords weigh about 5# if they are steel, a similarly sized bronze sword weighs at least twice as much. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm now stoked with hope that next week we'll see the Ashbringer. I'm really surprised they did the Warglaive(s), even if I shouldn't be, just because Swatton's work on shields hasn't been too impressive.</div></div><hr />

The problem with having only one of them, is that you have no balance because you are supposed to spin with them together to create a counterforce to the centrifugal force that would otherwise throw you off balance. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</div></div><hr />
