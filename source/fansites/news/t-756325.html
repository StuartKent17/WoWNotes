Leveling makes you &quot;weaker&quot; in Cataclysm<br />
Your primary stats go up, but your combat ratings go down. The reason for this is that those ratings convert to percentages. If you started with say 50% crit chance, and then gained a level and your new gear had say +4% crit chance instead of +2% crit chance, then you'd quickly get to 100% crit and stay there. This was the reason we implemented combat ratings in the first place. (You can blame Blackhand's Breadth.)<br />
<br />
This particularly gets to be a problem when you reach max level. The reason is because you are going to go through several tiers of gear without increasing your character level, so we need to have enough space in the numbers for them to increase. We figure out what the highest say crit and haste chance the game can handle and then work backwards giving each tier a meaningful upgrade (or getting new gear won't be fun) and that determines the combat ratings on the starting gear.<br />
<br />
We definitely understand the confusion / weird perception issues this causes and we've talked about some ways to completely revamp the game's combat equations so that we didn't need to use percentage-based stats influenced by ratings with diminishing returns. That is too large a change for Cataclysm, but something we might do in the future (when we aren't also tackling talent and glyph revamps).<br />
<br />
Also remember that if you are leveling to 85, you are skipping over a lot of potential quest rewards that you can't get yet. The item leaps among levels are pretty large at level 80-85, which we had to do to make the upgrades feel meaningful. (Imagine the alternatives where you could go to Twilight Highlands directly from Icecrown and do okay.) Once those quest items are in, you'll be more powerful as you level. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726032498/warriors-12857/))<br />
<br />
Tuning abilities numbers<br />
A lot of you are focusing on numbers, which are just such easy things to tweak at this stage that we haven't turned our attention to them yet. If a &quot;fun&quot; ability for you is synonymous with &quot;one that hits hard&quot; then what you find fun is liable to be random and switch from build to build. :)<br />
<br />
We have adjusted mob health and damage quite a bit in the beta and we're going to continue to do so. In LK, quest mobs got to be a bit of a joke, such that everyone was used to killing clouds of them with ease. We're trying to return to a world where you can generally handle one, but might want to think about using some of your crowd control or emergency buttons when you get an extra one or two. (Again, that's the intent. We're still adjusting things to get there.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560570771/paladin-changes-for-build-12857-08-31-10/))<br />
<br />
Uldum and Twilight Highlands are hard!<br />
Unfortunately, this is the most salient point in the original post. :( Everything from mana cost to tank damage are designed around having the correct gear. Doing an 85 zone in 83 gear is much, much harder than doing a 75 zone in 73 gear. Why? Because with only 5 levels, we made the level to level jump in item stats really high. That also means mobs also jump up a lot in power from level 73 to 75.<br />
<br />
Almost every &quot;Wow, things are hard&quot; thread I have read on this and other forums are a direct result of not having Uldum and Twilight gear yet. We thought long and hard about whether it was a good idea to bump the level cap without that gear in place. In the end, we thought it was worth getting feedback on the quest design and some of the encounter design. But encounter balance is enormously dependent on having the right gear. Just keep that in mind. Things will feel better when you have ugrades available. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725672943/lvl85-h-paladin-numbers-abilities-thread/))<br />
<br />
Healing throughput<br />
Throughput won't go up enormously, but it will go up. Regen will go up. Most importantly, tank health and total dps will go up a lot. You won't be able to top anyone off in a GCD, but nobody will die so quickly that you'll need to. In all of our dungeon tests, tanks don't die in 2 or 3 hits unless they are doing something very wrong in the encounter.

Dark Simulacrum<br />
There' still some polish needed on Dark Simulacrum. We are going to try and let it affect everything we possibly can, but there have to be some limitations. Copying pets and the like is just something we can't handle really well. We also need to make sure that some effects have a duration. It's probably okay to copy Shadowform, but Shadowform itself has no duration and the DK version needs to. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702012721/death-knight-discussion/))<br />

Hammer of the Righteous<br />
I think if Hammer of the Righteous went back to its old design of hitting 3 targets, you'd see the forums swarming with paladins in a few weeks demanding some way to AE, such as... removing the cooldown on Consecrate again. There is no way to change the Prot paladin rotation up without changing some core abilities, and we are committed to changing the Prot rotation up.<br />
<br />
We have some room to experiment with the proc rates for Grand Crusader, but remember that the more often it procs, the weaker it has to hit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435176608/protection-paladin/))<br />
<br />
Tanking in Cataclysm<br />
Generally, you should use Inquisition when AE tanking, since it will boost the Holy portion of Hammer of the Righteous as well as Consecrate. You should use Shield of the Righteous when fighting single (or perhaps 2-3) targets, because it's going to hit a lot harder.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, you have a few options. You can glyph Avenger's Shield to focus on one target if you'd like. You can switch to Shield of the Righteous even on group targets when you get Sacred Duty procs. You can use Grand Crusader procs to focus on the targets you are already in melee with, or use Avenger's Shield on additional targets to help hold threat. Consecrate isn't the &quot;threat glue&quot; is used to be, nor does it have 100% up time, so you're going to have some choices about when and where you use it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435176608/protection-paladin/))<br />
<br />
Words of Glory<br />
The main strength of Word of Glory is its cost. No matter how strained mana might get, you're always going to have ample usage of an instant, free heal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560850176/my-holy-paladin-feedback/))<br />
<br />
Healing Mods Talents<br />
It's difficult to offer talents that mod the other heals. If you have a talent that makes Flash of Light more cost effective or Divine Light faster, then those aren't really filling those niches anymore. We had a lot of problems like this in the past where a combination of talents, glyphs or set bonuses made Flash of Light or Holy Light the obvious heal for paladins, and the other one just died. We want to use all 3 of the cast-time healing spells in Cataclysm, but we're offering the most gameplay around Holy Shock and Word of Glory, because those are what make Holy paladins feel the most different from other healers. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560850176/my-holy-paladin-feedback/))<br />
<br />
Beacon of Light<br />
As others have pointed out, Beacon just can't stay as &quot;I heal at 200% effectiveness&quot; in the Cataclysm healing model. It will still give you extra healing, particularly with the Tower of Radiance component. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560850176/my-holy-paladin-feedback/))<br />
<br />
AE Healing<br />
We're not worried about the AE healing situation. In Lich King there were situations, especially in raids, where healers were called upon to instantly heal multiple targets at once or someone was going to die. With the larger health pools in Cataclysm, those situations are just going to be very rare. AE damage, and sometimes raid-wide AE auras, will still exist, but your tools are more than adequate to handle them. No, Light of Dawn may not take 5+ targets from 50% damage to 0% damage, but it also doesn't need to. You'll have time to top them off with single target heals, or just wait until the next AE heal is available. We just don't think spammable AE heals are that fun. If we wanted them to be a big part of the game, we'd need to make actual AE healing rotations that did more. The LK scenarios of hitting Wild Growth and Circle of Healing on cooldown are not something we want to go back to (plus, we've increased those cooldowns). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560850176/my-holy-paladin-feedback/))<br />
<br />
Healing and Mana management<br />
Right. Another way to think of it is Heal, Holy Light and Healing Wave are essentially your heal autoattacks. They won't do anything too impressive, but you can essentially do them forever. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725672943/lvl85-h-paladin-numbers-abilities-thread/))<br />
<br />
Holy Mastery Shield<br />
The paladin mastery should definitely replace a lower shield with a larger one. We're a bit hesitant to just let you continually stack the shield up to its max size. That feels more annoying if anything because then paladins would feel compelled to spam heals on a tank before the pull so they could start with a max strength shield and then drink to restore the mana investment. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725672943/lvl85-h-paladin-numbers-abilities-thread/))<br />
<br />
Guardian of Ancient Kings<br />
The Guardian of Ancient Kings shouldn't take damage or die. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725672943/lvl85-h-paladin-numbers-abilities-thread/))<br />
<br />
Exorcism<br />
As far as where things are supposed to be, we don't want Exorcism to be the largest source of your damage. There were a couple of bugs with the spell implementation (double dipping on AP for instance) and we also recently decided to change Ret's mastery to no longer affect Holy damage, since it was just propping up Exorcism too much. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725723300/feedback-paladin/))<br />
<br />
Templar's Verdict/Divine Storm without 3 Holy Power<br />
We think situationally you will want to use TV or Divine Storm with less than 3 stacks. However, if it's very efficient to do so, then players will never wait for 3 stacks because having 3 smaller hits is more valuable than having 1 large hit of the same total damage.

Enhancement<br />
In my experience, every time I read one of these &quot;lack of focus&quot; or &quot;we don't have a role&quot; threads, it's nearly always because the players are looking for something very different in the class than what it offers and are trying to steer things in a different direction. As such, we generally don't get much useful feedback out of these &quot;existential crisis&quot; kinds of discussions.<br />
<br />
Think really hard about what it is you're asking for. Are you trying to turn Enhancement into a Fury warrior? Are you trying to make a true hybrid that fills many roles at once? Do you just want to be the superhero that always saves your party? Or are you just busting with spell ideas that you'd like to see get implemented? Try and stick with the details and not the big picture from 10,000 feet high. What is the problem you're trying to solve? The intent of the spec design isn't something you need to solve. Figuring out the rough edge that don't feel right is where you can be more helpful.<br />
<br />
Enhancement is a spec designed around combining melee weapons strikes with spells. They also have totems and weapon enchants. Almost all of the talents in the tree support that direction. If half of your talents were trying to turn you into a healer and half of them were trying to turn you into a tank or something, then I'd understand the &quot;no consistent direction&quot; feedback. But that's not what the tree does at all. Stormstrike boosts weapon and spell damage. That is the tree in a nutshell. Other talents boost melee damage or spell damage or both. There are a few survival-oriented talents that should have even more use in PvE in the Cataclysm environment, but are still optional.<br />
<br />
Feedback on which abilities you like or dislike or talents you find useful or not useful is totally appropriate and appreciated. The whole &quot;we're adrift at sea without a direction&quot; nearly always comes across as QQ at best or &quot;here is my pet list of talents&quot; at worst (whether it was intended to or not) so my advice is just to avoid it.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to shoot down the feedback. I'm trying to steer it into a format that is more likely to produce the kind of results that I sense you're really looking for. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560850244/enhancement-lacks-theme-direction/))<br />

Icon Highlights<br />
The icon highlights for things like Overpower and Revenge need a little more polish so that they don't stay lit all the time or light up during a cooldown. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726032498/warriors-12857/))<br />

Colossus Smash<br />
Colossus Smash is indeed still bugged and will make targets harder to kill. It required new tech to get this effect working at all, and it's going to take some time before it is working correctly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26725952958/warriors-wth/))<br />
<br />
Heroic Leap<br />
The Thunder Clap portion of Heroic Leap was the subject of much derision on this very forum. If you liked it, you should have stuck up for it then. It's gone now.<br />
<br />
That sounds harsh, which isn't my intention, but it is really, really common on these forums to see a concerted effort among some players to say &quot;Change X&quot; and then when we do, other players come out of the woodwork to say &quot;But we liked X!&quot; I can't suggest a great solution to that except to pay attention to the kinds of discussions that are happening, and chime in if you disagree with something strongly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560867318/new-warrior-discussion-build-12857/))<br />
<br />
Damage Tuning<br />
We aren't focused on numbers tuning yet, so comments like &quot;RB doesn't hit very hard&quot; or &quot;SMF doesn't compete with TG&quot; just aren't going to be terribly useful posts at this stage. If your measurement of &quot;fun&quot; is &quot;hits for big numbers&quot; then you aren't going to be able to provide beta feedback that helps the developers much.

Tooltips not showing &quot;true&quot; damage<br />
We'll make sure the tooltips reflect the actual damage being done. It's hard to know without looking at each spell individually whether the damage is wrong or the description. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726063044/protection-warrior-damage-issues/))</div></div><hr />

The Thunder Clap portion of Heroic Leap was the subject of much derision on this very forum. If you liked it, you should have stuck up for it then. It's gone now.<br />
<br />
That sounds harsh, which isn't my intention, but it is really, really common on these forums to see a concerted effort among some players to say &quot;Change X&quot; and then when we do, other players come out of the woodwork to say &quot;But we liked X!&quot; I can't suggest a great solution to that except to pay attention to the kinds of discussions that are happening, and chime in if you disagree with something strongly.<br />
<br />
What a load of shit. I don't read those forums, and I can't post in them either! How am I supposed to know in the first place there's a bunch of whine going on? GG Blizzard, there is literally not ONE fucking new ability for Protection now. What are we left with? A crappy version of charge. FUUUUUUUUUUUU</div></div><hr />

I am still wondering how they want to avoid the problem of &quot;overbudgeting&quot; the items again in order to not implement debuffs like Sunwell Radiance and Chill of the Throne.<br />
I am pretty sure I read something already that bosses in following raid tiers would need higher combat ratings for players to hit them etc.<br />
Yet looking at the screenshot a few days ago, where the theorycrafting was incorporated into the character screen you could see that bosses were listed next to the required hit for a mob which is player level +3. Now I know that this has always been.<br />
What I am wondering about is when looking at the character screen and seeing bosses would need 8% to hit and my current gear would fulfill that and still seeing misses at bosses which are in Cata raid tier 2.<br />
<br />
They could list each cata raid tier with the appropriate requirements in the character panel instead, would be less confusing to people (granted of course the system would be implemented I mentioned earlier)<br />
<br />
And don't forget I was talking about that adapting boss system in conjunction with the information provided in the character panel (Blizz obviously wants players to know about those details beforehand instead of searching the web)<br />
<br />
Of course this is all speculation as beta is ongoing :P</div></div><hr />

The point he was trying to make is that you can't just go around life-gripping anyone in particular. They have to be gullible enough to take your party/raid invite first :P<br />
<br />
As for prot warriors not getting any new abilities - that's ok because Prot is already pretty awesome now. We are getting the new baseline abilities, and a few new mechanics such as Blood and Thunder. But sometimes, it's just really hard to improve on awesome :)<br />

Worst 85 class spell ;(The way I read it is going to be limited to your group (as in 5man group or whole raid if you are in one). You actually thought they would let you Life Grip people around you?

Dark Simulacrum<br />
There' still some polish needed on Dark Simulacrum. We are going to try and let it affect everything we possibly can, but there have to be some limitations. Copying pets and the like is just something we can't handle really well. We also need to make sure that some effects have a duration. It's probably okay to copy Shadowform, but Shadowform itself has no duration and the DK version needs to.<br />
<br />
I understand an ability that copies active spells as its own unique brand of Reflecting a spell. A warrior reflects the spell with their shield. A Disc priest used to reflect a portion of spell damage with their power word shield. So copying a spell to reflect it I understand.<br />
<br />
Being able to use it to copy an ability that's always on a Shadow Priest though? How do they prevent that? You can prevent getting spell reflected if you're smart. The only way a Shadow Priest could prevent you from copying shadowform though is to never, ever use it in the first place. This goes for any spell ability like shadowform that you toggle on for long durations. This seems really questionable if not completely wrong..</div></div><hr />

Ok for the lag point, but as far as I know ( and I could very well be wrong; please correct me if that is the case ), the &quot;new&quot; portails to the new zones only exist in SW/Ogri, so I expect the large population to stay where anyway.<br />
<br />
Personnaly, if the lag doesn't yet too bad ( but it shouldn't really ), I like the idea of one &quot;major&quot; capital per faction, as I find it better to walk around a town full of people than one half full</div></div><hr />

&quot;where do i go for [random quest]?&quot;<br />
<br />
When the quest text explains it clear as day, but everyone is too lazy to read it... why are you beta testing? <br />
<br />
People are using beta to play Cataclysm for free instead of actually beta testing, there are a lot of people who would kill to have the chance at beta testing, and all you can do is whine about how one of your abilities is broken, IT IS A BETA TEST YOU JERK.<br />

<br />
They're never* going to update the trees, bushes, or small patches of grass, they will never make World of Warcraft look like the latest Call of Duty game or a 2010 version of Oblivion, it has to be able to run on a wide range of computers, adding new trees and bushes that effect visibility will give people who are playing with lower settings a different game play experience than those with high settings, so it wont happen. You also have to remember having a mid to high end computer is a lot more rare than you would think, I know more people in WoW that play with 800x600 resolutions and very low settings than those who play with 1920x1080 &amp; ultra settings.<br />

Boub? I know selling out to your new robot overlords means less control over ad content, but if you continue the popups and flash crap I'm sure the bulk of the people who come here are just gonna scramble for the AdBlock. :\<br />

I already use AdBlock. I am sick of getting spammed with adds on every website I go too. &gt;:[</div></div><hr />

I enjoy spending my time in SW (favorite race city so far) the design is so cool and I love when they show SW from above it looks so beautiful. The small details like in Cathedral Square with the growing moss between the ground stones is making a huge difference for me :D! It's weird how the small details can do so much sometimes.<br />

So what actually is the point in Heroic Leap now?<br />
<br />
Except that it's awesome that you can jump with brute force at your enemies I think there's not much of value in this skill anymore. Maybe I'm wrong but the thunderclap addition made it so much cooler and I think it would look really awesome in-game as well. Well well, it's only beta and I think Heroic leap will be finished with the tag &quot;EPIC&quot; in the end (hopefully).</div></div><hr />

Anyone who can tell me what that new board by the tree is?<br />
<br />
Could it possibly be the ingame guild recruitment system that I suggested about 2 years ago? :o</div></div><hr />

Nope, that's the billboard that breadcrumbs you to Hyjal or Vashj'ir.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you, the bit about not having Uldum or Twilight Highlands gear in the game yet is an incredibly good point. Uldum is so damn entertaining though, I almost can't stop compulsively progressing.</div></div><hr />

There' still some polish needed on Dark Simulacrum. We are going to try and let it affect everything we possibly can, but there have to be some limitations. Copying pets and the like is just something we can't handle really well. We also need to make sure that some effects have a duration. It's probably okay to copy Shadowform, but Shadowform itself has no duration and the DK version needs to. <br />

I really, really, really just want a solid post on when race changes will be available (for my gnome priest). I know we won't see one for a while but the main thing I want to know is if it will be 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, or a year.<br />
<br />
If it's 3 weeks, that's something I can wait out. 3 months? Maybe, I'll be spending most of the first 1-2 months leveling my shaman main and gearing her. 6 months? Not worth it, I can roll a second priest and get her to 85 easily in that amount of time. Plus I'd rather race change my existing priest who is as old as vanilla dirt and has so many achivements. <br />
<br />
Obviously, they won't be available at release even with restrictions (aka, no achievements gained from changing your race) BUT, then again, they may. Most people still want to experience the new 1-60 adventure (I know I do) but I want my primary alt to be a gnome priest as soon as she can. <br />
<br />
However, I've got a BE priest I am putting off leveling until the expansion simply for the leveling experience. That's just another take on it. If anyone has any reliable or updated information that would be great.</div></div><hr />

Also, Heroic Leap is pure shit. I'm extremely pissed about that PLUS the fact that the blue mentions &quot;We should have stood up for it.&quot; Fuck you, I can't fucking post on the Beta forums and no one was 85 yet so they couldn't have tested it. Beta testers and non beta testers should have been given equal power in stopping such a stupid move.<br />

<br />
It's because they don't work how they should.<br />
<br />
How they should work: Blizzard listens to player concerns and shapes the game accordingly.<br />
How it works: Blizzard reads player feedback, then Ghostcrawler tells them how and why they are wrong and Blizzard is right.<br />
<br />
It's sad but true.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to burst your bubble but this is not a typical spell reflect. DKs cast it on someone, and that person uses their next spell (which still goes off as per normal and is not mitigated) which is 'absorbed.' The DS button is then REPLACED by that spell, available to be used at the DK's discretion. So DKs that are paying attention will see what it is they've stolen and wont use something useless. (That being said, fail DKs may not notice what it is they've stolen...) Regardless, this is still a relatively effective tactic at wasting said DK's new 2m CD.</div></div><hr />

Oh, thanks for the heads up on it. I wasn't sure how it worked. NO beta or skipped it :(. Hopefully not all of classes more fun/useless spells will be removed so they can counter it :)</div></div><hr />
