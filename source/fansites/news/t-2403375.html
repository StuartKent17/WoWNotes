<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chaud</div><div class="date">2018-06-11, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are having trouble with your entry showing up, feel free to send me a PM (https://www.mmo-champion.com/private.php?do=newpm&amp;u=523085) with your battletag and the character, realm, and region you have the achievement on.<br />
<br />
If you have trouble getting your entry to show up as complete, be sure you have logged out of the game if you just earned the achievement. <br />
<br />
Steps to complete before PMing me, as the Battle.Net API is being unreliable:<br />
<br />
Press the refresh button<br />
Wait 5 minutes<br />
Refresh the page<br />
Repeat a couple times</div></div><hr />

Try the refresh button. We are getting lots of timeouts from the Battle.Net API right now. All of the PMs I've received so far I've fixed by pressing the refresh button for the user on my end, or the entry is there by the time I've checked and someone just wasn't patient. <br />
<br />
Hundreds of people have already successfully entered, so the system is working fine, it is just he Battle.Net API erroring. We'll keep auto updating for anyone that logs in every day until the end of the contest to try and enter you so that you don't have to keep trying to refresh.</div></div><hr />

If you have an achievement - just don't give up and try a couple of times. It should let you in.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alyzabeth</div><div class="date">2018-06-11, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an API error with my account somehow. Can't login to the forums either, with the exception of the Overwatch forums. So unable to enter the contest. Just sent in a support ticked. Hopefully they get it resolved in the next few days.</div></div><hr />
