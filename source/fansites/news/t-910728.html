I guess the nerf to raids should make it that more easy to clear for new people and make way for Firelands as BoT /BWD will be out of date by the time the patch hits</div></div><hr />

Less skilled players will now be able to complete them and see the content at a difficulty thats right for them whereas the newer raids will be for more skilled at the intended difficulty level. Means casuals or however people wanna call it will always be a step behind tier wise to a certain extent.<br />
<br />
I think it's a interesting compromise.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">creepygnome</div><div class="date">2011-05-24, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not surprised by the nerfing to cata raids. They always do it right before the release of the next tier so that people can finish it. Otherwise people might stay to finish it instead of moving on to the next tier. <br />
<br />
I am a little surprised that they took away the mage changes. I wonder what happened on the ptr to decide that. Also, they keep tweaking the set bonuses. I don't know if they have ever changed them this many times before a patch release. But, eh, could just be I don't remember.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why the nerfs to T11 when T12 is coming out? Is this because of the legendary quest line requirement?<br />
<br />
That could be a VERY possible answer. Since I believe this is the first time they have had a requirement like that.</div></div><hr />

But seriously, Blizzard is still being lazy. Instead of taking these nerfed versions of the raid boss encounters and making a separate version of the raid with an easy difficulty setting, they have to nerf the whole thing and piss off the other portion of their player base.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i suppose not. they nerfed it so that everyone who has not completed heroic content has a chance to experience ( well, poor choice of words maybe, cause basically every boss is like a training dummy now, i guess ) whatever bosses they have not killed yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are nerfing T11 content for the people who had trouble getting anywhere on either normal or heroic. As hard to understand as it is, there really are guilds who have trouble with the current content. <br />
<br />
For the people that did clear the current content, well, this should not even be bothering them since the all new T12 content will occupy them then.<br />
So think twice before going bananas over these changes.<br />

They always nerf the old content when the new content comes out. Duh. That gets double usage out of the content. Those with determination and drive blow through the new content while those who fall behind experience a lite version of the old content. You COULD wait the 8-9 months to play the lite/nerfed version IF YOU CHOOSE, but you didn't. You played it when it was new, challenging, and fresh. It is no longer fresh or new, naturally the challenge departs for you as well. It's content you're sick of. And even if you aren't sick of the content, this will make it easier for you to clear it being that most of the driven people will be in the new content. It's win-win. You can't POSSIBLY find a way to complain about it unless you are just dead set on complaining about something.</div></div><hr />

I'm surprised no one has made comment on the Tanking changes; before Cata they were going to have Druids still keep using &quot;tank&quot; items; but with the change to STR and now on the flip side, Plate tanks getting little benefit from Agility; you can tell they are really separating the two from each other.

<br />
Two reasons for that:<br />
<br />
1. Any casual scrub will be able to get ilvl 365 gear in patch 4.2. It makes no sense that gear 359 is harder to obtain than gear 365. The heroic modes of those raids remain unchanged.<br />
<br />
2. Only 'Defenders of a Shattered World' can do Firelands. If you have not beaten the previous tier, you can't do the new tier. It's logical they make those raids easier so guilds that are still struggling to become 12/12 can experience the new content.</div></div><hr />

why should a cataclysm-casual even TRY to be a better player when he can just sit back and wait for the nerf and still get his welfare epics?<br />
this is just dumb and once you finally managed to not play 12h a day, you will realize that i'm right<br />
I love how all can just steam roll the raids that were hard for you. like like like it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't want to see less skilled players and/or players with less time available get the chance to clear these instances then I ask why do you care, you'll be a whole tier ahead of the &quot;bads/scrubs/casuals&quot; (call them what you will) and if they want to progress in current content (i.e. Firelands) then they will still have to step their game up. So they will get welfare 359s because of the changes, so what, 359s will be available for justice points and yet better gear will come from new dailies, crafted and vp from running older heroics without ever setting foot in any raid (plus the BH loot pinata will be up for free tier 12).<br />
<br />
I'm all for hard content and not giving things away easily, according to wowprogress there are just over 500 guilds that are 13/13, how many of the people complaining are in one of those guilds? If you aren't then I refer you back to my first point, this change is making it easier for everyone who isn't in those 500 guilds and hasn't in approaching 7 months cleared the available content.</div></div><hr />

It's logical they make those raids easier so guilds that are still struggling to become 12/12 can experience the new content. <br />

Only 'Defenders of a Shattered World' can do Firelands? I think you read that wrong. Only 'Defenders of a Shattered World' can do the Legendary quest.</div></div><hr />

They always nerf the old content when the new content comes out. Duh. That gets double usage out of the content. Those with determination and drive blow through the new content while those who fall behind experience a lite version of the old content. You COULD wait the 8-9 months to play the lite/nerfed version IF YOU CHOOSE, but you didn't. You played it when it was new, challenging, and fresh. It is no longer fresh or new, naturally the challenge departs for you as well. It's content you're sick of. And even if you aren't sick of the content, this will make it easier for you to clear it being that most of the driven people will be in the new content. It's win-win. You can't POSSIBLY find a way to complain about it unless you are just dead set on complaining about something.<br />

<br />
And yes, my guild is 6/13 HC25 atm, since we are a 25man guild, we constantly have to recruit new players to replace those who fail and drag us down. We have been building this guild since Cata launched, and it's not yet come to the point where we aren't carrying anyone, so we might want to continue progressing on the t11 end bosses in 4.2 if they aren't down by then.

With the addition of a new tier of armor and weapons, we want to make the previous tier more accessible in ways other than just a shift of currency type, so we are making item level 359 gear purchasable for Justice points in the upcoming content patch. <br />

<br />
Feeling cheated about what? If you're not having fun don't play. These nerfs are to allow people to get to T12 content with T11 gear easier. If you're so butthurt about your investment you really need to sit down and have an honest discussion with yourself about what is fun for you, as it is not the same for anyone else. T11 content being easier allows more people to get the gear for T12 content and I welcome that. I enjoy people getting to see bosses that would have taken weeks or even months longer to reach. Also, coming later into the game without &quot;Freebie&quot; heroic gear and easier earlier tiers makes the entry level for getting into the higher content harder, they're just lowering the bar so more can enjoy.</div></div><hr />

As long as few first bosses in Firelands are balanced for 350 gear - then ppl can go back and finish of the older content.<br />
<br />
But it seems BLizzard is tuning the normals for over 365 gear atm.<br />
<br />
Why would you balance new raids for an item level lower than what drops in the previous tier? You would just steam roll it lmao<br />
Especially those in 372-379 heroic gear from the current tier, if you cant get over 365 item level for firelands go back an do some heroic tier 11, in other words there killing off normals but you can still get good gear an a challenge from tier 11 heroics to help with firelands</div></div><hr />

Not a bad thing though. People have the Achieves to show &quot;I did it before the massive nerf&quot;, it helps people gear up for Firelands, and lets people clear the fights they've been struggling on a bit so they can at least see the rest of the bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From TB's Facebook:<br />
&quot;Today's Azeroth Daily will be the last of the season. The show will be taking a hiatus until such time as the game is fit to cover again. This is due to the announcement that all normal-mode bosses will be nerfed to the ground in 4.2. I have no more enthusiasm for the game, nor do I agree with the direction it's going and as such have decided to do what any responsible consumer would do and unsubscribe.&quot;</div></div><hr />

With just 2 people in the middle are never satisfied with either difficulty.<br />
<br />
They should do it for all dungeons, it isn't hard to just copy paste the dungeon, change a the numbers and call it another difficulty, look at it here, they are constantly having to nerf and buff dungeons in the meantime anyways, those same changes are as simple as retuning another version of the same dungeon.<br />
<br />
All consider the people that aren't very good, but try hard and are completing the latter part of current raiding are going to feel like their kills after 4.2 are meaningless, pretty much screwed, not only that but what if somebody had less time, had more time late 4.1 or in 4.2 to start raiding can't have the same experience.<br />
<br />
Besides with dungeon journal coming out, which is a very good thing at that, could lead to a big improvement of PuG raids, as well as guild ones.</div></div><hr />

This change only affects reg mode for the love of the Titans. If you're truly a hardcore player, you probably haven't been doing reg modes since January to begin with. Unless you're another of those wannabe hardcores who plague these forums...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2011-05-24, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i suppose not. they nerfed it so that everyone who has not completed heroic content has a chance to experience ( well, poor choice of words maybe, cause basically every boss is like a training dummy now, i guess ) whatever bosses they have not killed yet.<br />
<br />
Except that heroic modes aren't for that. That's why they've created normal and heroics.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'll just be happy for those who don't want to spend a lot of time / effort on this when the content is current, but still would like to experience the whole game. Good for them, besides it only seems to apply to normal mode. At least there aren't any nerfs to heroic mechanics. Those looking to do the drake meta achievements / heroic versions will still have quite a challenge, as there's still plenty of instant wipe mechanics which won't be overgeared anytime soon.<br />

<br />
So why does it matter that old content is nerfed so others can experience it? Heroic modes are still unchanged and the new T12 is going to be even more challenging. So what if we can raise alts easier or be able to allow more of the 'casuals' a chance to see the great work done in the game. If I spent months on making a raid like they have you sure bet I would want as many people to see it as possible and this seems a preaty fair way to do it now that its old content. The raid will get ran now where as say in WOTLK no one touched older raids except for achievement runs, if even that, and the content just rotted. Now its still alive and I say good move.</div></div><hr />

He as many others have said &quot;just make a freaking another difficulty level&quot;, some people are in progress of this content now and having it changed up in the middle of their progression is a stick to the eye, it may not screw over 90% of the WoW pop, but even if it is only 5%, which it is likely higher (because these guys aren't hardcore+skilled players) it screws them over VERY, VERY, VERY hard.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ganush</div><div class="date">2011-05-24, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol at all the qq'ing. If I were in charge, I'd do the exact same thing. What the hell is wrong with making content accessible to more once it is no longer current progression. It doesn't affect progression raiders other than alts perhaps, but the gamer behind the alt still has challenging content to play and it allows more people to enjoy more aspects of the game without drama and frustration. As far as I can tell they aren't nerfing heroic content so anything that will provide (semi) current itemized gear will still be difficult.<br />
<br />
I think this is a great way to progress raids tbh. There has been plenty of time to clear tier 11 normal for anyone truly interested in it. Going into Firelands, guilds that have only done normal versions or just dabbled in heroics will have two choices for upgrades, tier 12 normal or tier 11 heroic. Guilds who are in full 372's can jump right into tier 12 heroics if they desire or get a small gear upgrade by running tier 12 normals for a while. Guilds or players who haven't cleared tier 11 normal by now can now see that content and gear up towards the next tier more easily. The only people it will affect at all is those with alts, but the reality is Blizzard should cater to more customers and this is a way to do it. The hardcores have new difficult content, the less skilled can now go ahead and see the full first tier in a way that fits their gameplay. Win Win.</div></div><hr />

Casuals =/= Bads, learn the difference.<br />
If someone is a casual, he had enough time to get 12/12 without a problem, even raiding for 1-2 days a week.<br />
On the other hand, if someone is bad, he'll wipe on Magmaw trash for a month. Nerfing content will only have one effect- bads will not learn anything and by brute force they will get epix. No skill raising at all. No learning. No progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are nerfing T11 content for the people who had trouble getting anywhere on either normal or heroic. As hard to understand as it is, there really are guilds who have trouble with the current content. <br />
<br />
For the people that did clear the current content, well, this should not even be bothering them since the all new T12 content will occupy them then.<br />
So think twice before going bananas over these changes.<br />

Apply real logic: Patch 4.2 = Way better and easy to obtain gear from valor and new faction. T12 &gt; T11 Heroic. Tough choice between T12 and T11 piece for a slot? LOL.<br />
<br />
Need to nerf if you're alread nerfing it by providing superior gear? Omg... some nerfs are directly to the mechanic of the fight, killing it totally. How it is &quot;experience the encounter that we designed with so much love for you&quot;???<br />
<br />
The only reason for everything they did since removing gating in TBC was to allow &quot;players&quot; to see the encounters and all that they've created. So now a &quot;burn everything down&quot; is the encounter they're so pride of showing to the rest of player base? Crazy stuff.</div></div><hr />

I can say i was worried about my alt priest to not get legendary staff quest but thx i can now beat all bosses when 4.2 release and get the legendary for my priest too.<br />
<br />
The only kind of hard boss is in t11 normal is Neferian. And even if you have a pug who knows what they are doing its even piece of cake to now this is like <br />
<br />
4.2 Patch notes : All T11 Raid are now available for LFG Que you just que up and get 2 parties of 5 man dungeon and go clear the raid content with out any trouble. + Free Epicssss...<br />

Also I wonder if they make head and shoulder tier ( that require Tokens) Available for Justice points ???<br />

I just don't understand why people care? How does this hurt anyone especially if you are clearing heroics or even better 13/13? The only thing I can think of is that people are having a tough time with real life and this is the one area they feel they are superior?</div></div><hr />

i really dont understand what all this complaining is about its old content if you are truly a ''hardcore raider'' or what ever then you will be in the firelands this nerf is for all thoose casual raiders who couldnt experience this content no need to qq about old content let get on with the new content already.</div></div><hr />

Especially those in 372-379 heroic gear from the current tier, if you cant get over 365 item level for firelands go back an do some heroic tier 11, in other words there killing off normals but you can still get good gear an a challenge from tier 11 heroics to help with firelands<br />
<br />
Normal is progression from normal gear<br />
<br />
Heroic is progression from heroic gear. <br />
<br />
Thats how it should be . You should not be forced to do heroic to be able to do normals. Thats just stupid.</div></div><hr />

If someone is a casual, he had enough time to get 12/12 without a problem, even raiding for 1-2 days a week.<br />
On the other hand, if someone is bad, he'll wipe on Magmaw trash for a month. Nerfing content will only have one effect- bads will not learn anything and by brute force they will get epix. No skill raising at all. No learning. No progress.<br />
<br />
Wich will lead to nerfs on the next current tier since there won't be anything else to do other than Firelands. Unless they surprise us and bring a few more heroics out of nowhere with Firelands, those ppl will want to down everything in firelands the same way.</div></div><hr />

It was said &quot;content will gradually nerfs itself with better gear and polished strategies&quot;. I think someone at the dev table didn't agree with this sentence and just wanted everyone to faceroll stomp t11 to show his achievements and be proud...<br />

<br />
But omg... that's... no words... I guess that wearing 36x+ gear isn't enough then...<br />
<br />
Heroic modes are to challenge hardcore+ skilled+ coordinated groups.<br />
Normal modes are to be there for dedicated players, hardmodes were designed, unfortunately with these top 10 guilds an such in mind to be challenging at an absurd level, gear may make it more challenging but its a numbers game, reaction or skill is less of a challenge in hardmode.<br />
<br />
Hardmode becomes much more number crunching, raw power requiring, min-maxing, doing all this with the reaction and skilled thinking part included are added into this. Hardmode is a pretty big jump from regular mode, but you know a good number of players would like to be challenged.<br />
<br />
So people rolling alts even, hardmode would be way to hard for the avg player to ever want to beat their heads on the wall with, so the content will just be skipped on that level, and people will just run easier mode 5 mans for gear now.</div></div><hr />

Guess I should of mentioned I'm one of those who hasn't killed all the bosses in reg mode yet. There is a certain team of 10 in the guild that has but since there are only about 22 of us that run regularly but there are only 3 geared guild healers, I'm working on one myself but we are trying to keep from alts getting raiding gear because there are mains who haven't been able to do it yet. Currently there isn't the option to make 2 10 man teams due to lack of roles. Since one team is so well geared they keep running everything till they master it 100% then slowly they open room for others which is usualy when one of them is off for the day. Once it becomes an easier mode it will be much less stress on those that will be able to roll the other roles (ie: healing) with weaker gear so the mains can still get their stuff and experience. The two new heroics helped with that some but running two raids with one very well geared group then another group who is like back at day one takes a heavy toll on you.</div></div><hr />

They should make it avaiable for justice points. I doubted they would do it since it looked like they wanted to keep T11 worthwhile for said tokens for 4pc bonuses, but now... no reason for not to.<br />

Guess they really had a few new heroics for 4.2... &quot;the all time player favorite Bastion of Twilight, BWD and TotFW are now level 85 heroics&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I would agree with you except for the fact that Blizzard is only releasing 1 raid with 7 bosses this tier, and contrary to popular belief raiders enjoy raiding. I know some guilds will still be farming heroic BoT for the Sinestra trinket and working on achievements for the mount, but these nerfs along with the general lack of raid content will lead T11 to head the path of Naxx with many people quitting due to general lack of effort needed. When a good player doesn't have to actually think to beat any encounter it generally leads to player burnout.</div></div><hr />

You dont need 372 gear for firelands -_- .... If that was the point.. so for Heroics BOT/BWD/Thrones... you need to have ilvl370?... 359 was enough for it, for firelands 359 will be the starting gear, probably w/ an average of 365 will make normal encounters &quot;Easier&quot; and w/ Fireland gear (37*) will make Heroics w/ modarate dificulty</div></div><hr />

<br />
so, this is a slight boost to DKs, but a massive boost to Paladins and Warriors who only ever had normal parry chance. The original Forceful Deflection was to compensate for lack of block, so either they are trying to bait Ps and Ws to gear for Parry as a way to discourage them from getting Mastery Capped, or they forgot that the difference was due to DKs lack of shields.<br />

359 gear will be awailable from Justice points so there is no need for anyone to go back really. The normal content should be balanced for 359 gear in the first place... so that resonable progression can be achived by most players in normals. Heroics can then be done instead of normals for more challenge.</div></div><hr />
