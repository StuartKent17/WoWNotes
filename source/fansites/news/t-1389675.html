<br />
What instantly came to mind: How cool would it be if you were able to raid/seige another players garrison when they were online to take resources? Man the ideas are flooding in now. That would be so much fun. Big incentive on building your garrison strategically, more risk to sending out followers on missions or whatever it is they do as you would have less NPC defenders to aid in repelling invaders. Make it so Blizzard!</div></div><hr />

blizzard do this often, it just means they have another character to use for future expansions. see like the Neptulon questline in cata, building up to something, then totally abandoned in MoP.</div></div><hr />

They havn't gutted random matchmaking at all - I have no clue what you are talking about, You can still queue for Dungeons and LFR like you would in MoP, and now have the option to pug Flex/Normal modes.. If anything random matchmaking has increased</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about?<br />
<br />
Secondary stats will still be variable between gear. It's just primary stats that will change based on spec.<br />
<br />
All this means is that hybrids can tank, heal, or dps with a single drop, the way pures can dps with a single drop. You'll still have to prioritize haste, crit, or mastery as needed to maximize the potential of your spec.</div></div><hr />

7 new max level dungeons, the leveling dungeons will also have max level version, they'll all have heroic versions, and they just confirmed that they intend to add more new heroic dungeons in future tiers, with the caveat that they may scale the difficulty of older heroics up so that they don't have to segment them into seperate categories.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;That's not a good use of time right now.&quot; - Meaning we'll save that for another expansion as a selling point.<br />
<br />
New character models being done and them making new customization for characters. Another thing they will push off for an expansion or two. I'll be highly surprised if they even get all of the character models out before the last patch of this expansion. They might even split each race into 5 different patches and do one limb at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's what makes a piece of crappy gear usable. a warrior can reforge some useless haste to crit. ideal stats. otherwise, you just have to live with what you get.<br />
<br />
also removes some depth from gearing a character. not that reforging is hard, but the option is nice.</div></div><hr />

It's still too early to tell what's to come though (although if they said it they will probably remove reforge), but you have to think about the changes as a whole, not just that they remove reforge, but what else they change about the game mechanics and class mechanics and how will those interact with each other.</div></div><hr />

They're saving that for 5 expansions from now. The next 3 will really just be this one split up into 3 more parts on Draenor. Then they'll revisit Northrend with somekind of time travel device and it will focus on the birth of Thrall's child which will reempower the dragon aspects and then bake cakes for everyone with Thrally-Sue inside Ulduar. Which will then be a fortified orc stronghold with Garrosh as the final boss of the expansion. (But Thrall's infant will temporarily subdue him.) <br />
<br />
After that we'll have the Burning Legion expansion. We'll reconquer the Blasted Lands from a new Orc clan called the Bronze Offensive, and they will have enslaved some Doomguards and Infernals. Then Garrosh will show up and be the final boss, again.</div></div><hr />

What I think is going to happen is that we fail to stop the Iron horde from entering Azeroth and Gul'dan who is in a skype call with Kil'jaeden will tell him the location of Azeroth at the end of the expansion and BAM! That's the next expansion for you!<br />

Someone obviously has never worked in software development. If you think you can just 'plug in' old source code from years ago and expect it to be compatible with no issues, you've got another thing coming. They might even have removed the ability because it was making other code considerably more complex.<br />
<br />
It would probably be easier just to code the stuff from scratch again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
To provide a truly epic world PvP experience, the number of players and the amount of faction members allowed in the zone wonât be capped.<br />
<br />
Not the former but the latter announcement is good overall. However:<br />
<br />
Unless countermeasures are taken, even the realm groups formed cross-realm will become more and more imbalanced over time in horde/alliance ratio, like their individual PvP realms did.<br />
<br />
There is one way to solve that *permanently*. First, understand the problem:<br />
<br />
WoW PvP realms have what physical real-world engineering calls an uncontrolled positive feedback loop.<br />
<br />
Once one faction starts getting outnumbered, there is unfortunately still more incentive to switch to the overpopulated faction side (more playable than dying realm sides), escalating the imbalance further. An imbalance of 1.2:1 to often becomes 2:1, then 3:1, then 4:1, and so on. Thus WoW has many PvP realms with such as a 10+:1 ratio of horde to alliance, or other extreme imbalances which developed over time.<br />
<br />
But uncontrolled feedback loops are solved all the time in mechanical and electrical engineering. Such can be *permanently* fixed by adding negative feedback stabilization.<br />
<br />
For example, http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/FEEDBACK.html :<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The wild behavior of positive loops - a veritable death wish - must be controlled by negative loops. This control is essential for a system to maintain itself in the course of time. [...]<br />
<br />
[With negative feedback stabilization] there is tight control; the system oscillates [closely] around an ideal equilibrium that it never attains. A thermostat or a water tank equipped with a float are simple examples of regulation by negative feedback.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless Blizzard adds negative feedback stabilization, methods like connected realms will only help partially and temporarily at faction balance, for they don't solve the root problem.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
It can be solved, however.<br />
<br />
Let's first illustrate for a hypothetical new PvP realm, starting at around an even 50/50 faction ratio. How could Blizzard make that faction ratio stay approximately balanced continuously, even throughout many months or years to come? By doing this: Have a server computer monitor the average number of players of each faction actively playing in the past month, on a realm or a set of connected realms. Choosing an appropriate value of X, the faction side there with Y% lower population gets a X*Y% bonus to the gain rate of honor, reputation, experience, gold, and/or items in drops.<br />
<br />
So, for instance, if a 3% overpopulation on one side occurs, the bonus to the other side is small but enough that a few people switch over because of it. Constantly the horde/alliance ratio bounces around 50/50. Sometimes it is 51/50, but then it self corrects back to 50/50, or maybe it overshoots to 50/52, but it never gets to 90/10 or the like, as it is in relatively stable equilibrium. To use an analogy, it becomes like a ball bouncing around in a canyon instead of one about to fall off the tip of a pyramid, like science textbooks illustrate the difference between stable and unstable equilibrium.<br />
<br />
The beauty of that is nobody is absolutely forced to switch to the underpopulated faction side (if they greatly don't want to), but those who do so will be exactly those who mind doing so least.<br />
<br />
Some individuals would switch at a 2% bonus; some wouldn't switch at less than a 20% or higher bonus, but the ones who switch at the 2% bonus are those who fix the ratio for others, so it never gets to needing a 20% or higher bonus. By &quot;switch,&quot; I often mean actually just which faction someone creating a new alt or new character decides to choose, although faction/realm change services could be discounted when moving towards an underpopulated faction side on a realm.<br />
<br />
What about a realm which isn't new, which isn't starting at near even faction ratio? That is a worse situation, but implementation with initially a low value of X, gradually increased, could gently fix faction imbalance on any PvP realm over time. That would be in combination with some more connected realms and some discounted or free realm/faction transfers to appropriate destinations, but the negative feedback incentive system is the most critical part for, once a near-even faction ratio is obtained, making it stay approximately balanced forever.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
This proposal is superior to a commonly proposed suboptimal idea: The closest that most people come to thinking of a lasting faction-imbalance countermeasure is an unnecessarily heavy-handed crude method like stopping all creation of new characters on (and all transfers to) overpopulated faction sides on some realms, but no individual needs to so lose choice entirely. See above.<br />
<br />
My hopes here are almost none, since Blizzard's suggestions forum was deleted and communication to developers has been going towards simple 140-character Twitter remarks and TLDR, which doesn't allow thought at a deep enough level. But Blizzard could save a lot of future trouble.</div></div><hr />

Not if their new character scaling system gets finished. Itll do all the scaling for them, so that even with good gear, they can make the instances relevant/challenging.</div></div><hr />
