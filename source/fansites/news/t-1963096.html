<br />
3/11 PvP Alpha Dev Update<br />
Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
First off, I want to thank you for taking part in this Alpha. Your participation and feedback has proven invaluable over the past week and we already feel things are moving in the right direction. <br />
<br />
We want to share some of our thoughts about PvP and the Alpha process as well as some of the changes we've been making in response to your feedback.<br />
<br />
The Honor System<br />
The new Honor System is Legion's major PvP feature and so it is important to test the full experience during Alpha. We wanted to gauge what it felt like to earn honor through Battlegrounds and Arenas then unlock PvP talents over time. For the most part, we think it feels pretty good, but have definitely heard the feedback that people would like their first 6 talents faster.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds and Skirmishes<br />
When we initially launched Alpha, Skirmish queues were disabled so that we could focus people in Battlegrounds. We knew that concurrency would eventually drop off a bit and Skirmishes would become a better option for people to PvP. Skirmish queues tend to pop very quickly because there are less people required to start them and they are not affected by faction population balance. Looking forward, it's likely that we'll temporarily disable Skirmishes when we expand the number of people in Alpha to once again focus feedback on Battlegrounds. But for now, Skirmishes may be the best way for you to play the game.<br />
<br />
Class Balance<br />
This is a tricky time for PvP class balance in the Alpha. At this time, the Class Designers are primarily focused on implementation and haven't had the opportunity to do a balance pass on many abilities, talents and artifact traits. We've been playing the Alpha right along side you and realize there are a number of classes that feel overtuned. The good news is that this gives us a great opportunity to try many of the new PvP specific tuning knobs we have at our disposal. Going through this process has been super valuable, calling out situations where these systems were falling short. We really appreciate you being patient as we sort them out.<br />
<br />
Damage<br />
Damage in the Alpha certainly feels high. We like fast paced gameplay, but some specializations feel especially bursty. In some cases, this extreme damage is caused by a bug, like we recently encountered with Assassination Rogues and their artifact trait, Surge of Toxins. But it could just be that a spec hasn't been tuned down appropriately yet. In cases like this, we may reduce a spec's overall damage by decreasing the amount of Agility, Intellect or Strength in their PvP stat templates. But It may also be the case that just one or two spells are a problem. If you encounter a spell doing an extreme amount of damage, please let us know and we'll correct it for PvP.<br />
<br />
We've also started adjusting some of the healing spells on non-healer specs. We know this is a big point of concern for the community. We'd like to see the rate of damage slow down a bit but self-healing needs to be reigned in as well in order for that to feel good. We'll be adjusting individual self-healing spells where necessary.<br />
<br />
Tanks<br />
Tanks are certainly overtuned on Alpha right now when it comes to survivability and damage in PvP. We've reduced their damage and their health pools but we've also started to reduce the effectiveness of their mitigation. We'll continue to monitor tank performance and adjust them accordingly. We think making tanks a fun option in PvP has potential, but it means killing a tank in a reasonable amount of time must be possible.<br />
<br />
Healers<br />
Healers do not feel strong enough on Alpha to be fun. In the next build, we'll be increasing the healing capability of many of the healing specs to ensure their throughput can keep up with damage.<br />
<br />
Again, we want to thank you for your patience and commitment when it comes to testing the game. Your feedback has been tremendous and we really appreciate all you've done to help make Legion an amazing expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Tanks in PVP<br />
We're aware of the tank issue and we have some hotfixes in test to reduce their self-healing and mitigation in PvP only. The class team is also looking at them from a dungeon and raiding standpoint as well. We appreciate you guys playing and bringing the issue to the forefront.<br />
<br />
The problem is not the tank class itself its the pvp talent that stops anything under 10% of their max hp from doing any dmg at all its stupid. Lol when I saw that ability I LMAO. That pvp talent has no business in the game in its current state or in any incarnation for that matter. <br />
It is being changed. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/404646-tanks-in-pvp/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742954172?page=1#9))<br />

Legion PvP Queue Times<br />
Hi folks. We activated skirmish queues yesterday morning in response to the long battleground queues. We're in discussion about how to remedy the battleground situation.

[Restoration Druid] Cultivation Behavior<br />
Thanks, both of these should be fixed in the next build--Cultivation will proc from the initial heal of Rejuvenation, and it will not have its own initial heal when applied or refreshed.<br />
<br />
The conditional refreshing (it doesn't refresh if the target has an existing Cultivation longer than 6s) is intended, to allow it to benefit properly from Flourish. It should have no downside now.

<br />
Restoration Druid Feedback -- Build 21249 -- 9-Mar<br />
One quick mechanics clarification from the other thread--you should be seeing Lifebloom give its bloom if you refresh in the final few seconds (same mechanic as Living Bomb). You don't have to choose between maintaining 100% uptime and benefiting from the bloom. You will still lose the bloom if you swap targets, however.

Discipline Priest Feedback -- Build 21249 -- 9-Mar<br />
PW:Solace cooldown should be getting reduced by haste, as of the same build that changed the base cooldown (as with many other effects).<br />
<br />
There are likely still tuning changes needed, mainly due to the strength of Mindbender's added damage with the new Atonement. Note that the difference isn't quite as dramatic as it appears on a raw comparison, since Solace's effective mana value includes the cost of the Smites it replaces, and similarly, 1/3 of Mindbender's damage offsets the Shadowfiend that it replaces. We'll look at the tuning.<br />
<br />
edit: you beat me to it. But yes, Solace should be quite reasonable as it is; that row shouldn't need anything more than the usual tuning that happens during beta.

Restoration Shaman Feedback -- Build 21249 -- 9-Mar<br />
Thanks for all the feedback. We discussed and decided there's little downside to putting on a damage cap, akin to Guardian Spirit, to help alleviate these concerns, so we'll go ahead and do that soon (not 100% sure yet on the precise mechanics or when it will show up on alpha). What I posted above still holds with regard to spotting problems with the spell generally, but we agree the one relating to meteor-type effects is easy enough to anticipate, and the fix doesn't impact the intended use of the spell in any way.<br />
<br />
The other discussion that's been interwoven--how to evaluate the intended use of the talent in the absence of the specific encounter concerns--is an interesting one, and I've seen a variety of very different evaluations both here and elsewhere.

Polygon is reporting (http://www.polygon.com/2016/3/11/11208284/wildstar-developer-carbine-studios-layoffs) that 40 percent of the studio (70 people) were let go, with more layoffs coming in the future. <br />
Earlier this morning, Carbine Studios completed a reorganization of its operating structure. Moving forward, the studio will focus on operating and updating WildStar as a live game in the US and Europe. As part of this change, the studio has canceled its plans to bring WildStar to China.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as a result of these changes, we’ve had to reduce staff. These cuts are directly tied to WildStar’s evolution from a product in development to a live title, to the cancellation of work to bring WildStar to China, and to the overall performance of WildStar since launch in 2014.<br />
<br />
These kinds of decisions are exceptionally difficult. The talented and passionate professionals who are impacted by these cuts have been valuable team members and respected colleagues. We wish everyone well for the future and will be providing severance and employment search assistance.<br />
<br />
As for WildStar, we remain committed to the game. Over the next few weeks and months we will deliver a significant update to the game, kick off a variety of community events, and continue our work on new content that we will talk more about in the near future.<br />
<br />

EverQuest Next Cancelled<br />
There was bad news from another MMO today (https://www.daybreakgames.com/news/daybreak-president-community-letter-everquest-next-2016) as well:<br />
I’m writing today to let you know that, after much review and consideration, Daybreak is discontinuing development of EverQuest Next.<br />
<br />
For the past 20 years EverQuest has been a labor of love. What started as a deep passion of ours, as game creators, grew into a much larger passion shared by you, millions of players and Daybreakers alike. Watching EverQuest’s ability to entertain and bring people together has inspired and humbled us. It’s shaped our culture and has emboldened us to take aggressive risks with our game ideas and products. When we decided to create the next chapter in the EverQuest journey, we didn’t aim low. We set out to make something revolutionary.<br />
<br />
For those familiar with the internals of game development, you know that cancellations are a reality we must face from time to time. Inherent to the creative process are dreaming big, pushing hard and being brutally honest with where you land. In the case of EverQuest Next, we accomplished incredible feats that astonished industry insiders. Unfortunately, as we put together the pieces, we found that it wasn’t fun. We know you have high standards when it comes to Norrath and we do too. In final review, we had to face the fact that EverQuest Next would not meet the expectations we – and all of you – have for the worlds of Norrath.<br />
<br />
The future of the EverQuest franchise as a whole is important to us here at Daybreak. EverQuest in all its forms is near and dear to our hearts. EverQuest and EverQuest II are going strong. Rest assured that our passion to grow the world of EverQuest remains undiminished.</div></div><hr />

ahahaha.<br />
<br />
I think it more has to do with the state of the mmo gender as whole. WoW is feeling the effects of the lack of interest in the mmo market, while others are failing to startup at all. Sadly mmo's are failing due to lack of interest from new players / market and the overall stagnation of the gender as a whole.<br />
Which is why Blizzard is branching out to different games, I don't expect WoW to last another 10 years.</div></div><hr />

TBH I think as of WoD frost is one of the best looking specs in the game. I was hoping they'd update Blizzard to be less like glowing blue things and more thematically consistent with the higher quality effects of Comet Storm. But overall it was the least in need of visual updates. They're welcome, though.<br />

this is the main problem with creating fake hype by releasing alpha materials to public - this shit should be developed behind closed doors untill its polished enough for beta else we have comments like this. i bet you diamonds against nuts that if it was up to dev team we wouldnt get even a close look at those untill all classes would be semi finished and polished then everybody would be like &quot;omg suchamazing new grpahics for all clases etc etc&quot; <br />

<br />
But by beta things are far too set or there isn't enough time to change anything substantial. Player feedback is very, very fucking important. Obviously not from that guy you quoted because he hates everything. But I am not happy with the state of Retribution, most retadins aren't, I promise you now that if they waited til beta to release, even the minor changes they've made so far would not be happening. It happened to Locks in WoD. Loads of complaints at the end of the beta, and nothing changed. Are you actually arguing that the playerbase should ignore anything mechanics wise and just be happy with the new graphics?<br />
<br />
<br />
And no, WoD was bad for the game because it was a bad expansion with barely any content in it that was abandoned half way through, not because of some sodding &quot;casual vs hardcore&quot; debate. I am by no means casual and WoD has been the expansion I log on the least, I certainly don't feel very catered to. Just raiding at all does not make you a hardcore no lifer, grow up and stop adding to the movements of sections of the playerbase constantly fucking blaming each other and trying to take away each others fun, no one group is carrying the game. <br />
<br />
Maybe give Blizzard some feedback on specific content types you would like to see rather than moaning about teh hardcores?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the guys developing the game from ground zero were let go, and the management stays, milking all the remaining dollars they can.<br />
Instead of taking those oh so &quot;talented and passionate professionals&quot; and try for a different game (like at Blizzard, where one team starts working on Heartstone - a huge success - and another on Overwatch - also likely a huge success). Must be a horrible job, work like a dog, and then be let go instead of being given other perspectives in the company. But I guess that's how things go these days.<br />
<br />
In any case, without developers backing it, that game's hollowed out now - just a matter of time before it falls apart.<br />

<br />
i remember usually when a &quot;wow killer&quot; would come out they'd do something to offset the release of the competitor's mmo, now there does not seem to be anything in sight that will motivate them.<br />
<br />
the pvp already sounds to be in dire straits, they say the damage is a bit much, but their solution is to make healers more powerful, which to me indicates their tuning process is already failing. it would be easier imo to tone down the damage instead and make the game more strategic, but they seem intent on the burst vs burst ideas. id imagine by the end of the legion cycle it will be even more ridiculous burst (heal and dps) than it is now.<br />
<br />
hoping legion has more content than WoD, but who am i kidding ill probably play it regardless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other Blizzard games are worth playing - I'd still own D3 if another publisher had made it (in it's current form). Hearthstone and Overwatch aren't my thing, but I can see their appeal. <br />
<br />
Blizzard as a whole is a decent company. That's why I laugh at the &quot;Evil Kotick is destroying WoW!&quot; comments that litter this site - because for all of his evil ways, they're still shipping decent games that people enjoy playing. Anything negative that happens is &quot;ACTIVISION!&quot;, but the positive things...well, they don't have much to say, do they? All the dire predictions of layoffs and such...lol...<br />
<br />
Anyway, specifically, I don't like the direction WoW has taken, and the dev's behind that decision, but it just means I won't be buying their expansions anymore - but I still play Diablo 3 and will buy another expansion for it, if they release one. Choice is great. Blizzard is one of the best game developers in the market - their art department is one of the best, if not THE best, and there's a lot of talent at the company in all the other departments. <br />
<br />
Their only problem is figuring out what they're going to do with the Starcraft and Diablo franchises, as the current games are coming to an end. They're hiring for a Diablo related product, which is great, and I expect we'll see something Starcraft related in the future months. Hearthstone can keep churning out expansion packs forever. Overwatch has a huge life ahead of it. WoW...we'll see. Job security is pretty high at Blizzard these days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the past 20 years EverQuest has been a labor of love. What started as a deep passion of ours, as game creators, grew into a much larger passion shared by you, millions of players and Daybreakers alike. Watching EverQuest’s ability to entertain and bring people together has inspired and humbled us. It’s shaped our culture and has emboldened us to take aggressive risks with our game ideas and products. When we decided to create the next chapter in the EverQuest journey, we didn’t aim low. We set out to make something revolutionary.<br />
<br />
For those familiar with the internals of game development, you know that cancellations are a reality we must face from time to time. Inherent to the creative process are dreaming big, pushing hard and being brutally honest with where you land. In the case of EverQuest Next, we accomplished incredible feats that astonished industry insiders. Unfortunately, as we put together the pieces, we found that it wasn’t fun. We know you have high standards when it comes to Norrath and we do too. In final review, we had to face the fact that EverQuest Next would not meet the expectations we – and all of you – have for the worlds of Norrath.<br />
<br />
The future of the EverQuest franchise as a whole is important to us here at Daybreak. EverQuest in all its forms is near and dear to our hearts. EverQuest and EverQuest II are going strong. Rest assured that our passion to grow the world of EverQuest remains undiminished.<br />
<br />
I am sad and angered to hear this news as I feel sucker'ed because I bought into the beta...100 dollars down the drain.</div></div><hr />

Are there going to be a great number of people that will have a whole empty room just to walk around and be in another &quot;world&quot;?<br />
<br />
I know I've got one if I move a coffee table and a chair out of the way, so do most of my friends.<br />
<br />
And what's the alternative? An Internet Cafe-type setup? In which point again, people won't care what they look like, because the people going there are there for the same experience. They aren't going to be setting it up in their front yard or anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm thinking in the vein of Diablo 3. I don't mind beautiful graphics but if things are so intense, I can't see if that spot there is bad.. or if that's someone's spell on top of four others.<br />
<br />
addendum / edit: I'm glad Wildstar failed, as much as a part of me wanted it to succeed. It taught the elitist the world doesn't revolve around me. As I keep repeating: Without &quot;filthy casuals&quot; -- you have no one to subsidize the game for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granted, I didn't like the whole casual route they had planned out. <br />
<br />
What they should do is just drop the EQ 1 code into the EQN engine and update the gameplay/abilities accordingly. Take something that works (EQ1), borrow what else works (modern MMO gameplay), and add on your innovation (EQN engine). That's a far better formula than telling the most hardcore MMO'rs you are going to make the most casual MMO and forget any continuity.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">splatomat</div><div class="date">2016-03-14, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i wonder if blizzards lack of competition also contributes to their seeming lack of effort in WoD.<br />
<br />
i remember usually when a &quot;wow killer&quot; would come out they'd do something to offset the release of the competitor's mmo, now there does not seem to be anything in sight that will motivate them.<br />
<br />
hoping legion has more content than WoD, but who am i kidding ill probably play it regardless.<br />
<br />
THIS. Every time some kiddies gloat over the demise of an MMO I just roll my eyes. First off, thats a lot of real people's lives that just went up in smoke. <br />
<br />
Secondly, competition is GOOD, lack of competition is BAD. Not sure why this simple concept is so difficult for herpyderps to grasp, but we should WANT something to perform as a &quot;WoW killer&quot; because then maybe we wouldn't get turd piles like Warlords. When there are competitors offering a quality product, a product you like might get better as a response.</div></div><hr />

Bravo. <br />
Question why are you still posting games on the main page that are NOT MMO's?<br />
Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Diablo 3, Star Craft, Overwatch and GhostCrawler.</div></div><hr />
