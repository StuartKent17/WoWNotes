It's okay. There is plenty of other stuff to do. Yesterday I soloed 25 Heroic Firelands (Which was actually a challenge) and I just hit exalted with the Netherwing faction for mounts. The point is, there is other content besides HFC. 7.0 prepatch will probably be in June.</div></div><hr />

ICC was full year, Demon Soul 8 months, SoO 14 months and HFC 14 months.<br />

Well I can surely tell you that in just past 2 weeks names in Alpha have been change to Beta. I mean, what was named alpha, now says Beta, even on login screen. So yeah, soon-ish enough.<br />
<br />
Oh and yeah, I expected this release date.</div></div><hr />

How is it a slap in the face? WoD was like 4 weeks early at the most. This is about 2-3 early.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And how very amusing, I believe it was stated at some point that Legion would come out sometime during Summer, and voila, just as I jokingly thought, release on the second-to-last day of Summer! :P<br />
<br />
Oh well, now I have something to look forward to. :)</div></div><hr />

I don't know who plans their timings, but they need to fuck off, or quit, ideally both, in either order. We've been promised since wrath that they would close the gaps between expansions, and not leave tiers going for over a year. And every damn time it's the same story.<br />

They have literally done it every expansion ever and they keep promising shorter gaps and people keep falling for it and they keep lying, yet the solution is right slap in their face - make content for the current expansion and the next<br />
<br />
&quot;It will take longer to get the expansion out&quot;<br />

I guess all that's left to see now is if they can break the game even more than with Warlords, since it's obvious they decided to launch in August no matter what state the game will be in at the time.<br />
<br />
That, &amp; how much your Subs will drop.<br />

I predicted you'd be down to 4 Million by the time Legion launched, I guess I was way off though; you'll be struggling to keep 3 Million by the time 2017 hits like this :D</div></div><hr />

And how very amusing, I believe it was stated at some point that Legion would come out sometime during Summer, and voila, just as I jokingly thought, release on the second-to-last day of Summer! :P<br />
<br />
Oh well, now I have something to look forward to. :)<br />
<br />
Not trying to sound trolly and in no way targeted at just you Wishblade, but I have seen multiple people say this, everyone does realize that Summer's last day is September 21st right? So they are not late. In fact they even said on or before September 21st. So being August 30th is still very much summer. Mind you its very late summer, but they didn't lie. Honestly this is right on par for what I thought they would do launch wise because pushing it until September 21st would cause a bigger rage. Also they are releasing on Tuesday before Labor Day weekend so it works out well timing wise.</div></div><hr />

This is the same exact sentence somebody has said 4 months before WoD was released. You know, with 14 months of SoO. Waiting for this brand new expansion that the new, bigger team surely spent all that time making, so it must be the best thing ever.<br />

WoD started off great though. It would have been amazing had they made 6.1 a story patch, 6.2 a raid, 6.3 a story patch, and 6.4 a raid. Instead we got Selfies and a boring-green raid, which reminds me, why do they keep doing this shit where we kill X Enemy for 14 months then go kill them for another year again? Its fucking boring.</div></div><hr />

Huh, good point. I remembered it being shorter..... Weird.<br />

Interesting, their duration will end up being almost identical then, though Hellfire would still manage to be a few days longer (technically), coming in at a total of 14 months, 1 week compared to 14 months, 4 days.<br />

Well, if we we had legacy realms, or hard-mode realms where all content remains challenging enough for the intendend level (ie actually getting a decent experience in locking your exp at 80 and running WotLK raids), this wouldn't be such a problem tbh =P<br />
<br />
Sure, we'd still have no new content, but at least you'd be able to enjoy between 35 raids, instead of just 1 or 3.<br />
Or between 78 dungeons instead of just 8 :D<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly expected it to be early August tbh =P Will be a greatly wasted opportunity if they don't release the pre-patch (with class changes, demon hunter, and the introductory content) with or shortly after the movie release, especially if they do end up doing the whole &quot;1 ticket = 1 battlchest&quot; deal; but not really seeing a pre-patch lasting for 3 months.. but then again wouldn't be a great shock.</div></div><hr />

There isn't much they could do, throwing money at people doesn't make them learn company specific standardization and quality, nor does it teach you how to develop on certain platforms faster. Blizzard clearly miffed up somewhere when they should have had more Devs all along, but no one should act like they don't know why the past 2 cycles were shitty, they just strait up didn't have the man power. Vote with your wallet.</div></div><hr />

The timing of adding on the developers were really stupid. It was mid-development that they had to add on 250 employees and bring everyone up to speed, which is just asinine when the game wasn't even ready to be launched. They probably could've done a better job and delayed Legion while providing content with WoD -- but I'm sure Blizzard saw it as a better gain to just drop WoD sooner rather than later.</div></div><hr />

Honestly this is right on par for what I thought they would do launch wise because pushing it until September 21st would cause a bigger rage.

They're doing a lot of ambituous stuff with this expansion (whether that stuff will turn out to be good or not remains to be seen), and a lot of features are only rudimentally implemented currently. Some of the new features also definitely need some more iteration, and on a purely technical level they're making a lot of changes to the core systems (interface and graphics options, transmogrification, etc.).<br />
<br />
At this point I'm willing to wait. I've been waiting this long already. I just want it to be good. At least as good as Mists of Pandaria was, hopefully. So long as it's fun and they support it with robust post-launch patch content, it'll be fine. Frankly, I think Warlords of Draenor would have been perfectly fine if they'd kept pumping out content. People complain about the garrisons being boring, but IMO that's just a symptom of their being nothing else to do in the game at max level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it is.<br />
<br />
Is it releasing during summer? Yes.<br />
<br />
Therefore it's true.<br />
<br />
You can't go into some rant to break down a fact if it's a fact. If something is true, it's true.<br />
<br />
Unless you're attaching the &quot;technically true&quot; to the Dec 31st to Jan 1st thing, in which case that argument was so nonsensical and unrelated I blocked it out because it was shameful to even use that as a point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Famous last words.<br />
<br />
To be fair though, one of the biggest issues with the WoD launch were the garrisons where every player needed a separate instance. We do have Class Halls this time, but they're shared among several players.<br />
<br />
But yeah, I'm not sure that'll be enough to save the servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I disagree with point 3. WoD has given a LOT of content. Remember, the majority don't raid.<br />
<br />
Wait im not a raiding what content has wod given use ? the normal leveling zone content and tanan jungle ? every expansion since wrath has given us less and less and thats a fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Typically the solution from companies isn't &quot;lel quit I don't care&quot; it's &quot;what can we do to make it right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizzard has adopted the &quot;lel fek u just quit playing if you don't like it :^)&quot;<br />
<br />
But not everyone has the same issues as you, it's all completely subjective in a video game. I've been here since day 1 and I still love the game as much as I did back then. I've had countless friends who played, most don't nowadays. And it's not because of the decisions the developers made, it's because the morons grew up, got married, made babies, and got lost in the American Nightmare. (I'm a only a tad bitter about that.)<br />
<br />
I will admit, I am not in Alpha. But I am hawkishly following the streamers and videos, and I like what I see. I liked WoD from day one and like it the same now (Garrisons blow, but I just ignore that part of the game.)<br />
<br />
I know YOU feel differently, and you're expressing those feelings. Maybe I don't understand what exactly is making you so angry.<br />
<br />
What exactly do you want them to &quot;make right?&quot; What is so wrong with the game?</div></div><hr />

If the doomsayers are correct there won't be any players to cause server issues</div></div><hr />

So much for their faster expansion BS, I guess it's time to unsubscribe august is too far away to continue paying them.<br />
<br />
You're an angry little elf aren't you? :)<br />
<br />
Im happy that they are releasing in August. It is the perfect amount of time to get things done before then! Think of all the stuff you could be doing to prepare! You could be saving up a nice stash of gold (like I am, currently at 2.2m), completing all raids, and doing some nice surfing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unholyground</div><div class="date">2016-04-18, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But I mean, it has happened, in regards to many things Blizzard has done alone?<br />
<br />
Flying, that RealID name fiasco, dungeon difficulty during Cataclysm (even though that was absurd)<br />
<br />
I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting.<br />
<br />
Outrage and anger is good - silencing that sort of stuff is bad and it closes avenues of discussion and reason. A forum where everyone agreed on everything and it was all peachy-keen would be extraordinarily boring and I'm sure you agree.<br />
<br />
Of course, I agree they have made bad decisions for sure, some they have fixed some they haven't. I am not saying it is not worth discussion but you can't buy into their product after repeat failures and then continue to moan and groan when you can just move on. Hope is only good for so long before it becomes a mental issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fucking content gaps. You can't say &quot;this time for real!&quot; and &quot;the team is bigger than ever!&quot; over the course of 6 years and DELIVER ON ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. There wasn't even a fucking middle tier in WoD to blame it on. It was literally one additional raid past the launch plus a zone that should've been in at launch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaylock</div><div class="date">2016-04-18, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I stopped WoD the day Hellfire dropped. And guess what not only have I saved over $200.00 I didn't miss a thing in reality (skipping shipyards alone was worth $200.00).<br />
<br />
But 14 months between WoD and Legion is just pitiful especially when you consider 3 things:<br />
<br />
1) the repeated lie about faster release cycles that Blizzard had to know wasn't plausible / going to happen<br />
<br />
2) the fact that Legion, as Blues have said themselves, is really the continuation of WoD and that work had started on it before WoD was even released<br />
<br />
3) the gob-smacking lack of content in WoD (which will still end up tied for longest expansion cycle despite missing an entire tier etc)<br />
<br />

<br />
Therefore it's true.<br />
And I didn't say it wasn't true.<br />
<br />
I said (or more correctly, intended to imply) that it's deceitful to call it a &quot;summer release!&quot; because that term -- whether you want to admit it or not, and we all know you don't -- implies that it was released in and more importantly for the summer. Not the ass end of it so they can just say that it was a summer release. It's practically right up there with lawyer-jargon.<br />
<br />
But hey, if you don't understand how it's exactly the same as saying that a December 30th, 2015 release is a &quot;2015 release!&quot;, there's no rationalizing with you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right?<br />
<br />
Honestly, with the exception of the fucked up states of specs right now, it realistically should be. Zones are pretty much done, raid/dungeon testing is heavily under way, professions are in and relatively functional, etc.</div></div><hr />

If prepatch hits live in middle June, I am perfectly okay with september release. If it hits live in the middle of July or later, I am angry as f***.<br />
<br />
I kind of feel distorted over this. On one side, I want the game to be done, like actually done, you know, the fabled Blizzard quality we rarely get to see nowadays - no bugs, no lags for seven days since day1 like was in WoD, etc. On the other side, I feel so sad that Blizzard completely wasted such an awesome advertising opportunity with the movie.</div></div><hr />

It is a 2015 release though. It's dirty, and it's shit, but it realistically, factually is a 2015 release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
14 months of HFC.<br />
<br />
So much for shorter last patches.<br />
<br />
Looks like their talk of &quot;cutting content to ensure faster expansions&quot; was bullshit as well, but then again, I had no doubt in that. <br />
<br />
It's nice to finally have a release date, but WoD failed so much in every aspect that I seriously doubt WoW will ever recover. Looks like Blizzard finally let their flagship game set sail and moved onto something else.</div></div><hr />
