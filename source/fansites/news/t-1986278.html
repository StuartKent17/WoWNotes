Official Reply to Vanilla Servers and Nostalrius<br />
We wanted to let you know that we’ve been closely following the Nostalrius discussion and we appreciate your constructive thoughts and suggestions.<br />
<br />
Our silence on this subject definitely doesn’t reflect our level of engagement and passion around this topic. We hear you. Many of us across Blizzard and the WoW Dev team have been passionate players ever since classic WoW. In fact, I personally work at Blizzard because of my love for classic WoW. <br />
<br />
We have been discussing classic servers for years - it’s a topic every BlizzCon - and especially over the past few weeks. From active internal team discussions to after-hours meetings with leadership, this subject has been highly debated. Some of our current thoughts:<br />
<br />
Why not just let Nostalrius continue the way it was? The honest answer is, failure to protect against intellectual property infringement would damage Blizzard’s rights. This applies to anything that uses WoW’s IP, including unofficial servers. And while we’ve looked into the possibility – there is not a clear legal path to protect Blizzard’s IP and grant an operating license to a pirate server. <br />
<br />
We explored options for developing classic servers and none could be executed without great difficulty. If we could push a button and all of this would be created, we would. However, there are tremendous operational challenges to integrating classic servers, not to mention the ongoing support of multiple live versions for every aspect of WoW. <br />
<br />
So what can we do to capture that nostalgia of when WoW first launched? Over the years we have talked about a “pristine realm”. In essence that would turn off all leveling acceleration including character transfers, heirloom gear, character boosts, Recruit-A-Friend bonuses, WoW Token, and access to cross realm zones, as well as group finder. We aren’t sure whether this version of a clean slate is something that would appeal to the community and it’s still an open topic of discussion. <br />
<br />
One other note - we’ve recently been in contact with some of the folks who operated Nostalrius. They obviously care deeply about the game, and we look forward to more conversations with them in the coming weeks.<br />
<br />
You, the Blizzard community, are the most dedicated, passionate players out there. We thank you for your constructive thoughts and suggestions. We are listening. <br />

if this happened i would cry tears of joy,<br />

being able to actually raid in greens and blues again cause thats all you had, then aquiring an epic and the community going OMFG look at that guys gear hes in the top %, he worked for his gear.<br />
<br />
now its oh that guys been in lfr, and mythic just on colour alone.<br />
<br />
gone are the days where gear made a difference in the playerbase, and the structure and community with it.<br />

How did you read a sincere blue post about it (they didn't need to respond at all) and get all that negativity?<br />
<br />
Cheer up.<br />
<br />
Essentially what he talked about is the same experience people are getting from these nostalgia trips. Turn off everything that's convenient, including flying, group finder and heirlooms. All they need to do is up the health of the mobs and it's the the same experience without the glaring problems of vanilla.</div></div><hr />

Theres no way Id want to go back to the old days of wow. Nostalgia and rose tinted specs seem to be helluva common.

RIP WoW been funLike it or not, of course it's about the money, because it's a business model, at the end of the day, that has made this game (and much of modern society) possible.<br />
<br />
Within that, it's still possible for communities to grow and for meaningful events to take place. But if you remove the money, then everything else falls apart.<br />
<br />
There's no sense complaining about the money that makes it all possible. This is just naivety. You think all these artists and designers and managers and accountants are going to do all this for free?</div></div><hr />

Of course it's about the money they are a business, how else do you think they are suppose to pay their employees and the employee's needs, and how do you think they are able to make heartstone expansions, D3 patches, WoW expansions/patches and Overwatch, a business is always about the money</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Servasus</div><div class="date">2016-04-26, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nostalgia is a very terrible thing, and it's a huge factor that ends up dragging down not only WoW's, but the general World's ability to progress. It's not Blizzard's responsibility to protect an illegal private server. They own the property. The people who ran the private server stole that property and then manipulated it how they saw fit. That is downright ILLEGAL in every sense of the word.<br />
<br />
You might not like the truth, but the truth is that this server was always going to be shut down. It was just a matter of time, and those of you who didn't see it coming are delusional. <br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't need to make nostalgia servers to quench some of your ridiculous thirsts for &quot;the good old days,&quot; which weren't even that good to begin with. The only reason people have fun playing these old servers is because they know deep down what they are doing is against the rules, and that adds excitement. The actual gameplay of vanilla and it's systems was horrible, slow for no reason, and has been vastly improved upon over the years. Sure, WoD was a disaster because of a lack of content at end game, but MoP was one of the best expansions to date, possibly rivaling WotLK and TBC. If half of you nostalgiatards would snap out of your delusion you might see just how awesome a lot of these improvements are.<br />
<br />
It happens with literally everything. Successful film? &quot;Everyone&quot; hates the sequel(s). Successful video game? The sequels &quot;failed.&quot;<br />
<br />
The original excitement you had from playing the first game in a series is never going to come back. That can't be recreated. But letting that lack of &quot;new car smell&quot; ruin your enjoyment of future titles is cancerous. People who think classic WoW was the best WoW era and will never be topped are the same people that lead depressing, sad lives IRL. &quot;I had the best steak ever at this one restaurant 5 years ago and no steak will ever be as good so all steak I have fromt hat point on are bad.&quot; &quot;My first girlfriend/boyfriend did this amazing thing during sex, but we broke up, so sex with anyone else will never live up to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nostalgia seriously ruins people's lives. Don't be that guy who dwells in the past and forgets to actually live during the present and anticipate the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
having 40 people in a raid in greens and blues did make it harder?<br />
and to be ohnest if they were integrated into the same server list we have now and was tied into my sub, yes i would pay for it.<br />
<br />
if it was a seperate paid service not tied in with ym Current sub, i probably wouldnt play it.<br />
<br />
yes Nostalgia is there, but i woudlnt mind it, and seeing people play it as well, going back and hitting mobs for 1-5 hp at lvl 1, and having 40 health and getting hit for 2-3, it was exciting. now days you jsut deck yourself out and run through shit auto spamming your way to max lvl in 1 day.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't even harder, it was much easier if had today's experience, atoning and gearing. People didn't know anything about playing the game yet so everything was harder to them, and beyond that the main way the game was artificially made hard was that it was gated behind very strict barriers of atonements or gear so for instance if you lost a couple of important players on the last Tier you might be screwed since you might need to attone or gear new players all over again, on old tiers. <br />
<br />
The game really became harder on Ulduar where hard mode was something you couldn't do easily even at a time that gearing for it was very easy.<br />
<br />
The game is superior right now in many ways on that. The entry is open to almost everyone very early. It's how you actually play that matters.</div></div><hr />

There is no special need to support &quot;classic&quot; realm. Such server should act as &quot;as is was&quot;. <br />
Also they have lost a lot of subscribers since WOLK so there is a lot of hardware resources to handle 2-3 additional severs.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, don't be silly. You can even ask for additional subscription fee for such realms. Personally I quit WoW because I was bored to death by WoD and now playing on TBC/WOLK pirate servers just to fight a this boredom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
people are simply no honest - most of those who want to play on those realms never played in vanilla and are under influence of idiots with rose tinted glasses - they want legacy servers to experience that content but they have no clue how bad the game was back then really - but blizzard repsonse is nice - they said clear no to legacy servers and only option they give is form of hardcore server with no in game help to leveling - the question is how long before people who would srtat playing there would start to whine to implement them. <br />
<br />
i would also add 1 thing - no account wide achievments and mounts from that server conencted to retail. no plague proto drakes, hands of adal etc etc obtained in 2016+</div></div><hr />

The problem with Vanila servers is, AND PLEASE answer me this, is what people are forgetting is, <br />
aWhat part of vanila AQ 20-40? Naxx? <br />
What about bugs. What bugs should they have fixed? <br />
What about the grafic? - Should it stay true to Vanila level of Look + Grafic or should it be as pretty as it is now?<br />
What about interface? Mass loot, and other stuff.<br />
What about quaility of life services like Mount bag, Titles being Indidual.<br />
<br />
What in 4 years. When people have played lots of vanila, shoudl they end upgrade to TBC server? WHAT if they make one, should you be able to move your currenct Vanila char or have to make a new ones?<br />
How many servers?<br />
What should it cost?</div></div><hr />

Actually what you just wrote is bs<br />
1) Not really. Problem is, that you would have to employ some GM who deal with problems, cheaters etc.. (try imagining wow without support and banning cheaters, and you get diablo on xbox360 where ppl are running with 10M dps rings etc..) And lot of bugs were addressed in later patches, so there would be a lot of security / hack holes<br />
2) Not really again they would be releasing it because ppl want it. And btw judging by the anniversary molten core, people would stop playing it as fast as they would start. Just because it's too hard or comparing to today's wow. Or more like grindy because there is hard content nowadays too.<br />
3) Not really again again. You would still have mounts, pets. Tho yea, by then you had to have your mount in your bag.</div></div><hr />

if it was a seperate paid service not tied in with ym Current sub, i probably wouldnt play it.<br />

yes Nostalgia is there, but i woudlnt mind it, and seeing people play it as well, going back and hitting mobs for 1-5 hp at lvl 1, and having 40 health and getting hit for 2-3, it was exciting. now days you jsut deck yourself out and run through shit auto spamming your way to max lvl in 1 day.<br />

<br />
I'm currently playing on a pirvate vanilla server with an extremely high pop, everyquest is scripted and works, every dungeon, every raid, absolutely everything works, if a few guys from europe can manage to run a 15k+ Private server without the millions of dollars blizzard has at their disposal, it purely is about money and making people play the current version over their old versions. <br />
<br />
With vanilla servers, they can't charge for Cash shops, leveling boosts, pets, nor can they charge for an expansion to come, this is solely a company protecting their bottom line.<br />
<br />
Supply and demand is the cornerstone of capitalism, at the moment, there is a huge demand for the supply, but blizzard won't give it to them because it won't make them as much money as the current product does.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Technical&quot; issues line is a joke, they could very very easily create a few isolated servers outside of the official battle.net system and everyone who wants it, could be happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Private servers are always going to be the only way to play Vanilla, until WoW is down to around 400-500k subs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either way, I'm normally all against bashing Blizzard for dumb shit like this, but I find one of the statements kind of silly. When they go on about making a classic server would be hard work and more or less seemingly impossible to achieve. Yet 30 volunteers managed to keep a fairly popular, active server going for over a year? I would have thought with the billions of dollars + insanely talented individuals working for them they could achieve it VERY easily? <br />

What is this delusion you and some others keep having? Are you perhaps trolling?<br />
<br />
If they wanted to play wow for free, there are other private servers out there with much more recent content than Nostalrius had.<br />
<br />
I'm not particularly fond of going back to Vanilla, mainly because I've seen most of the content already. A pristine realm with current content progressing differently on the other hand seems very interesting. They'd have to get it and the details about it done right before an expansion launch, though. Not in the midst of it, breaking guilds and what not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? Yes, I loved Vanilla. I am kinda nostalgic about it, but I also know it was a game from another time. Some mechanics are simply anachronistic now.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't have the free time I had when WoW was released back on February 11th 2005. The idea of spending hours getting a simply 5 man group as a DPS is something that would make me quit on the spot, nowadays, because well... 2 hours at night is often the best I can do and if over half of those are spent spamming in a capital city &quot;DPS LFG&quot;, well, that's not an engaging evening for sure!<br />
<br />
Though I'm not opposed of it, of course, if that's what people wants. I do have the concern that if Blizzard has to maintain both a legacy and a new server, it would slow things up EVEN MORE enlarging the content drought even further. No, that's not going to cut it, sorry. Vanilla was great, but we're not in the past anymore. Let's focus on Legion being GOOD.</div></div><hr />

I would definetely play on pristine server... even transfer my characters. I dont care if its not vanilla but if i can get rid of LFG-tool and spend hours searching for groups for dungeons.... yes please.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NMX-</div><div class="date">2016-04-26, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the idea here would be to bring back a sense of server identity. Leveling up together. Using summoning stones to get to raids/dungeons. Looking for people on your server, making new friendships. Not doing dungeons/raids with a bunch of ppl where nobody says a single word. Not randomly coming across somebody from a different realm, only that you know you shouldn't make friends with them, because hey, you guys can't really trade stuff with one another. Can't be in each other's guild. It's just not the same as that being on your server.<br />
<br />
With server identity + community, new expansions would be more ... meaningful. You , and your friends, all excited to play with each other in the new content vs what WoW has been today for so many: log in, open a menu, wait, raid, leave. Wait till Tuesday. Repeat.<br />
<br />
And, as for legacy servers, I think running an older versions of the game on some servers for millions of people is, simply put, not a smart decision. It's easy to say, &quot;oh but these people did it!&quot; - I'd like to challenge you to consider that it's way easier said than done. A company like that would have to scale it to a global audience, would have to maintain those servers, and probably have to create a separate version of customer service's tools to work with specifically legacy servers, and then train customer service to use these new tools to fix players' issues.<br />
<br />
and then they'd need to train a bunch of techies and service level people to also keep an eye on these new servers as well. and so on. and so on. and so on. It's so nice and pretty on paper. It's not so pretty in practice.</div></div><hr />

You need to make like a frost mage, bro, and find some chill.<br />
<br />
<br />
The folks who want to play Vanilla obviously don't care about improvements or changes to that state of the game so working on older patches wouldn't be a factor.<br />
Actually I was thinking the other day that offering one or two Vanilla realms on a separate network to the live servers wouldn't be a bad idea. Costs would be relatively low due to the fact that no patch work would need to be done and Blizz could charge a normal sub for people to play on them. Overheads might still be a thing because whether regular maintenance is required or not, there is a cost to running those servers in the first place.<br />
With income from normal subs to allow users to play Vanilla on new servers, Blizz would probably be making money just by offering the platform which they wouldn't have to maintain because the players wouldn't want changes made.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course what income there is to be made off Vanilla nowadays would depend on the player base it gets. TradeChat made an interesting comparison where 500k users wanted classic Runescape to be a thing but then only like 130k of those users were active on it. That said, it wouldn't be viable to absorb the costs to establish Vanilla WoW servers for nostalgic players to enjoy based on outcry of, lets say 7m players only to find only 2m players actively play on them.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, Blizzard made WoW and failing to protect it as their Intellectual Property is a very bad idea and if more players who think they're full of shit were business people and not just &quot;worker bees&quot;, maybe they'd be able to see that.<br />
<br />
I own a software business myself, and I'd be pissed if I were to find someone using my software who had not paid to do so.</div></div><hr />

If WoW was a singleplayer game that worked with a current OS, it would be true. It would be a piece of software running in its little bubble on your computer. Unfortunately there is a huge part of the game that's run on an elaborate server park, that needs to be maintained and kept secure. It has to work with battle.net. <br />

<br />
Though I'm not opposed of it, of course, if that's what people wants. I do have the concern that if Blizzard has to maintain both a legacy and a new server, it would slow things up EVEN MORE enlarging the content drought even further. No, that's not going to cut it, sorry. Vanilla was great, but we're not in the past anymore. Let's focus on Legion being GOOD.<br />
<br />
Thank you, you used all the right words and I am exactly the same, played since Vanilla and I don't think I would want to even consider going back to Vanilla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like absolute garbage. The new game does not work with old game mechanics and the old version doesn't work with new game mechanics.<br />
It's not necessarily about mechanics but the community spirit. Turning off all the &quot;quality of life&quot; feaures would force people to actually interact with eachother and venture out into the world. That is what many nostalgia fans are interested in.<br />
<br />
If I could add something to the turn-off list it would be flying in all expansions. Current flight paths are more than enough for fast and convenient travel. That's all what's really needed.</div></div><hr />

I've been playing WoW since Vanilla and until Wrath of the Lich King came out, the game was fun. Especially the PvP and arena in my opinion. It was simple but the combinations were still there to make sick moves and time the right attacks on the right time to kill your enemy. Now, I feel like I have 100 buttons to press and there are simply too many combinations to play this game in a normal way. I stopped playing at Mists of Pandaria because I felt like the game was too much and it didn't feel like the World of Warcraft I was so passionate about.<br />
<br />
Seeing this blue posts does me good in a way that you guys are also thinking about bringing the old feels back of the game and thinking about possibilities to give the 'veteran players' the fun back. The 'Pristine Realm' immediately made me excited, for me this would be a huge reason to start reconsidering playing again. I will keep following the updates and I truely hope the old feels will get back to the game.<br />

1) They don't want to work on older patches, because it takes much more time compared to current state of the game<br />
2) If they actually do release something &quot;older&quot; it's literally them saying that their current game sucks, go play older version<br />
3) No $$$ to be made there with in game purchases<br />
<br />
It's all about the money, newer expansions wont be sold cos people would be playing older patches.<br />
RIP WoW been fun<br />

Its not an on and off switch like a lot of you like to imply. its not &quot;dump the old code in a server and watch it work with no effort&quot;.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has already researched player behavior in regards to hosting vanilla servers and realized it wont return the investment required and work needed to maintain it later. In other words, its a poor idea doomed to failure, it wont even break even or be sustainable.<br />
<br />
Hosting vanilla servers on the official systems implies a vast amount of work to setup and maintain. A separate client (maintaining two clients will be hell), absolutely new software and its own infrastructure. All for something already proven to not hold enough active interest over time by enough people to even cover the cost of doing the above, let alone maintaining it. Not to mention the opportunity cost implied as resources are put aside for it and not engaged elsewhere in things that do have returns and profits to keep going.(to use an old joke, imagine a few expansions worth of raids lost)<br />
<br />
So yes, when blizz says &quot;you think you do&quot; they say that because random parrots can say whatever shit they want on the net, but the player populations behavior over a long period of time concerning this reveals otherwise. Nost is a big example itself, with the vast majority of registered accounts (a piddly sum compared to official servers) consisting of people who logged in, played for a while before losing interesting and left with a small active population remaining behind. All other private servers reveal the same activity over a period of time.That is not a sustainable model of behavior to follow up on in an official and expensive manner.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but you've just made a complete fool of yourself there. Software will ALWAYS need patching.

1- Hire the people of Nostalrius to manage the vanilla server. <br />
2- Get the server/s to the new battle.net we have now like another wow license.<br />
Those who want to play, pay that license and the guys from Nostalrius are paid from that, the rest is for blizz and if the server/s doesn't make enough to support itself and the new people then puff, it proves to everybody that its not needed.</div></div><hr />

The problem with Vanila servers is, AND PLEASE answer me this, is what people are forgetting is, <br />
aWhat part of vanila AQ 20-40? Naxx? <br />
What about bugs. What bugs should they have fixed? <br />
What about the grafic? - Should it stay true to Vanila level of Look + Grafic or should it be as pretty as it is now?<br />
What about interface? Mass loot, and other stuff.<br />
What about quaility of life services like Mount bag, Titles being Indidual.<br />
<br />
What in 4 years. When people have played lots of vanila, shoudl they end upgrade to TBC server? WHAT if they make one, should you be able to move your currenct Vanila char or have to make a new ones?<br />
How many servers?<br />
What should it cost?<br />
<br />
well blizzard has stated they don't have the vanilla code anymore, so it's obviously a product that is defunct so they shouldn't care if other people want to keep it running. Any game that's over 10 years old should be freeware anyway.<br />
<br />
They don't care that they lost 5 million subs in WoD, why should they care if a few thousand people are playing a game they don't even support anymore, wow has earned them billions of dollars over the years</div></div><hr />

Except for the disabled crossrealm you can play the way he wrote today. Just don't use anything that is boosting xp and only wear white gear (ironman challenge style) and the game is slow and a little bit difficult.</div></div><hr />

For a lot of people this is what they miss the most. Removing cross realm and such would definitely bring back that server community vibe. I like the sort of &quot;action&quot; that comes from cross realm but I can absolutely see where some people may miss the more personal community feels you had when the only people wyou saw around were &quot;Your people&quot;. There was even a kind of nemesis factor to the known opposing faction players and they could just pop up anywhere. Since it was so personal you would be PvP'ing in the world with them just trying to best them because you knew who they were. So theres definitely a lot of the old feels that a pristine server would capture.<br />
<br />
I say even bring back the attunement requirements, all the things that were phased out at somepoint (dont invent new ones but ya know, just make it like it actually was for the orginal attunement lines)</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't mind playing current WoW without the LFG tool. One of my greatest disappointments in WoW has been the decimation of the community and thats something I blame of the group finder. <br />
<br />
You used to get reputations on your server. People from your opposing faction knew to stay clear of you when you were an absolute PvP beast who could take on 5 other players simultaneously - my brother did that in Tol Barad on Spinebreaker-EU back in the day - or you were known to be an easy kill (as in my case at the time).<br />
<br />
Even within your own faction, you became known as a &quot;guild-hopper&quot;, someone who doesn't stick with guilds and attempts only to empty out the guild bank. Or you were known as a stand up dude. You had the players who were the &quot;go to guy&quot; for getting gems and enchants and such...<br />
<br />
WoW used to be a community and while I'm still relatively happy with the game in its current form (indeed, I would give anything at all to play again but my current internet connection is a bit slow for it nowadays), I'd love to go back to a time mechanically where that sense of community can be reestablished.<br />
<br />
Everyone can get anything they need on their own characters now from Garrisons and LFG pretty much nailed closed the coffin on doing anything within your own realm with the other players there. Nobody knows each other anymore and that's the saddest thing to me.<br />
<br />
No more LFG (or at least LFG as it was in Wrath maybe), no leveling boosters... I think it'd be nostalgic enough and enjoyable enough for me.<br />
<br />
It might mean more work to get into raids and such but that again was part of the community thing. You'd become known as a good/bad raider, ninja looter, loot whiner or whatever depending on how you did. It meant that you'd actually have to work to improve your personal gameplay if you wanted to get into end game content because if you sucked, nobody would take you in their raids and they wouldn't join yours either.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard, don't be silly. You can even ask for additional subscription fee for such realms. Personally I quit WoW because I was bored to death by WoD and now playing on TBC/WOLK pirate servers just to fight a this boredom.<br />

<br />
How can this still be thrown around as an argument after Nostalrius becoming so public and seeing the ammount of people that were actually playing it actively (instead of just &quot;daydreaming&quot; about playing it)?<br />
<br />
Yes there has been many substantial improvements to the game, but there has also been a great great shift in design philosophy and direction. The more &quot;objectively-analysable&quot; parts of the game have improved greatly, but the experience it offers is vastly different. For instance there's no denying the graphics are way better now. But you can't say the game looks better than it used to because the aesthetics also changed, and some people prefered how it looked before despite being technologically inferior.<br />
<br />
The same goes for many gameplay, accessibility and reward features and design. You simply can't say that current leveling is better than Vanilla leveling, or current endgame is better than Vanilla endgame, because even if you believe so, that's just your opinion, based on your taste.<br />
<br />
At this point they could practically be independent separate games, with Vanilla being an oldschool MMORPG, with big emphasis on the RPG part, and intended to be played frequently and for relatively long periods of time; and current WoW being a Multiplayer Action RPG, with emphasis on the diablo-ish fast action plenty loot gameplay, intended for relatively short and possibly infrequent periods of time.<br />
<br />
One isn't better than the other, they're just different, and some people like one better, others like the other one. The difference being that the first one is much more fitting of a subscription model than the latter, which seems to be more fitting of a B2P model like Diablo, especial with the ammount and frequency of patches we've been getting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh im sorry did every expansion but hurt you ? like complaining from pandas to cata and bla bla ... Yes game is in terible state but pristine server solves most of the stuff thats bad. I played vanilla and from raiding prospective i dont wanna go back, why should i gather all resistance gear, farm shit tons of mats for buffs,have spells on 6 ranks geting oom from frostbolts,boss mechanics broken or non working properly,boss designs oversimplified,... Yes some peops like vanilla, but many of em are just fallowing flow with nost and stuff,becouse they didnt actualy play vanilla to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah because everyone who played on Nost was a freeloader. stfu. I've had an active WoW account since 2004 and I played there so please, feel free make a bigger fool of yourself. <br />
<br />
Pristine servers sound awful. It's just the current garbage expack minus all the quality of life stuff that makes it bearable.</div></div><hr />

For cry-babies, time = challenge. It will teach them that they have to work to get their rewards.<br />
<br />
As far as difficulty, and die a lot etc, count me in for that. I like that kind of stuff.<br />

<br />
It's not about challenging in absolute terms, but subjective terms. When you spend the time on achieving something ultimately it's not about the reward. It's about personal development and the feeling of accomplishment by conquering your own faults. And conquering your own faults is the most difficult thing to do in the world. To find the motivation, dedication, integrity, strength etc. to do something that takes a lot of time is very difficult. Anyone who tried to improve their physique, getting a dream job, some amount of money, realizing your travel around the world dream etc. goals knows what I'm talking about.</div></div><hr />

Because, apparently, there were many people -and still are- that played vanilla on a private server.<br />
<br />
even more then, why would blizzard even care to be nice to &quot;illegal&quot; players? if they didnt pay then, they certainly wont pay now.<br />
but my point was, sure vanilla wow was a great game, but it's an old game, with terrible mechanics. given the amount of time and energy it would require to implement a vanilla server live i cant help myself thinking that it's bound to fail in the long run. ppl start crying after 2months of same content... i cant imagine they'll last any longer in 10years old content.

<br />
And yeah as for pristine servers, heirloom/lfg or not characters are still immensly overpowered compared to the content and over level it in a heartbeat. I personally wouldn't be interested, but to each his own.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kolvarg</div><div class="date">2016-04-26, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, this early feedback doesn't seem very promising...<br />
<br />
https://www.strawpoll.me/10052507/r<br />
<br />
50% isn't promising? 50% is higher than almost any individual feature in WoW out there. Do you think more than 50% raid regularly? Or more than 50% do pvp regularly? Or more than 50% do pet battles? 50% is huge, especially with the ammount of people WoW involves.<br />
<br />
With that said, I do think pristine realms can't be just about removing the convenience and exp gains. They need to also either buff the mobs or nerf the players on those realms (could be a +%hp +%damage applied on every mob, or a +%damage taken -% damage done on every player).<br />
<br />
Another problem is old content that has been removed. Old zones (removed by cata revamp) could likely be re-incorpurated with some work. Old classes/talents not so much, but if everything else was good (slow and dangerous leveling experience, hard dungeons and raids at endgame) I think it coudl work for a lot of people.<br />
<br />
This doesn't &quot;replace&quot; legacy realms, but it can be a great way of giving a lot of these players a &quot;fix&quot; of more oldschool style of gameplay. If they upped the power of the mobs enough (or nerfed us enough) to the point of it closely resembling that content while current, they could easily make different pristine realms for different intended level caps - ie a &quot;Vanilla&quot; pristine realm with max level locked at 60, a TBC pristine realm with max level locked at 70, so on.<br />
<br />
They could even make that if you get a number (or a very hard to get) Vanilla-related achievement (ie leveling 2 professions to max, doing 50%+ of the raids, completing most of the quests, getting exalted with X reputations, getting X honorable kills, etc) you would win a free transfer for a TBC pristine realm to continue your adventure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fjordkeeper</div><div class="date">2016-04-26, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nostalgia is a very terrible thing, and it's a huge factor that ends up dragging down not only WoW's, but the general World's ability to progress. It's not Blizzard's responsibility to protect an illegal private server. They own the property. The people who ran the private server stole that property and then manipulated it how they saw fit. That is downright ILLEGAL in every sense of the word.<br />
<br />
You might not like the truth, but the truth is that this server was always going to be shut down. It was just a matter of time, and those of you who didn't see it coming are delusional. <br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't need to make nostalgia servers to quench some of your ridiculous thirsts for &quot;the good old days,&quot; which weren't even that good to begin with. The only reason people have fun playing these old servers is because they know deep down what they are doing is against the rules, and that adds excitement. The actual gameplay of vanilla and it's systems was horrible, slow for no reason, and has been vastly improved upon over the years. Sure, WoD was a disaster because of a lack of content at end game, but MoP was one of the best expansions to date, possibly rivaling WotLK and TBC. If half of you nostalgiatards would snap out of your delusion you might see just how awesome a lot of these improvements are.<br />
<br />
It happens with literally everything. Successful film? &quot;Everyone&quot; hates the sequel(s). Successful video game? The sequels &quot;failed.&quot;<br />
<br />
The original excitement you had from playing the first game in a series is never going to come back. That can't be recreated. But letting that lack of &quot;new car smell&quot; ruin your enjoyment of future titles is cancerous. People who think classic WoW was the best WoW era and will never be topped are the same people that lead depressing, sad lives IRL. &quot;I had the best steak ever at this one restaurant 5 years ago and no steak will ever be as good so all steak I have fromt hat point on are bad.&quot; &quot;My first girlfriend/boyfriend did this amazing thing during sex, but we broke up, so sex with anyone else will never live up to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nostalgia seriously ruins people's lives. Don't be that guy who dwells in the past and forgets to actually live during the present and anticipate the future.<br />
<br />
Well said!<br />
<br />
The past is the past. Most nostalgia ridden people probably don't even realize that they simply don't like wow anymore. If you play something for such a long time, you will eventually grow tired of it.<br />
<br />
To preserve wow, they must not go back to some old version of the game but instead do some ballsy revolutionary changes. Most people really crave new and exciting things because most of those warm nostalgia feelings come from a memory of exploring something new and exciting.</div></div><hr />

The biggest difference between Vanilla and nowadays-WoW is the social aspect and the pace of the game.

Honestly I had so many bad experiences in Vanilla, I was cussed out of my guild for not being online long enough each day and I was eventually removed along with some not so nice messages in my mailbox, I got told to go die on multiple occassions because I failed at protecting the King of Ironforge at the time and I wasnt fully PvP geared...

I would play on a pristine realm, but not for long, casually maybe. Nostalgia part is great, but I like to have a new content. Yes WoD wasn't what we expected, but Blizz had more sh.t for that than any other company for a wrong decision. Like there is no other friggin' game in the universe. I was sad, I was very disappointed, but oh well, play something else.<br />
<br />
I understand the Nostalrius case, I personally work with copyright and intellectual properties, people don't understand why it is so important. Even in that scale.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tojara</div><div class="date">2016-04-26, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a question - if legacy servers are so hard to run, how did Nostalrius do it, while pushing the limits of what a server is capable of doing (the players active on it were way more than on any given Blizzard server appearently), with only a team of volunteers who likely have way less experience than anyone working at Blizzard? <br />
<br />
And yeah as for pristine servers, heirloom/lfg or not characters are still immensly overpowered compared to the content and over level it in a heartbeat. I personally wouldn't be interested, but to each his own.<br />
<br />
It's not that they can't it's just how do they do it?<br />
<br />
What's the proper way to do it? Do you just throw the last patch before 2.0 and call it a day? Do you keep all the bugs just to keep the nostalgic feel, or do you make exceptions in different areas? Do you upgrade the server on a per patch period after 'x' amount of days to keep the feel of a vibrant vanilla patch cycle? I mean how far do you actually go with it.<br />
<br />
In some senses graphical improvements, UI improvements, and quality of life things (not group finding, or cross realm) but AoE loot would be welcomed. But would you go that far, or would you just keep everything exactly the same, sans probably bugs.<br />
<br />
Important questions because an official release of something like that would demand far more resources than anything a private server would muster. New product (even if it's old) would attract a lot of people initially, but rest assured, this is still a niche market for them as most people aren't going to want to stick around past the launch of said server. They don't want to release a faulty product, and having too few servers initially would cause problems, and having too many servers initially would be wasteful. I suppose having too few would probably be the best course of action, as it would recreate what I experienced when this game launched for the first time.<br />
<br />
It's really not that simple because again, it's Blizzard property and I'm sure there are thousand different questions that they would have to answer in order to get it just right, and that all goes back to what state the game arrives in, what resources to allocate and how the game evolves in time. This opens the door to TBC legacy, WoTLK legacy, etc as well.<br />
<br />
I don't think they want to cannibalize their own product by focusing on both the future and the past, it splits the population in most cases (unless literally everybody who is interested in vanilla doesn't play anymore, which I doubt). The only way in my eyes to make this happen, and it looks greedy as hell, is to force purchase of current expansion in addition to the regular subscription fee in order to play on their legacy server. That makes people who want to play on legacy both support the current product, in addition to what they want, essentially making both worlds happy.<br />
<br />
Honestly, even though I'm against the idea of Vanilla servers, I think a pristine type, at least how they are positioning it defeats the purpose. In my eyes the best possible server would be one that constantly evolves and is updated. Starts at vanilla, and every 2-3 months it upgrades to the next tier until it eventually rolls over into another expansion.</div></div><hr />

In essence that would turn off all leveling acceleration including character transfers, heirloom gear, character boosts, Recruit-A-Friend bonuses, WoW Token, and access to cross realm zones, as well as group finder. We aren’t sure whether this version of a clean slate is something that would appeal to the community and it’s still an open topic of discussion.<br />
<br />
levelling acceleration was the worst thing added to WoW. there was no need for it once heirlooms were added, but they just keep on cranking it up every expansion. <br />
<br />
too many people these days are focused on the endgame and not on the journey, when the journey is where 90% of the content is at.<br />

The only thing their Pristine servers would do is remove the convenience of leveling quicker for players who have done the content 10+ times. Nothing about the difficulty is different.

Also they have lost a lot of subscribers since WOLK so there is a lot of hardware resources to handle 2-3 additional severs.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, don't be silly. You can even ask for additional subscription fee for such realms. Personally I quit WoW because I was bored to death by WoD and now playing on TBC/WOLK pirate servers just to fight a this boredom.<br />
it's not some flip of the switch, the old code is gone, if they did do it they would have to figure out how to make a lot of old things work with the current systems, making the old talent system work in the new client stands out to me as potentially one of the biggest problems</div></div><hr />

Never, ever in my 11 years of WoW did I drool over what others did or achieved. How shallow is that.<br />

Theres no way Id want to go back to the old days of wow. Nostalgia and rose tinted specs seem to be helluva common. Honestly when you actually start listing all the improvements to the game since vanilla, you see why it should stay dead, and why only folk who have essentially pirated the game play on these servers.<br />
<br />
The sheer amount of people clouded by nostalgia is staggering and stupifying all at once. MADNESS!!<br />
<br />
Take your vanilla servers and ram em. And Im sorry but I dont buy into &quot;I want 40 man raids&quot; or &quot;everything was harder, thus more fun&quot; BS either.<br />

Where X is usually &quot;Activision's acquisition&quot; or &quot;Cataclysm&quot; or &quot;whateverthefuckwewanttobitchabouttoday.&quot;<br />

It's an exceptional level of delusion. Take any class on video game design, even the jankiest, scammiest ones from institutions that advertise on television. I guarantee you within the first month or week of that class, you'll get told that games are designed, from the get go, to make MONEY.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has ALWAYS been about making money. Any company that isn't going to immediately fail is. There's a reason why they scrapped the entirety of Starcraft 1's first version and remade it into what it became. Because they got overwhelmingly negative feedback from their playtest groups. People who wouldn't buy the game because it was redundant and boring in the shadow of Warcraft (among other reasons). <br />

As much as people want to sugar coat their nostalgic feelies and rewrite history, they didn't fix Starcraft during development because they weren't happy with it. They did so to make a bunch of fucking money. That's not to say they aren't trying to make the best games possible (And people claiming this today are just conspiracy nuts who are butthurt about one thing or another), but to sit there and pretend Blizzard never cared about money is just straight up naivety or ignorance. <br />
<br />
As if they couldn't possibly imagine this company that made these games they liked/loved as a kid were interested in profit. It's like the childish part of that nostalgic feel good memory never matured alongside the person thinking it.</div></div><hr />

They're not talking about making a vanilla server, but a server that runs WoD, with a lot of convenience removed.<br />
<br />
Personally i would like it. Them removing cross realm in it means i wouldn't have to deal with trolls. Suddenly you're free if you ignore the few bad apples on your own server, instead of knowing it's futile.<br />
People knowing that if they're not trying to behave they get a negative rep on the server and can't join for much would probably help a lot too.</div></div><hr />

But vanilla was hard.<br />
- If you call grinding hard then you obviously have no idea what hard is, call it time consuming yes, but hard no.<br />
<br />
But vanilla raiding was hard.<br />
- If you call artificially gated and bugged content hard then yes.<br />
<br />
But vanilla was as easy as WoD is now.<br />
- That's why the gap of a good and bad player (or a good and bad guild) with same item level, has never been higher.<br />
<br />
But vanilla was amazing.<br />
- Yes it was, just like other expansions have been, because it was new. New content is always amazing the first time you do it, doing it for another 3 years isn't going to be as amazing, you'll do it once and you'll get bored and stop. Now you see why blizzard won't make vanilla servers? Because you aren't even sure you are going to keep playing it for years. Thus uncertain incomes out of it.<br />
<br />
But Blizzard should listen to the community.<br />
- We all know how that went in WoD, where they tailored to the community and 90% of the active population hated it. <br />
<br />
But Blizzard only cares about money.<br />
- If you are a company, a big one, it's rather obvious you'll care about the profits. Just like you care about your paycheck being correct at the end of the month.<br />
<br />
But why doesn't blizzard hire the nost server guys?<br />
- Because doing that would give incentive to other pirated realms to appear in the hopes of being recruited by blizzard themselves, and it would eventually create a grey area in the legal department that blizzard encourages pirated content and they would eventually lose the rights to defend their own franchise. So you can be sure the Nost guys won't be hired, they'll still get sued, just because blizzard has to, to keep their IP rights.<br />
<br />
But how come Nost could provide servers for free with no funds.<br />
- You can rent servers for as low as 30 dollars per month, that would be well overkill for WoW Vanilla and because Vanilla isn't very taxing on the server, you could easily have a peak population of 100k. Which is succeeding the actual active population of Nost by nearly 20 times. Yes some people checked the Nost claim that they have 150k active players. It actually ended up with around 2-3k players on a daily basis, with double of that in weekends, so take it more like 150k unique players per month.</div></div><hr />

Never in my entire life have I ever witnessed such a cop out response. They have a petition with over 200k signatures and weeks of forum activity and dicussions, a server with 150k active populace and including (according to them) internal discussions. Then, their response is &quot;It would be difficult.&quot;<br />
It blows my mind, if I wrote a thread on the official forums (which hilariously I can't because I stopped playing, super fun echo chamber) criticising a mechanic with such vague and non-constructive weasel words I would expect the thread to be deleted.<br />
<br />
Saying &quot;It's difficult&quot; isn't good enough, and saying &quot;If we could push a button&quot; is a strawman. Nobody is asking them to push a button to do it, they're asking them to do it. Nobody is suggesting it might not be difficult, they want to know why (if at all) it isn't feasible.

- If you call grinding hard then you obviously have no idea what hard is, call it time consuming yes, but hard no.<br />
<br />
Of course it wasn't hard if you compare vanilla leveling to current raiding or something.<br />
<br />
But if you compare vanilla leveling to current leveling, it *was* harder, on top of being more time consuming. That's not opinion, it's a fact: Mobs that used to kill you in 2 or 3 hits in Vanilla now almost literally are unable to kill you even if you just auto-attack them. That sort of &quot;difficulty&quot; might not be exciting to you, doesn't mean it didn't exist or doesn't please others.<br />
<br />
Also your character was just severely under-powered compared to what you get now, not only in the cheer numbers you do, but also in the ammount of abilities you get early on.<br />
<br />
For a mythic raider maybe the difference wouldn't mean much, probably be frustrating. But for someone who enjoys slower-paced gameplay and time consuming long-term &quot;investment&quot; it was amazing - and it works very well with a subscription model.<br />
<br />
For raiding and perhaps endgame in general yes, it was mostly about commitement and how much time you put into it, and I agree it was a high extreme in Vanilla. But then again WoD is a low extreme in how much effort/time is required.<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, be it with legacy realms or these pristine realms, you can see they could please those people and give them more time consuming content while keeping the &quot;normal&quot; realms unchanged, so what's the point of bickering? One isn't better than the other, they're just different, and some people like slower-paced long-term gameplay better.</div></div><hr />

How do you explain that people chose to play on Vanilla private servers when there are other also free, also blizz-like private servers on much more recent content? As recent as MoP or even WoD.<br />

People don't know what a &quot;pristine&quot; realm would actually be like because it doesn't exist yet and they're currently up in arms over Blizzard not immediately giving them exactly what they've been demanding. I hope people realize how good of an idea it is to do this (as long as it's done right). Kind of like a testing ground for everything the real community wants in the game. People want the game to change for the better but if they go against this idea, they're shooting themselves in the foot massively and are pretty much dooming the future of the game. There's no future in legacy servers unless they update them with content which totally defeats the purpose. And people will eventually get tired of it with nothing new being added or fixed. This is a good opportunity to potentially fix WoW by showing Blizzard what we really want.</div></div><hr />

Start a vanilla server with content that were available at 1.0, then progressively release the content over a period of 2-3 years like Vanilla actually did, bear in mind TBC launched way too soon so it could be extended for even more than that. Then either the server gets transformed into a TBC server or everything gets reset again and a new season starts. I did not play much until late TBC and Wrath, but I did play on Nostalrius and my experience of vanilla just from that server is far better than what current WoW has to offer. A lot of people keep saying it's all nostalgia, I knew a whole lot of people on Nostalrius who just like me, had never played vanilla before but was curious about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, I would love to be able to pick a version of WoW and play on a server that has all content excluding pre patches. But it will be a monumental task to get it running and working, let alone working properly if it attracts tons of people in the start, but ending up dead later. Plus, it requires a separate support branch, and probably just an overall expansion on all teams (depending on how they split their stacks). <br />
<br />
It's a shame, but I get it. The pristine server could be fun, although I would really like some sort of &quot;expansion experience&quot; added (i.e. 1-60 full Vanilla, 60-70 full TBC, etc), but I reckon that'd be nigh impossible.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has once again pinpointed their stance on legacy servers, and it is very obvious that they have changed some of their opnion based upon this entire situation. Servers with special features are beginning to look like a possibility, while before it was never gonna happend. I think it is a mature answer, from a company which have to keep looking forward if they want to keep existing.<br />
<br />
I dont really get all the hate this post gets. Sure, they have still killed an illigal private server, but atleast they are giving good reason. That they have even taken their time to create some communication with the Nost people is even beyond what was expected. They are hopefully gonna have a talk about what really made Nost appealing and ,maybe, just maybe, we are going to see what that collaboration will bring, before the end of Legion.<br />

<br />
In my subjective opinion, the aforementioned changes would be a big step towards what community expects from the game. But looking at the current state of gameplay, I am afraid those changes would not suffice. Looking at the talent 'trees' disappoints, so do the restrictions we are given, such as class-armour-penalty for not wearing your class' armour type. Everything feels effortless... speaking of which, oh yes, we have garrisons! Flight points were added to every minor village or camp. (which you don't even need since you get to fly all over the world) What is next, class halls? Oh &quot;I can't wait&quot;.<br />
<br />
I could go on... but what I meant to say was, we loved the freedom we used to have. We, as players, do not like to be increasingly restricted in what used to be loose...<br />
<br />
Maybe if that returns, I would resubscribe to such jewel of a game. <br />

So you are picking the responses that you like and base your opinion on that?<br />
<br />
That saddly is not the right way..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allenseiei</div><div class="date">2016-04-26, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The pristine realm concept is early, indeed, but unless it changes a -lot- about the current game, I would still not be convinced.<br />
<br />
In my subjective opinion, the aforementioned changes would be a big step towards what community expects from the game. But looking at the current state of gameplay, I am afraid those changes would not suffice. Looking at the talent 'trees' disappoints, so do the restrictions we are given, such as class-armour-penalty for not wearing your class' armour type. Everything feels effortless... speaking of which, oh yes, we have garrisons! Flight points were added to every minor village or camp. (which you don't even need since you get to fly all over the world) What is next, class halls? Oh &quot;I can't wait&quot;.<br />
<br />
I could go on... but what I meant to say was, we loved the freedom we used to have. We, as players, do not like to be increasingly restricted in what used to be loose...<br />
<br />
Maybe if that returns, I would resubscribe to such jewel of a game. <br />
But until then, privates are my substitute.<br />
<br />
I hope vanilla isn't your idea of &quot;freedom&quot;.</div></div><hr />

... that's because the resource required to run Vanilla legally would directly detract from/impair the development of future content, surely you can understand that? Blizzard arent going to hire a whole new team to work on something with such a finite user base and shelf life</div></div><hr />

<br />
- literally he says nothing.<br />
- blizzard never explains WHAT should cost that much money.<br />
- nostralius did. its laughable for blizz to do.<br />
- they always talk about patching vanilla, 2nd codebase blah blah. nobody needs patches. <br />
- pull it out like it is, with all ups and downs incl bugs, imbalance etc. - its a simple classic server<br />
<br />
the simple truth is: if 1/3 of the retail players would switch to a classic server they damage their own retail product marketing. its literally a proof how shit retail is. and thats what they fear. why ? because you cant make MORE money with old stuff than with new stuff. so its always a money loss to compete with your own product. and at blizz its all about money. and thats just the ONLY reason for all their descissions. simple as that.</div></div><hr />

People have misconceptions about things and overestimate their opinion and easily fall into confirmation-bias. Big whoop.<br />
<br />
That happens on both sides and on pretty much every subject, and the people that do that do not represent everyone who share their opinion/taste.<br />
<br />
Take the bickering aside and the specifics of illegal vs legal, moral vs immoral, and what you get is people telling others they shouldn't enjoy what they do enjoy (from both sides).</div></div><hr />

BLIZZARD! Please don't feed us with all that nonsense we heard for years and start taking us seriously!!<br />

No, I will not play on pristine servers.<br />
Yes, I'd pay 15$ for a CHOICE to play on Vanilla, TBC, WotLK, Cata, MoP, WoD, Legion. For obvious reasons I wouldn't play on the last four, but I'd gladly play on all three first.<br />

<br />
Are u nostalrius players really this thick?<br />
<br />
Ofcourse blizzard has investigated if this idea was financially feasable , and every1 with half a brain can see why its a terrible move to make legacy servers.<br />
<br />
Now thx for the reply and move on making legion a nice expansion, the nostalgia kids will move with their lives in a few months and we can al forget what happened with nostalrius<br />
<br />
who is stupid, can be easily seen by the fact that you can't read.<br />
<br />
Who the hell talked about legacy server, stupid?<br />
<br />
A pristine server is current release server with few or none QoL features, stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said it clearly enough in my opnion. i have tried to use private servers before and that requires some outside tweaking/do something outside the game. They would need to make a lot of changes to the current UI, the current Battle-net and to the current nost server. They have to make sure that neither Nost server or live server is being neglected and that requires some preparation. So yeah, i do understand the &quot;it requires a lot of work from our side and its difficult&quot; answer.<br />
So the answer is right there! Sure they could use page upon page to explain the specific programming challenges they would have infront of them if they were to implement Legacy/pristine servers, but it would just be a wall of text for most people.<br />
<br />
So you call it a childish answer if you like. I can set myself in their position as a developer and i understand. I think that is very mature in my opnion.</div></div><hr />

Nostalrius alone had 150k+ active players, petition at over 230k players, if even 100k players decided to pay £10/€15/$20 a month or whatever it is these days, you're already talking a revenue of 100k a month.

... and of course you'd be happy to maintain all those individual client installations and addon versions on your PC right? You wouldnt expect Blizzard use their resources to come up with some client versioning technology that managed this for you? No, of course you wouldnt.</div></div><hr />

I think its YOU that has a complete disconnect with how much money Blizzards shareholders would demand as a rate of return on investment. 100k a month would be swallowed up (many times over) by the salaries of the staff required to run it, thanks for illustrating my point perfectly though :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Speedlance</div><div class="date">2016-04-26, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard could have easily sued Nostalrius for money loss and player loss, true or not the case was easy to win. But instead blizzard chose to warn and give them a clear order of what to do. <br />
Nostalrius complied right away and this brought blizzard into discussions with them instead of the worst case scenario.<br />
<br />
It's clear that the people of Nostalrius did well with very little funds and a lot of volunteer work and they didn't earn any money. This is why Blizzard want to talk to them, maybe they can hire Nostalrius crew, then let them run an officially supported server but still privately owned by Nostalrius. <br />
Vanilla server through private means may not be an option now because of the laws are not in favour or sharing property without losing your rights for it. <br />
Blizzard let them run it as long as it was possible without risk of losing rights for their ip.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No they wouldn't, they would be able to keep the current UI. Why do you think they would need to make lots of changes?<br />
<br />
<br />
They have to make sure that neither Nost server or live server is being neglected and that requires some preparation.<br />
<br />
So what if they do? You're confusing &quot;some difficulty&quot; with &quot;not feasible.&quot;<br />
That's why it's an awful answer from them. To merely say &quot;It's difficult&quot; isn't an answer if they don't say WHY it's difficult or WHY it's too difficult. Too difficult being the key part.</div></div><hr />

However, the main reason people play older versions is the content and the way the game played, and playing the current game in a &quot;Pristine&quot; version isn't really the same. How about implement classic/progression servers only during the times of content droughts on the live game? I'd even pay a few dollars more for access (similar to the Arena server system) and it would give players more to do.</div></div><hr />

being able to actually raid in greens and blues again cause thats all you had, then aquiring an epic and the community going OMFG look at that guys gear hes in the top %, he worked for his gear.<br />
<br />
More like 90% of players have epics immediately because you can't put the genie of greater game knowledge and experience back in the bottle, and they are sneering at the pathetic newbs who are still in greens and blues - and certainly not inviting them into any raid groups after the first week the server goes live.</div></div><hr />

I think this would add a lot of what ppl r looking for in old vanilla, as well as continued work on the game itself to add some vanilla like qualities to the game.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't play on a vanilla server, the combat and balance is terrible. There r plenty of things that r bad about vanilla, and I think a vanilla server would not do well long term. U think not getting any content for months is bad? A vanilla server would nvr get any content, there would be no hope in ur favorite spec getting fixed or becoming viable. A lot of specs were unplayable in vanilla.</div></div><hr />
