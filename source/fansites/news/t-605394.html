Another week of 2.4 testing is starting ! Obviously the amount of new items/quests is much lower now that most of the content is known, however keep in mind that the Season 4 items are included in this patch and 99% of them are still unknown (see this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=4573.0) for the few items already discovered on PTRs), it wouldn't be surprising if Blizzard decided to activate them on PTRs at some point just to balance a few things. This post might be updated in a few hours depending on how fast I can work with Photoshop ^^<br />
<br />
of the Shattered Sun ...<br />
Ever wondered what's the point of leveling your Shattered Sun Offensive reputation to exalted if you don't need the epic jewelcrafting patterns (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/) or the shiny Tabard ? I never took the time to talk about it, but there is actually a nice reward for people reaching Exalted with the Shattered Sun Offensive : a new title ! The only thing you'll need to complete this quest (beside being Exalted) is a &quot;small&quot; fee of 1000 gold, that's the price to pay to be &quot;............ of the Shattered Sun&quot; ! (Screenshot from Elitistjerks Forums (http://forums.elitistjerks.com))<br />

<br />
<br />
Hawkstrider/Elekk PvP mounts are back !<br />
Blizzard is trying once again to include Hawkstriders and Elekks as PvP mounts rewards in the game, both mounts are now available from PvP vendors (#1 (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/elekkshop.jpg), #2 (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/swiftwarshop.jpg)) on PTRs and even if they're still bugged (wrong color or icons), the [item=34129] and the [item=35906] are definitely here.<br />
<br />

Enchant Cloak - Steelweave<br />
A few days ago I posted a screenshot for a new cloak enchantment : Enchant Cloak - Steelweave (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/enchantsteelweave.jpg). Good news, we also know where [item=35756] drops now ! It looks like it drops from bosses in Heroic Magister's Terrace (Delrissa confirmed, but you can probably get it from any of the boss here).<br />

Arenas - Mind vision disabled in 2.4<br />
I don't think this was reported in the patch notes, you will not be able to use Mind Vision in arenas after the release of patch 2.4. This was disabled because currently, casting Mind Vision on a player that's drinking causes the player drinking to stand up and cancel their drinking.<br />
Q: Currently, casting Mind Vision on a player that's drinking causes the player drinking to stand up and cancel their drinking. This plays a huge problem in conjunction with the drinking change. Priests will be able to prevent a player from drinking the entire area due to Mind Vision requiring no LoS and infinite range.<br />
<br />
A: Mind Vision will not currently work in Arenas with patch 2.4.0. We are working on a technical fix for this in the meantime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Midsummer feedback on PTRs<br />
Kisirani (who is part of the team creating all the Holiday events in WoW) posted a few words about the Midsummer festival testing going on PTRs.<br />
First, if you've noticed, you can now purchase most of the old, discontinued quest rewards for blossoms. We've also hooked it up so that characters who had the quest &quot;A Light in Dark Places&quot; (completed, mind you) in their quest log that were waiting to turn it in can do so. I don't believe we'll be removing the XP from the quests. If anything, many of the buffs and the like from this event further support the gaining of experience. If you wish to remain static at one level, that is your choice, but it is not a choice we necessarily support, and as a result you may miss out on rewards from quests.<br />
<br />
And just because we're testing midsummer content, it doesn't mean the patch is releasing in the summer. Event content like this is always patched in early and then lies latent until the time is right.<br />
<br />
As a reminder, the biggest addition to the Midsummer festival is probably Lord Ahune.<br />
<br />
Lord Ahune<br />
Lord Ahune (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/lordahune2.jpg) is a new Headless-horseman-like boss, you will be able to fight him during the Midsummer Festival (June 21 - July 5) and after a small fight he might reward you with a few epics. That's a daily quest and you'll be able to summon him once a day.<br />
<br />
Phase 1 - The boss spawns two types of adds and you can't really damage him, just take care of the adds and after a minute, Ahune will go into phase 2.<br />
Phase 2 - Ahune submerges (ragnaros-style) and its Frozen Core will spawn, that's when you attack him. After some time Ahune will emerge and you'll have to fight adds for one more minute before he submerges again, etc ...<br />

Titles must be something rare, something you do for it, but farming reputation and paying 1k gold for a title is it not worth it... I mean, what's so special about that? Everything the title says to other players is like: &quot;Uh, farmed rep, payed money. So what?&quot;<br />
<br />
But okay... I'm not a developer though.</div></div><hr />

Victorie of the Shattered Sun, wtf that doesnt look nice. It seems like theres a missing word :S, like hero or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It should be hard to get...but to be honest, I'll probably get it anyway. Which is a shame, cos its worthless lol.<br />
<br />
I'll keep my &quot;Hand of A'dal&quot; title to be honest, at least that means something....<br />
<br />
Because with attunments being dropped, being BT attuned before they get dropped is an achievement I guess.<br />
<br />
Paying 1000g isnt.</div></div><hr />

Re Title : money flows aplenty in BC, suspecting Ebay or whatever just because you don't manage to save any is stupid. Especially with all the new dailies that will be available and people wanting to do the max of them in order to farm their reputation.<br />

i don't know the exact math... but we can assume legendary items can hold more mod points than an epic item can.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Level_(Item)<br />
<br />
notice it does not list the multiplier for legendary items... but i'd bet that it has a better multiplier than an epic.<br />
<br />
also, sunwell t6 gear = ilevel 159.</div></div><hr />

it kinda sucks to see that the developers are putting absolutely no effort into the game anymore... and make it that obvious. i mean all that stuff looks like: &quot;dude i need a few new armor sets by tomorrow, they dont have to look nice or appealing just make something that looks different from what is already in the game and dont care about details. We just need to give them stupid idiots something new so they keep p(l)aying and dont think were lazy.&quot;</div></div><hr />

OMG people will never be happy with anything new that comes out will they? The graphics look fine, compare them to the stuff we were using before Naxx came out. Quit playing if it's so bad... I for one think Blizzard usually does a great job with development, not just putting out the same crap all the time like EQ used to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Each ilvl is about .65dps for 1-handers, so S3 one-handers should be around 111.3dps.<br />
<br />
I think it's funny that the weapons are gunna be better than basically everything in the game. Presumably the only better loot will come from Kil'Jaeden, and unless he drops 2 ranged weapons, we'll only see a better Ranged weapon with the Legendary bow.<br />
<br />
Hopefully Season 4 comes out about 3-6 months after Sunwell or so, to give PvE'ers time to catch up by farming Kil'jaeden.</div></div><hr />

they didnt even make a set for each class ... just plate leather mail and cloth - talk about lazy ...<br />
<br />
and the sets before naxx were just fine, each was very unique, if you look at the s4 sets they almost all look the same with different shoulders and slightly different helms und UGLY colors</div></div><hr />

Naxx was T3, was barely seen by most WoW players and even most guilds. SWP Gear is more like 6.5, it is not an official Tier set so of course they wont put to much effort into it. Its very similar to the AQ sets if you were playing then. Of course they have to throw out new items, with new raids, but why put so much effort into something that is going to be quickly replaced. If your going to anticipate things anticipate actual Tier sets, or WotLK if anything else.</div></div><hr />

I guess killing Kil'Jaeden, being part of a 25 man raid, getting the Apolyon to drop, and being awarded the sword isn't reward enough to have something better than a few hours of work in 2s.</div></div><hr />

Wake up, this PvE weapon is rare from last boss of last raid instance. PvP sword will be available to everyone who can get 1850 rating or who will buy boost. ::) ::) ::)</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/apolyon.jpg<br />
<br />
4,3 DPS less (with the haste on Apo even more) and the stats are weaker even if u count the 3 red sockets out... with the 3 red sockets filled with epic str gems u get an aditional 30 str and 6 stam which is far to much in comparison (186 AP und 81 Stam for Apo and only 104 AP and 69 Stam for S4)<br />

@Boubouille<br />
<br />
While searching for Apolyon i recognized how many different posts there are about 2.4 items amd things... how about merging some stuff together in 1 or 2 threads ? :)<br />
Keep up the good work.<br />
<br />
<br />
maybe apolyon is more difficult to get than s4.<br />
<br />
if you see end bt/hs caster 1h/2h, bows etc have more dmg than s3 so i dont know why nerf it</div></div><hr />

<br />
that is correct, s4 shouldn't be as good as apolyon. its still pretty damn amazing, but i would venture to guess most people will have s4 before they have a shot at apolyon.</div></div><hr />
