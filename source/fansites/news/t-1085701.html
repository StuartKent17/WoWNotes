Update: Added tonight's Blue Posts, which address some questions about the difficulty change.<br />
<br />
Dragon Soul Difficulty Change - Power of the Aspects to 10%<br />
During the scheduled server maintenance on the week of February 28, the “Power of the Aspects” spell will grow more powerful, reducing the health and damage dealt of all enemies in the Dragon Soul raid by 10%. This spell will grow progressively stronger over time to reduce the difficulty and make the encounters more accessible. The spell will affect both normal and Heroic difficulties, but it will not affect the Raid Finder difficulty.<br />
<br />
Don’t need the help of the Dragon Aspects? The spell can be disabled by talking to Lord Afrasastrasz at the beginning of Dragon Soul.<br />
<br />
We hope you continue to enjoy Dragon Soul, and that these changes encourage you to attempt a higher difficulty, or just keep pushing to down that next boss.<br />

Dragon Soul Difficulty Reduction<br />
MMO Champ JUST published a blog about how effective the 5% nerf was. As the graph indicates, progress is continuing at a healthy, linear rate. It hasn't leveled off. Why are you nerfing heroic mode, again? You explicitly told us that you would not continue with blind nerfs on auto pilot.<br />
We're not &quot;nerfing blindly.&quot; Keep in mind that, the debuff can be disabled. So if you and your Raid choose to do so, you can take on the encounter without it. We also explained our thought processes in the original announcement blog about the debuff here (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/4326384/Dragon_Soul_Difficulty_Changes-1_18_2012).<br />
<br />
Despite arguments to the contrary, there is a choice involved here. You can choose to leave the debuff on or turn it off. If you're looking for the challenge that doing the raid gives you without the debuff and your raid group isn't interested in turning off the debuff, that is still a choice that is being made. No one is forcing that on anyone. If you personally feel forced, then it may be an option to find another group that is interested in the challenge of doing it without the debuff. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the debuff affords those that want to progress a bit, who have experienced difficulty, more of a leg-up. <br />
<br />
It's fine to disagree with us on this, but please make sure that you continue to do so in a constructive manner and refrain from starting flame wars or posting harassing/defamatory language toward posters in the thread. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/217887-you-said-you-wouldnt-nerf-ds-blindly/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4079621819?page=5#91)) <br />

Dragon Soul Difficulty Reduction<br />
And yes, maybe I'm a special snowflake who likes recognition. But I argue that the game is now somewhat built around recognition since achievements were added to the game.<br />
We understand that there are players out there who do what they do for recognition and--dare I say it?--glory. Since we'll likely continue to use a model where we introduce a raid, then slowly remove roadblocks over time, there's a possibility that we could do something akin to adding a feat of strength for players who defeat an encounter in a non-debuffed incarnation, or possibly time-stamps on the armory raid progression section. At the very least, there are options on the table for the future. These aren't things we'll be able to do for Dragon Soul though.<br />
<br />
Nobody is getting held up by 5% or 10% damage and health on bosses, they're getting held up by mechanics.<br />
When a group is really close to taking down a boss, but just can't seem to manage it, a bump like this is sometimes enough to see them on to the next challenge. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4081811999?page=1#13))<br />

Well they did pretend like they could alter the rate at which the buff would be handed out based on &quot;how many guilds had progressed through DS.&quot; But yeah as you said, no one should be surprised, really..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
because intelligent thought is rare among the complainers.<br />
<br />
Question for people who do computer programming. How unfeasible would it be for Blizzard to make the levels of the buff togglable?<br />
<br />
By that I mean, as it is now it is all or nothing, but whatif a guild was wiping on 5% the week before the 10% buff dropped. How difficult would it be to code in so that they could chose to keep it at 5%, instead of going for 10% or 0%</div></div><hr />

LFR/Norm/heroic... who cares, right? As long as people have fun and get their shiny loots because that's what it's all about! Not about &quot;being better&quot; or any such nonsense... who wants to learn how to play better when Blizz tosses raid nerfs at players like candy.</div></div><hr />

They never said the buff would get stronger by 5% each month. They said they'd monitor how the buff affected things and then may increase the buff as they felt it was needed. They could have left it longer. At no point was 1 month stated.</div></div><hr />

Last month the first thing he did was turn the 5% buff off, because it was &quot;bullshit&quot;. I told him that you still can't position Zon Ozz correctly, and as a result wipe on him all the time. Also this group is still 5/7 normal after 2 months of raiding DS together, so we're turning it back on. I would venture to guess most idiots don't even realize that they need the buff, and would rather bitch about it due to some superiority concept they have in video games.</div></div><hr />

If things are going as fast as they go now, then in 3 months DS will have a 25% damage and health reduction, at that moment people are more and more geared so the Raid will be even on HC mode a walk over. I think if this will go slower, as in once per month instead of twice, the raid will keep people playing longer.Food for thoughts!</div></div><hr />

it's been a month, once a month, that's exactly what they did with ICC. Actually it's a few days short of a month but that's more to fit their maintenance schedule. it was either do it 3 days early or few days late.</div></div><hr />

What is this tripe? No guild needs this buff, we were progressing, albeit slowly, without it. No one needs the buff, it's simply a case of playing better. Practise and getting better is what should be paramount, not, just want and we'll lower the bar for you, don't bother trying to achieve anything of worth, it won't matter.<br />

No, these nerfs are not for us. We've started raiding since like 3 weeks and doing 1 night raiding per week. We have progressed 6/8 by now, and we want the 2 remaining bosses still be a small challenge for our casual group. You don't get it, we are having fun while doing balanced encounters rather than having the content finished without any fun. So this is probably for those who have finished all heroic modes and just want to have easier time farming.</div></div><hr />

Isn't that why anyone buys a game? What makes a game fun is overcoming the challenge of it, it's why you rarely if ever see any successful games without a challenging aspect to them. Hell, even sandbox games offer challenge once you expand it enough.</div></div><hr />

Typical Blizzard coercion disguised as a choice. Imagine going to a restaurant ordering a 3 course meal, and the restaurant has an offer whereby you get the last course free, or you can alternatively choose to buy it; only an idiot would do the latter, and that's what we're seeing here folks.<br />

if you're solely looking for a challenge then turn off the stupid buff... i do agree, people having the same pixels you have and got it off an easier version of the boss might be troublesome if the sole reason you play the game is because you have shineys that others don't...<br />

I agree that progression should be earned, it's not like an LFR pug will be waltzing into HM DS and clearing it in an hour and a half... a 10% tweak does not mean that everyone will be sitting in Org/SW on a Heroic DW Drake...<br />
<br />
however, for guilds that aren't amazing either due to their outlook on raiding or the lack of recruiting available, it is nice to be able to progress...<br />

<br />
Top guilds have long cleared Dragon Soul and aren't playing until MOP. They could care less about the nerfs.<br />
<br />
The majority of players &amp; guilds are still progressing through normal and heroics. For the majority of these people they will not sit stuck on a boss for 2 months (probably far less time).....they would just quit. That would be lost revenue on top of the subs that are already gone from the top guilds. Blizzard is selling you hope......hope of downing that next boss with a little more assistance each month. <br />
<br />
Bottom line its to keep the people blizzard makes their main profit from happy and continuing to sub to the game. You don't have to like it but continuing to say it lets undeserving ppl see content are the same underserving ppl you can thank for continuing to have this game to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Question for people who do computer programming. How unfeasible would it be for Blizzard to make the levels of the buff togglable?<br />
<br />
By that I mean, as it is now it is all or nothing, but whatif a guild was wiping on 5% the week before the 10% buff dropped. How difficult would it be to code in so that they could chose to keep it at 5%, instead of going for 10% or 0%<br />
<br />
Depends. If you want it to work like: the buff is 25%, I want to turn off 10% of that, are you then locked for the rest of the id at 15%? Or should it still be possible to lower it even further, say from 15% to 10% and so on. This basically would mean you are able to switch between different versions of the buff. Can be coded perfectly fine, but the amount of work for the company is: <br />
a) some game designers/encounter designers have to meet, decide how this will look in detail, write this down<br />
b) someone has to physically create it (not only code, they need translatiopns for all the options in english, french, german, spanish, taiwanese, korean, russian, portugese...)<br />
c) compile the whole game from source code with these changes intact, they do this overnight usually, deploy to test server<br />
d) test this internally, and with every combination of reducing/switching off the buff (if untested, imagine there being a small bug that allows you to change the buff in your favor. Like being able to set it to 30% while everyone else still has only 15%), also test in all languages<br />
e) if a bug is found, you are at b again (fix bug, compile, deploy, test)<br />
f) when finished, go through all the pain of creating patches for all the different language versions, have en extended maintenance in several server centers worldwide, have customer support ready for an influx of questions/fake or unintentional bug reports about the new feature, everything that a patch release entails<br />
<br />
A lot of people have to do a lot of work for a feature of questionable use. And I am probably forgetting some steps.</div></div><hr />

Probably not and we had plenty of time in DS to do our best, its about time now for a little help for guilds like ours otherwise we would get to burnt out. We raid 3 times a week but often only 2 in DS and an achievement night so to speak to keep things fresh. <br />
Just remember there are a wide range of players who play this game, those want to burn content fast for progression, and those who want to progress steady. If you were the former you would have cleared or at least gotten close to by the time the 5% was released, and definatly by 10%. If you are the latter then I still cant understand why you are concerned by both 1)rankings and 2)clearing at your own pace. I can understand if you feel one of those and blizzard have given you the tool to do either, but I most definatly cant understand why you would care about both of them.</div></div><hr />

Working on them, like I said, we're working at our own pace. Only 4/8 heroic, so we're not stellar, but we practice and work at things until we can beat them.

I'll give ya that.

You will have had 4 weeks of opportunity total to down the last two bosses. If you spent 1 1/2 weeks to down Spine, that leaves you 2 1/2 weeks on Madness. You have time.

<br />
But I don't want to use the nerf! I want to compete in an un-nerfed area, if I don't clear the content, that's my mine or my guild's fault and we can work to better that. Heroics never meant to be for the masses and we're not children and can accept that.<br />
<br />
The Olympic anaolgy is good, it works toward what I'm thinking. However in a different way to you're wording it. Not all of us can compete in the Olympics, and that's fine! The people that can have to work exceptionally hard to get there, and it offers a chance for an incredibly prestigious award. How many people would care about the Olympics if everyone who wasn't good enough got a big enough buff/nerf until they were, ruining the point of it all?<br />
<br />
Whilst we're not there yet, we're pushing along to that point. It might not be the olympics that are being ruined now, but somewhere along the line of races, some of them are and it's not right.</div></div><hr />

Give the option to keep it at 5% rather than 10%, or when it finally gets to 30%, say allow you to change it to 10%. Allows more flexibility and would allow people who just finished the content at say try the 20% ability to slowly try out the content with more difficulty rather than getting smashed the next time through.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not every guild raid 16h a week, I raid 6, I am 5/8 HM and should be 6/8 but schedule problems are what they are.. this is equivalent for us to a 10% buff at the beginning of january for guilds that raid 16h/week in terms of hours raiding.<br />

What you and Blizzard both fail to realize is it is simply not a viable option for progression guilds. No guild concerned about downing bosses, rankings, and progression is going to turn of the buff when other guilds won't. Simple as that. It puts them at a disadvantage. Now I know you're probably thinking - well then don't complain, it's your own fault - but really it's not. Progression guilds are concerned about the race. When other guilds are using the nerf and you aren't, it makes your guild look worse than it actually is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I killed heroic Lich King in 25 man 2 weeks after 4.0 with the full buff and I was damned happy about it because we had been wiping for 2 months on that and one day we went there and one shot it. It was like only the US 255th kill only.<br />
<br />
We're only at 5% and there is way more kills of heroic Madness than that. So it makes me laugh when people say it's &quot;just like ICC&quot;.<br />
<br />
Personally I want the buffs, I just feel they are going too fast with those, but I guess the only reason is because MoP is coming a lot sooner than most think, otherwise there is absolutely no reason to make the content trivial so fast.</div></div><hr />

How unfeasible would it be for Blizzard to make the levels of the buff togglable? By that I mean, as it is now it is all or nothing, but whatif a guild was wiping on 5% the week before the 10% buff dropped. How difficult would it be to code in so that they could chose to keep it at 5%, instead of going for 10% or 0%VERY EASY to do. Just create a new aura, and a new dialog option and link the two. Personally I'd like that too. While my guild might need the 10% one, everything beyond 15% will probably make things boring :/</div></div><hr />

We've been making progress at about a boss a week (1/8H before nerf, 4/8H now), but we're starting to see a little bit of fatigue from our group.A little nerf will give us the pep we need to keep on truckin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whilst we're not there yet, we're pushing along to that point. It might not be the olympics that are being ruined now, but somewhere along the line of races, some of them are and it's not right.<br />
<br />
Thing is there are design issues with this raid that are rarely brought up by some of the most vocal complainers. Do you really want to &quot;progress&quot; on Spine by stacking enough of the right burst DPS classes while feeding them the appropriate gear, farming FL for Dragonwrath, and generally hoping you get those rare drop trinkets into the right hands? Blizzard's timing of the nerfs are directly linked with the fact that hardcore guilds blew through content fast because of legendary stacking, access to class stacking, and use/abuse (not bannable abuse but abuse nonetheless) of LFR farming for those trinkets and 4p bonuses. The tuning was such to handle such raid stacking (not necessarily class stacking) of gear and then the general concept issues with Spine tendons being so heavily restrictive to many classes.<br />
<br />
The Olympics comparison is meant to show that most of us are not at the level nor will we ever at the level to do some of this content at the hardest difficulty. Some say they enjoy this because it means whatever they get, they &quot;earned&quot; legit. The thing is for every piece of gear you acquire beyond what you have right now, you make the encounter easier. For particular fights, simply recruiting that class/spec that trivializes the fight makes things easier. The desire for keeping things at a static level of hard is actually misplaced because we naturally farm and build to make content easier. A 5% nerf is representative of those gear upgrades, notably the 4p bonuses and trinkets that are personal DPS increases of far more than 5% in some cases. <br />
<br />
I mean seriously, those few that got Heroic LK at 30% before Cataclysm launched weren't exactly &quot;meh&quot; when they finally got him. Even at 30%, there was quite a bit there that had to be accomplished and while it certainly allowed for a few (only a few) mistakes at 30%, those mistakes had to be minor ones and didn't save you from poor Val'kyr DPS, hitting Defile/Shadow Traps, or failing to deal with Soul Reaper effectively, among other things. <br />
<br />
The nerfs to DS really don't diminish your accomplishment all that much unless you were literally barely missing out on killing Ultraxion by 1% or less, or just barely missing that 3rd plate on Spine, and so on. But hey, that's nothing new in this game. My guild in TBC was pushing Kael'thas into his final phase and just barely missing out on a kill due to inconsistent weapon/council phase completion, then they nerfed his shield and weapon health and we pushed him over easily. Not exactly a new phenomena.</div></div><hr />

Here you go.. 271th US kill, 892 worldwide, server 3rd.. that is almost 1 year after ICC was released.<br />
<br />
I don't mind the buff, but I'm quite sure heroic Madness's 271th US kill won't be next November. And they started the ICC buff in March, so 4 months after release, not 2.

Or they didn't artificially gate Dragon Soul like they did ICC that prevented us from even seeing LK on Normal. I mean people complain about the timing but we weren't spending 4 weeks killing up to Hagara (but not her) either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't speak of good or bad players, cause personal skill is lost in a raid. You can be the best player possible, but if your raid partners fail you fail!<br />
<br />
This isn't Quake 3 duel, where everything depends on your skill and abilities, it's a gathering of people trying to kill bosses, and if the group isn't up-to-it, you can't change that, but to lower the difficulty for them. And who cares, as long as you can disable that buff if you so desire, personally, the faster the raid is over the better, cause all new raid instances that were introduced in Cataclysm became boring in like 5 lockouts in and my only desire now is to get gear and clear the instance ASAP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really, who cares; By the looks of it, we will have to watch this raid instance at least 4 more months, this alone is more tragic as if they would just sent full T13 heroic sets via in-game mail to everyone.</div></div><hr />

Well, just like medicine, things change. It used to require a degree to diagnose a headache. Now it only takes a few dollars and a trip to the pharmacy for some Advil. You were the cutting edge doctor, these are the prescribe at home casuals. Also, you got way more of the sense of accomplishment than anyone doing it post nerfs will acquire.

Effort = Stacked raid composition, good luck in LFR and natural raiding for 4p and trinket acquisition, continued runs of FL for Dragonwraths<br />
<br />
Sorry but unless you ran with the same gear set as those that killed it first or WORSE... you put in less effort than they did. Same with raid composition stacking or not, legendary stacking or not, and so on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly....I get a kick out of all the bads calling out the elitists whiners all the time (and I'm not an elitist and don't even raid for the record).<br />
<br />
TIME TO CALL A SPADE A SPADE<br />
<br />
What exactly is the rationale for the nerfs. It can't be the old &quot;see all the content&quot; BS because all the bads saw all the content in LFR.<br />
<br />
And it can't really be because you actually need the gear because most of the gear in DS will be redundant by lvl 87 in MoP and you won't need to be DS geared to level in MoP.<br />
<br />
There are only 2 possible reasons for the nerfs:<br />
<br />
1) they have to keep the bads occupied until the very delayed MoP comes out<br />
<br />
2) the bads are the real whiners here and Blizzard has caved into them yet again...its not the elitists wanting to be special snowflakes it's the bads demanding the right to flaunt the same gear as the hardcore while simultaneously demanding they get it for little or no effort.<br />
<br />
its the tyranny of the whining bads that leads to the nerfs and nothing else. And because Blizz always caves into the bads so they can strut around Org in their very own special snowflake gear the bads remain bad and never learn to be any better...it really is the worst aspects of the &quot;welfare&quot; state at play.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyvax</div><div class="date">2012-02-22, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem here is that these so-called hardcore folks, spend 20-30 hours a week bashing their head against heroics. They rarely have actual lives outside the game so the only sense of achievement in their lives are progressing through heroic mode raids. Once this sense of accomplishment gets endangered, they realize how worthless their lives actually are.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mukki</div><div class="date">2012-02-22, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, these nerfs are not for us. We've started raiding since like 3 weeks and doing 1 night raiding per week. We have progressed 6/8 by now, and we want the 2 remaining bosses still be a small challenge for our casual group. You don't get it, we are having fun while doing balanced encounters rather than having the content finished without any fun. So this is probably for those who have finished all heroic modes and just want to have easier time farming.<br />
<br />
There are millions of people dying every day overseas, people who don't know where their next meal is going to come from if it ever comes....and the most you can do is cry about how other people can do content that only you should be able to do?<br />

Considering only 1% of the subscribers killed heroic Madness, it's not a huge gamble to keep the raiding base happy by giving them a buff every month to keep them subscribed.

<br />
Yes, that is what you are saying.<br />
<br />
Do you not like the challenge? Then go do the freaking normal modes? Why do you want to complete the hardest setting in a game, and have it made easier for you? REALLY, WHY?<br />
<br />
For normal and LFR, I guess I could understand, but I still don't get it.<br />
<br />
Also, not killing Corruptions on Spine HC is going to be impossible now, guess we'll have to go with the tactic that kills it off entirely before you open the Tendons...<br />
<br />
Also, fun fact, these nerfs are heavier than ICC nerf. For example, when this nerf reaches 30%. Boss used to hit for 50% of your health. Then with this nerf, it will only hit for 35% of your health. ICC: It would still hit for 50/130 of your health, which is 38.5%.<br />

<br />
If you managed to reach any for of heroic progress, there is probably no brick wall for you. I can honestly say this. I know a lot of guilds, being a GM myself, and most guilds are stuck with A: lack of players, you're not gonna 9man stuff, or B: just still having stupid mistakes (every try someone manages to get hit by an icewave by accident, well, &quot;oops&quot;, or getting hit by doublecharges on blackmaster).<br />
<br />
Also, gear works as an effective self-nerf. Do you have any clue how SLOW it is to get gear in Dragon Soul? My guild has 6/8 HC on farm, and still have most guys at 399 ilvl. This rate at which you get gear is even slower than in Firelands. Conclusion: even if you have been hitting a brick wall on for example ultraxion, that same encounter is still getting easier and easier every single week, due to the new gear you get.<br />
<br />
I am still of the opinion that the nerfs are -Unnecesary for heroics, and -Way too early, due to most people still progressing at a decent rate, and still not in the best gear they can get.</div></div><hr />

When the first 5% nerf occured we were at 1/8, working on Hagara HM and killed her the first day of the nerf. We killed our 3rd Hboss last week and made a 2% Ultraxion try.

Wow, just wow. Not calling yourself elitist lol. &quot;If you haven't done 8/8 HC now, you are a baddy&quot; Nop, not elitist at all...<br />

<br />
The new mechanics on HC are new content. There is a large gap in difficulty between normal and heroic. 5% nerf does not just turn the hard heroic fight into a breeze overnight. yes by the time the nerf is at 20-30% a large amount of people will be able to complete it but that is fine since the content is about to be replaced anyways. It's sad that so many people against the nerfs have this attitude of &quot;It's not enough for me to win, others must fail&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, that is what you are saying.<br />
No what we're saying is if you're not pro enough to to beat encounters before they are nerfed, you are going to be stuck competing with all the other guilds struggling to down those same encounters, and you will no longer be competing with those that have beaten them. Oh wait that's what happens no matter what, nerfs or no nerfs. Those that are ahead, are still ahead, and you weren't competing with them anyway, especially those already done.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you not like the challenge? Then go do the freaking normal modes? Why do you want to complete the hardest setting in a game, and have it made easier for you? REALLY, WHY?<br />
<br />
For normal and LFR, I guess I could understand, but I still don't get it.<br />
I don't know, why do you improve your gear since all that does is make encounters easier? Don't you want a challenge? Don't you want to down content in the most difficult way possible in your pursuit for a real obstacle to overcome? Answer me that and you'll know partly why nerfs are inevitable.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, fun fact, these nerfs are heavier than ICC nerf. For example, when this nerf reaches 30%. Boss used to hit for 50% of your health. Then with this nerf, it will only hit for 35% of your health. ICC: It would still hit for 50/130 of your health, which is 38.5%.<br />
Assuming of course these nerfs actually reach 30% at all. All Blue posts indicate a big &quot;?&quot; as to how far these will go.<br />

If you managed to reach any for of heroic progress, there is probably no brick wall for you. I can honestly say this.

Tell me this, which would you rather have as your next item as a Rogue: Heroic Vial of Shadows or Heroic Shadow Wing Armbands? Perhaps I'm being unfair... Heroic Vial of Shadows vs Heroic Tier Chest? Still not fair? Hmmm... how about Heroic Vial of Shadows vs TWO Heroic leather pieces? Oh still no?<br />
<br />
The point being that items like Vial of Shadows constitute such a huge jump in DPS that you could completely forego upgrading your tier from Normal to Heroic and just get a Vial and get more DPS. That one item is 6-8% of a person's DPS pulling top WoL parses, at least with Feral logs that I've observed, and that's huge. <br />
<br />
The thing is, my guild currently has gotten very very poor luck with those trinkets, and it shows. We also lack many of the best burst classes for Spine, and it shows. We have Dragonwraths... but unfortunately they are in the hands of folks like Warlocks and not Mages (nor do we have 4 Mages to pull in for insane burst damage).<br />
<br />
The nerfs compensate for the imbalanced loot distribution that RNG can perpetuate week after week of an otherwise healthy and progressing guild. &quot;Sorry guys we all got upgrades but that only amounted to a 4% increase in RDPS... still short... so who wants in for the first four next week that still needs loot?&quot; It has gotten to the point in my guild where people say &quot;Oh I only need shared loot from this guy&quot; and we shard 50%+ of our Heroic drops, all the way through to Warmaster. Until we get lucky... well... yeah. Sucks to be us til 10% I guess.</div></div><hr />

&quot;We almost killed spine with 5%, now this 10% buff is going to make it easy mode and other guilds are going to get it&quot;, waaaa, waaaa. Guess what, if you aren't a top 100 guild, you're just like the other 99.99%+ of the population.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game is very hard when it comes to pugging. It's also unreasonable to run all the alts in a guild run also so this debuff is much needed in my case where I have to run 3 random PuG DS a week plus 1 with my main as a guild (should help our heroic progress too).<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are a lot of people who don't need to run LFR and this will help out on a lot of PUGs. <br />

You mean they released two tiers of undertuned mechanics, then created a third tier with overtuned mechanics necessitating very specific specs (contrary to their mantra of no cookie-cutters here brah)... which then got promptly nerfed?

If you aren't 8/8 heroic you need these nerfs, the only thing I question is blizz's choice to do this.. it'll keep people playing for a little more but overall will shorten the time people will play because they'll clear content more quickly.

And yet, there are many people that haven't hit a wall yet and want to continue to progress, and this nerf is a kick in the face. At least it feels like one. I know if I hadn't killed madness before the 5% nerf it would have been very disheartening to me.</div></div><hr />

For those that do it's an approximate 5% change, which is pretty minor, and we expect it to be about a month before we raise it another 5%. This first change will absolutely help the guilds that are just barely scraping by, or just need a tiny bump to cross the next hurdle, but it's just not logical to exclaim that someone will roll into Raid Finder, grab a couple items, then be looting Heroic Deathwing's corpse the next night.<br />
<br />
taken straight from a blue post when the nerf was first announced <br />
<br />
i would say it was pretty clear that it would be given monthly... sure they said they would monitor progress but also look at the graphs front page.. <br />
<br />
the last two statements before the graph explain it pretty damn well<br />
<br />
We don't see the same effect for the number of new Heroic and Normal Deathwing kills. Using Destroyer's End as our method of measurement, we see only a small spike, not even passing the number of new kills that were earned during the week of December 6.<br />
<br />
The 5% decrease in difficulty made a much bigger impact to players that were stuck on a Heroic boss than it did for those who were stuck on a normal boss. <br />
<br />
this shows pretty definitively that it really the 5% buff didnt make a huge impact ... people who werent clearing HC mode before still arent<br />
<br />
it helped get people over a bump but the difference by week in heroic deathwing kills hasnt jumped as a result from the nerf ... its still on a similar pace... especially when you look at people just getting destroyers end title ... that is pretty much linear too ... not a huge increase as a result of the nerf. <br />
<br />
TLDR: the 5% nerf obviously didnt have enough impact as they expected. they said it would likely be a month ... its been a month .. stop bitching</div></div><hr />

why are you trying to make up stuff? no one lures you onto the dark path of +10% buffs or something. you chose for yourself (and your friends) if you want to kill stuff like it was intended for the hardcore of the hardcore, or you chose to accept you are NOT that hardcore and accept the help offered. but it's really your choice. don't act as if something was taken away from you.<br />

You wrote the word &quot;work&quot; several times in your post, this is a videogame, i cannot believe we still have MMO players who believe otherwise. Everquest really had a profound effect on so many of you, even the ones who never played that game. If people within the game community does not care about your and my achievements then who does care? There is no other gaming community out there, not even the 12 year old Xbox Live crowd that eats CoD and Halo for breakfast that is as silly as the WoW community is, even those &quot;KIIIDZZ&quot; dont care what someone else does or how they play their game, yet WoW players are down right obsessed what some other guy, on another server does, who he kills and what he wears. Ive seen types like this, and it seems that a mental block is a problem here, you only feel accomplished if *YOU* and nobody else (or very few) do it. Its not even about challanges its about stroking that epeen and standing around Stormwind/Orgrimmar in hopes that someone will notice how much time you wasted. This will fall on deaf ears, because people will talk about &quot;game design man!&quot; and how things should be. Blizzard listened to your kind, and lost 2 million subs with Cata, they learned their lesson the hard way.</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt be so sure if people like me realy minority...i would guess its more 50-50 and this is in my opinion one of the reasons why more and more people quit.<br />
<br />
The game doesnt have much challenges left. You log on wednesday, play tol barad, get arena points, goes lfr MAYBE if you realy can handle the darkside of humanity, ok 3 hours passed done for the week(i spread that over 2 evenings). Yeah lets raid the ONLY PVE challenge the game offers and now nope no challenge left.<br />
<br />
Even if youre right and im the minority, people like you can do lfr as much as you want. You can get your little epics(wich have no worth at all, the worth lies in the way of getting it not in the itemlevel) and see all the content. I think its a great solution for people like you. Thats the reason it got implemented.<br />

So this is probably for those who have finished all heroic modes and just want to have easier time farming.<br />

Was refuting a post made by another poster that TRION Worlds (aka RIFT) had non-nerfed content and well balanced PvE, which is what my comments were directed at. I loved T11/T12 in WoW, with T12 being the weaker of the two in terms of good balancing. T11 was IMHO the best tier to date.<br />

Apparently it was necessary.<br />
I have feeling they review it once per month and if they feel they need to raise the debuff. If in March they feel enough people down Madness, they'll not raise it for April. But if the numbers stagnate to much in April, they'll raise it again for May.<br />

I just fail to see the reason to nerf normal and hard modes.<br />
<br />
LFR is primarily there for the same reason LFG exists, for people to participate in group activities without having to have a premade group to participate with. Bear in mind this has nothing to do with difficulty tuning on Normal/Heroic, which is the fallacy often made in these threads.<br />
<br />
Re-tuning Normal/Heroic is entirely different.<br />
<br />
A) They've always nerfed content to open it up a bit more, make the hard stuff slightly less hard so more people give it a shot. It isn't just to see it, it is to entice you to complete it or keep attempting to complete it.<br />
<br />
B) Some nerfs just need to happen for a smoother difficulty curve. See Yor'sahj and Spine nerfs. These are for problems that arise in basic mechanics or stop-gaps that shouldn't exist or whatever. Most people (most) don't have issues with these nerfs and balance changes.<br />
<br />
C) As previously stated, there is a unique gearing problem this tier involving Dragonwrath, 4pT13, and shared boss loot trinkets. These items constitute exceptional gains in limited slots, surpassing even several higher ilvl upgrades in other slots combined. Some raids are lucky enough to get a good spread of these things, others (like my own) have good tier bonuses but next to no trinkets, even LFR ones. The nerfs have come sooner rather than later because of this problem and the fact that in 2 more months, my guild could STILL be waiting on its first Heroic Cunning/Fetish and only be rocking a single Heroic Vial (assuming we keep that individual).</div></div><hr />

These items constitute exceptional gains in limited slots, surpassing even several higher ilvl upgrades in other slots combined. Some raids are lucky enough to get a good spread of these things, others (like my own) have good tier bonuses but next to no trinkets, even LFR ones. The nerfs have come sooner rather than later because of this problem and the fact that in 2 more months, my guild could STILL be waiting on its first Heroic Cunning/Fetish and only be rocking a single Heroic Vial (assuming we keep that individual).<br />
<br />
A) There is a difference at adjusting encounter a bit and throwing a 5,10,20,25,35% debuff on all mobs...<br />
<br />
B) see A<br />
<br />
C) You dont realy want to tell me now that you have to slot legendary casters and rogues to beat spine on normal mode? 4T Bonus is more then enough for any class to manage the fight.And Heroic, yeah its there for a challenge. You can gear up easily. Even our small non progress guild took 4 bosses on the first DS run without debuff. It wasnt that hard to begin with and its the last raid of the expansion and its the easiest by far even without buff.</div></div><hr />

Did you really have to make an account to say something as silly as that?<br />
<br />
The differences between the two forms of nerfs are exceptionally negligible at 5% and 10%, so why this is even being argued is beyond me. Yes DS is a true 5% nerf whereas the ICC 5% buff was slightly less than that in terms of needed output before and after to meet minimums, but honestly in terms of reality, player performance, RNG, and the like, the difference is almost utterly swallowed in the noise and not worth discussing.</div></div><hr />

I didnt cleared it because i just dont have the time to raid every week. But does that mean i want to get an easy kill on the bosses? <br />
<br />
No i dont...for me its a fun killer. When i have a tough time with a Boss (no matter were) and have being whiping a lot and then finally kill it, im happy because i know we did better then before. We suceeded because we &quot;worked&quot; for it. But if im whiping on a boss a lot and then comes a 5 or 10% or later even 35% nerf then i dont feel any kind of satisfaction because I kow its was not that we got better, not because we worked for it, it was because Blizz decided that we should have an easy kill. <br />
<br />
Dont tell me you can turn it off...no one will turn it off well guess what, im not the only person in my 10 man raid. Or can i choose just for me to turn it off? You allways have a few in your group who just wants some easy and fast kills. Disabling is just no option even if you have a way to do so. Whoever is saying so must be playing a different game...<br />

Stop whining and find a guild or start a guild that believe the same way you do. If you can't then just continue to be forever alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lots of folks have &quot;worked their asses off&quot; to kill bosses this tier, but not everyone was lucky enough to have the right comps or the right gear drops to make that same &quot;work&quot; result in the same kill. Your righteous indignation is sorely misplaced since the pass/fail of many guilds (certainly not all pushing Heroics) was out of their hands and at the whim of RNG shared boss loot and how many Dragonwraths they brought with them from Firelands. If Guild A with a melee stacked, non-trinket geared raid kills a boss at 5% that you killed at 0% simply because they are melee stacked and lack trinkets, that doesn't cheapen their kill or your own, that's just Blizzard giving them the same boost you happened to get through loot. Get over it.<br />
<br />
Oh and it is a video game. You haven't worked your ass off at all, you've sat in a chair in front of a computer screen for several hours mashing the same 5-6 keys over and over until the raid figured out how to deal with P2 Zon'ozz tentacles efficiently, not die to Hagara's frost phase, not screw up Fading Twilight or Hour of Twilight, not get hit by charge and soak properly, etc etc.</div></div><hr />

Here you go.. 271th US kill, 892 worldwide, server 3rd.. that is almost 1 year after ICC was released.<br />
<br />
I don't mind the buff, but I'm quite sure heroic Madness's 271th US kill won't be next November. And they started the ICC buff in March, so 4 months after release, not 2. Like I said above, only explanation I can see is we'll have big announcement for MoP very soon, otherwise there is no reason to make us breeze through content that fast.<br />
<br />
So - after 12 months, new (OP) talents, and a 30% nerf, there were 892 kills of LK.<br />
<br />
In just 2 months, and 5% we already have 526 Madness kills.<br />
<br />
This is why people are getting their backs up.<br />
<br />
Madness is the end boss of this expansion and Blizzard are nerfing it so hard that by the time MoP is out, he'll actually have a lower DPS / HPS requirement than pre-nerf normal mode.<br />
<br />
Every time they turn that nerf up, the Heroic Mode &quot;reward&quot; mount, is getting 1 step closer to the Blizzard Store mounts.<br />
<br />

You have your personal view of a serious raider that some posters claim to not share, and that is your view of a serious raider is that of someone that does anything and everything in their power to down a boss because not doing so is simply gimping yourself.<br />
<br />
Those that claim the challenge is what they really and truly want DO in fact have that option. Thing is people don't actually believe in this as wholeheartedly as they claim nor can they ever produce a group of people that are likeminded such that they progress in DS without using the handicap. Just because people don't take the choice seriously doesn't mean the choice doesn't exist.<br />

<br />
Well you can just not gem/enchant/use food/flask and all those other things. Those are options that you can choose too or not too partake in. Now lets look at Blizzard like a company,which it is. That company has a product(WOW). They made the product for all the consumers (players) or most too enjoy. What good is a product to a company that only some consumers get full usage out of it. That company will lose business or wont be able to expand because their product is too difficult to get the maximum use of the money they spend on it. Well the company has two options:<br />
1. Let the stragling consumers fall off and not pay anymore, which could lead to the company going under.<br />
2. Try to please the majority of its consumers by making their product easier to get the max usage out of it. And at the same time keep a more difficult option available for those who want it.<br />
I dont know about you but I love money and happy people so im going to go with option 2. If you recall when Blizz did this option with leveling they saw a huge raise in numbers. Gotta realize its a business first and a game second.</div></div><hr />

It's called &quot;Heroic&quot; mode. There is nothing &quot;Heroic&quot; about turning up and winning<br />
<br />
And people are getting their backs up for no good reason. You cannot compare timelines in ICC and DS at all. In the first 2 months, we hadn't even seen Lich King Normal yet due to gated content remember? If you were lucky enough to kill Normal Lich King without running out of attempts the first week he was available, that meant you had been clearing from Dec 8th up to the end of February/beginning of March. That means Heroics didn't even START until 3 months into the tier.<br />
<br />
Couple that with LK being tremendously harder than anything else in the tier and yes you only had 859 Heroic LK (25) kills after 9 months of 25man Heroic Raiding, but about 5x that many were sitting at LK not even bothering anymore content with 11/12H. Most guilds didn't even push him while he was 10%-25% knowing that 30% was coming soon, guilds that likely could have gotten him in the 15%-25% range. <br />
<br />
And the appropriate number of Madness kills for this comparison is 204 after 2.5 months of Heroic 25man Raiding. <br />
<br />
Try again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard wants us to burn through content faster --&gt; They do not excpect us to play DS for that many months more --&gt; If they do not expect us to not get bored, it means they acknowledge the fact that DS won't last long --&gt; They are prepared to release content SOON (TM) _-_-&gt; WHICH MEANS either a filler-raid for Cataclysm (unlikely, as they have already stated this will be the last patch of the expansion, minus pre-MoP one) OR they are ready to begin Beta stage of MoP a few weeks to a month after march press event.<br />
<br />
Either way, this is Blizzard's way of telling us Dragon Soul won't be forever. They have also said that this buff won't ever reach the numbers of ICC (like 50% lol). Can't post links yet, but the blue posts are there, trust me.</div></div><hr />

Those with 8/8HC clears don't give a fuck about the nerfs. Content has been cleared, achievement received, they don't really care who come's after them in rankings. <br />
Those who QQ about the nerfs and with lower progress had a lot of time to do it. They played bad or slow, they were unable to learn to play better but they QQ about a little bit of help. What do you expect? Blizzard to sit and wait for you 1 year until you learn to play? <br />
<br />
Me and my guild were 4/8 HC before 1st nerf. We were stuck on Zon'zozz, wiping somewhere between 5 and 10% hp, on boss enrage. The 1st nerf was enough to help us down the tentacles faster, and kill the boss before enrage (and now, after getting more used to the movement and everyone playing better, we do have a comfortable margin). Then we reached Warmaster and the 5% were a good aid for us since we have a bad comp for it (3 melee, 3 ranged). It helps us in P1 and it's still on the edge. Now we are going into Spine. First attempt without any optimizations for burst dps were crappy. We do have this week to measure ourselves against the tendon with only 5% and gear/playstyle optimization. Maybe we would have enjoyed 1 more week before another nerf, but hey, next week is fine too. No qq.

How about those &quot;normal&quot; player; ie: those between hardcore and casual?<br />
<br />
Lets hope we can get a filler raid between 30% and MoP, like Halion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it will help a lot for the people that know the tactics but are being blocked by the heavy raid damage blocks to properly get a feel of the phases after all the buff lowers health but also damage done by the mobs. A lot of bosses in DS are pretty much healer intensive in certain phases and everything depends on that.<br />
<br />
take Zon'ozz or Yor'sahj and even ultra. <br />
<br />
with Zon'ozz you have the black phase it deals a lot of raid damage and you need to get the adds down fast. That lower raid damage might safe guilds that where barely managed to keep the people up in to a stage that its now possible for them to actually start learning the phase to do it properly instead of the guild being one shotted.<br />
<br />
Yor'sahj has the ooze phases that nine times out of ten deal a shitton raid wise damage.<br />
<br />
ultra last 10/20% becomes healer intensive too.<br />
<br />
We never had troubles with Berserk at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
take our own guild for example <br />
before the 5% nerf we had 3/8 hc (morchoc and haggy and (Yor'sahj the night before reset) With Yor'sahj before the buff we had a rough time people keeping up and sometimes we had trouble killing some blobs in time. For the heavy raid damage phases we had to rely basically on a string of raid walls if we messed one up people started dying left and right. After the buff the healers did notice a little less strain on those phases and the blob killing improved a lot to instead of having some close calls with them we now killed them halfway. We dint even seriously tried Zon'ozz before the buff because our guild pretty much died during the black phase. After the buff we were actually able to progress and learn from the black phase since healers a slight better way in keeping people up. Was Zon'ozz easy mode at that point hell no we still needed to be on the ball but at least we where able to learn the phase now. instead of the group dying 5-10 seconds in to the phase.<br />
<br />
After the buff we managed ultra and Zon'ozz. Purely again because of the healer strain in those fights. Hagara became a push over. and Yor'sahj slightly easier.<br />
<br />
So yea with this new buff I do expect a serious improvement on warmaster (this is the one were working on right now) and perhaps even some spine tries.<br />
<br />
And ultra and Zon'ozz become more smoother kills then they are now, With with Hagara turning morchock mode and Yor'sahj becoming the new hagara pre nerf.<br />
<br />
So yes I am quite convinced that the buff can help a lot of guilds.</div></div><hr />

Because after working on it for over a week on ~3-6%, it would be stupid to just zerg it down with another buff, removing any of the 'YESSSSSS' factor the kill would have.I don't mind nerfs, but i would appreciate them coming in slower, or being able to toggle the % you want. The 5% nerf brought Ultraxion and Zonozz hc to our level, so we need that. We do NOT need another 5% to trivialize the last few % that are currently our only challenge with those fights....I'm certain we could kill both Ultraxion and Warmaster on the 5% buff, I'm also certain we can't kill it without the buff and we will have a far easiertime doing it on the 10% buff. GG blizz for ruining a perfectly tuned challenge for us :(</div></div><hr />

You can choose to leave the debuff on or turn it off. If you're looking for the challenge that doing the raid gives you without the debuff and your raid group isn't interested in turning off the debuff, that is still a choice that is being made. No one is forcing that on anyone. If you personally feel forced, then it may be an option to find another group that is interested in the challenge of doing it without the debuff. <br />
<br />
It's official people. They don't give a shit about guilds or hardcore players. Or they are just that stupid.<br />
<br />
Because it is so simple to just find another group. It's not LFR, idiot.<br />
<br />
<br />
We understand that there are players out there who do what they do for recognition and--dare I say it?--glory. Since we'll likely continue to use a model where we introduce a raid, then slowly remove roadblocks over time, there's a possibility that we could do something akin to adding a feat of strength for players who defeat an encounter in a non-debuffed incarnation, or possibly time-stamps on the armory raid progression section. At the very least, there are options on the table for the future. These aren't things we'll be able to do for Dragon Soul though<br />
<br />
I guess a title is too much to ask for. Better give something, like a time-stamp, no one cares about otherwise people get jeaulous...<br />
Do they also think top athletes do what they do just for the challenge and don't need rewards? Or do they just want to kill off any hardcore aspect of this game?<br />
<br />
See how many people killed LK HC without buff...</div></div><hr />

My quip with blizzard is what little faith they have in the vast majority of the player base. <br />

Quote: 'We're not &quot;nerfing blindly.&quot; Keep in mind that, the debuff can be disabled. So if you and your Raid choose to do so, you can take on the encounter without it.' <br />
I think they are really missing the point.. purposely. At this stage alot of guilds are just trying to get even a high server rank or such. Can you see any guild doing DS hrc 10/25 without the buff now that its available over aother guilds on the server who are around the same level as them. The whole 'bragging' rights line they use is void... that is no longer or merit in this game. For top level guilds winning is winning.. your either first or your not. For other guilds it may be down to server rankings as I said already. <br />
<br />
Quote: 'Meanwhile, the debuff affords those that want to progress a bit, who have experienced difficulty, more of a leg-up.' <br />
Ahhh isn't that the point of LFR and even normal mode to a point. EVERYONE is getting to see raid content which was the big thing blizzard were always worried about and the reasoning behind past nerfs etc which now come at an alarming rate. <br />
<br />
Quote:'When a group is really close to taking down a boss, but just can't seem to manage it, a bump like this is sometimes enough to see them on to the next challenge. ' And what about the people who want to get it down based on they're own skill and effort and now have to contend with maybe an officer/gm of a guild saying they want to get past this boss NOW.. this just instills the lets wait for the nerf and then clear it. If you can clear lfr/normal then that should be enough.. hrc modes will end being about as difficult as normal mode. <br />
<br />
QUOTE: 'It's fine to disagree with us on this, but please make sure that you continue to do so in a constructive manner and refrain from starting flame wars or posting harassing/defamatory language toward posters in the thread.' <br />
Which is basically saying, we will lock any thread disputing our statements because there's no way in hell a wow forum thread will last more than 2 pages with out people flaming each other. Using the 'flaming' excuse to lock what maybe a fairly constructive thread instead of just deleting the nab posts and giving the individual posters a temp ban or whatever... nah couldnt be doing that. <br />

Saying you can just turn off the buff is like saying you can just not gem and enchant your gear, or refuse to use warcraft food and flasks. No serious raider is ever going to do any of these things, because people like to feel like they're doing everything in their power to fight against impossible odds. <br />
<br />
If 'just turning it off' is such a real option, why don't they just do it from day one? Why do exactly zero groups do this with the buff off? This isn't anything but a dangling carrot that blizzard periodically lowers when they think the hamsters are giving up on the treadmill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because even the most hardcore elitists appreciate the buff. <br />
They just like to whine on forums against this debuff on bosses to make themselves look hardcore, but in the end they use it just like everyone else. <br />
<br />
The current difficulty of heroic bosses is different from what it was in the past, instead of requiring to adopt perfectly to fight dynamics you now have to stack certain classes or certain specs to accomplish something, even if you have the &quot;bestest&quot; players in the world. There were fights where certain classes/specs did better but they were no way that mandatory, this whole expansion it's just a game who can field more druid, mages, shamans etc... <br />
<br />
Majority of guilds don't have the luxury of swapping classes in and out like the encounter demands, that's why Blizzard is trying to balance it out for the rest of the population who doesn't raid 7 days per week and for guilds who don't have a waiting line front of their recruitment office. <br />
<br />
The only real downside of this nerf/debuff is that the raid will slowly but surely require less healers to a point where most healers will be benched in favor of additional DPS just to plow through the content even faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was my exact thought when I read that blue post - just find another group, hunh? So, aside from heroic lockouts, I just jump into trade and pick up a pug to clear this with? I guess I've been doing it all wrong these years applying to a guild, building up a raid spot and working as a team to get these kills. <br />
<br />
However I do have to say, to the people complaining about the nerf and no challenge, I either call BS or you're not challenging yourself to do it on 25man. There are not that many people that have cleared heroic mode as claim on these forums. I'm on the number 9 ranked server T13-25 worldwide, #19 overall and there are only 2 guilds that are 8/8 - that's 50 ppl give or take that have killed heroic madness. We're a top 5 guild and are our teams are 2/8 and 3/8 each, so no, there is nothing wrong with a nerf at this time to help the rest of us along. If you think there is, you're doing it wrong, not the other way around. I'm guessing either your actually one of the very few ultra hardcore that actually killed him on 25m and kudos to you or you just watched the youtube video and thought you did.</div></div><hr />

MMO Champ JUST published a blog about how effective the 5% nerf was. As the graph indicates, progress is continuing at a healthy, linear rate. It hasn't leveled off. Why are you nerfing heroic mode, again? You explicitly told us that you would not continue with blind nerfs on auto pilot.<br />
We're not &quot;nerfing blindly.&quot; Keep in mind that, the debuff can be disabled. So if you and your Raid choose to do so, you can take on the encounter without it. We also explained our thought processes in the original announcement blog about the debuff here (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/4326384/Dragon_Soul_Difficulty_Changes-1_18_2012).<br />
<br />
Despite arguments to the contrary, there is a choice involved here. You can choose to leave the debuff on or turn it off. If you're looking for the challenge that doing the raid gives you without the debuff and your raid group isn't interested in turning off the debuff, that is still a choice that is being made. No one is forcing that on anyone. If you personally feel forced, then it may be an option to find another group that is interested in the challenge of doing it without the debuff.<br />
<br />
Is this really Blizzard's response? If we want a challenge, yet your raid doesn't want the buff turned off because they want easy loot... they simply say we need to look for other raids? Okay Blizzard, give me those raids. You owe me tons of things anyway</div></div><hr />

If your guild TRULY cares about the challenge you will turn off the buff. The argument &quot;It because the easier mode is there we choose to do it.&quot; doesn't fly. Why not do LFR then? Not to mention people who really wanna challenge themselves increase the difficulty on their own. Like the Ironman Challenge. Or playing through Megaman without taking any damage. Completing hell mode in Cave Story without getting any life capsules and using only the polar star. Those people truly care for the challenge. If you don't wanna turn the buff off and complain about it, you in fact don't really care (or a majority of your guild doesn't).</div></div><hr />
