<br />
Read the previous Blue Post. They said they are working on better solution IE rework of AH, but in the mean time, before they actually finish the rework, they have this temporary solution so that we can actually use the AH before they fix it properly.<br />

Yes it was. Either the hotfix notes are wrong or someone’s plan changed.<br />
<br />

This is a welcome change. It was awkward having to jump off the boat just to log out.</div></div><hr />

I think people who flood the AH with single stacks will start to notice it when they lose what they are asking every 5 herbs or whatever that don't sell. I don't know the current price but, if they are about 50g a herb, you're losing 50g every 5 herbs. If you have 1500 herbs (see it often in trade) that's what, 15k you're losing overall? Assuming none sell obviously. <br />
<br />
Over a decent period of time it can add up especially when lots of people are undercutting, and those people re-list their auctions to undercut again.<br />
<br />
Of course a real solution would be better but it's a start. Pretty sure the problem is that they changed the amount of api pulls or something at the start of Legion though which is when all this started, the AH was made awful, armoury was taken down etc to ease server lag.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it certainly is and can't wait for the waves of QQ from those who do this as it can get very annoying was watching one video of someone scanning the AH for one item and took them 30 minutes to do so..</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's 2018. Market/AH tech shouldn't be this bad just because it's getting a bit flooded.<br />
<br />
Or better yet do what GW2 does with it's Market system.</div></div><hr />

People are purposefully posting singles with lower prices to attempt to drive down the value and take advantage of people who automatically undercut with Auctionator (or something else) and don't pay attention. I don't think this is going to cause these people to lose any money because eventually someone likely will buy out their single.<br />
<br />
To me this seems like a pointless solution. They should have changed it so that for trade goods that stack up to 200, that you can't post less than maybe 10 or 20 at a time. Some have made the argument &quot;what if I only want to buy 1&quot;... really? How often does that occur? Not often and you can still just buy the 10 or you can trade with someone for a single.</div></div><hr />

They should have changed the AH in a way you only post one stack of X and the buyer is allowed to choose the quantity they want to buy from that stack.</div></div><hr />

It deployed to PTR late last night. Will go live with restarts only on Live. So thats not false.<br />

They are working on improving the AH as a whole, but in the meantime any work-arounds to reduce the single-stack herbs/ores is very welcome while we wait for the new AH.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah for sure the change is welcome.<br />

But they need to take a nuke to it's current design and either go the GW2 route or something different.</div></div><hr />
