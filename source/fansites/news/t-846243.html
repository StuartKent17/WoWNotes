<br />

Crimson Scourge (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/81137/crimson-scourge/) has been redesigned slightly. Instead of a 50/100% chance to make the next Blood Boil (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48721/blood-boil/) free when Plague Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/45462/plague-strike/) is used on a target with Blood Plague (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59879/blood-plague/), the talent now gives a 5/10% chance to provide a free Blood Boil when the death knight lands any melee attack on a Blood Plagued target.<br />
If Death Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49998/death-strike/) is used while a Blood Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77513/blood-shield/) is already active, the new absorb will stack with the old one instead of replacing it.<br />

Scarlet Fever (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/81132/scarlet-fever/) now applies via Blood Plague (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59879/blood-plague/), rather than Blood Boil (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48721/blood-boil/).<br />
Will of the Necropolis (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/81164/will-of-the-necropolis/) no longer refunds a Blood Rune when it resets Rune Tap’s (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48982/rune-tap/) cooldown. Instead it makes the next Rune Tap free while Will of the Necropolis is active.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost<br />
<br />
Chilblains (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/50043/chilblains/) now also causes Chains of Ice (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/45524/chains-of-ice/) to root the target for 1.5/3 seconds.<br />

Dark Transformation (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/63560/dark-transformation/) now increases pet damage by 80%, down from 100%.<br />
Death’s Advance (new talent): While both Unholy Runes are depleted, movement-impairing effects cannot reduce the death knight below 75/100% of normal movement speed.<br />
Desecration (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/55667/desecration/) is now also triggered by Necrotic Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73975/necrotic-strike/).<br />
The ratio of runic power return from Magic Suppression (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49611/magic-suppression/) has been reduced by roughly one third.<br />
Rage of Rivendare (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/50121/rage-of-rivendare/) now increases strike damage by 12/24/36%, down from 15/30/45%.<br />
Runic Corruption (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/51462/runic-corruption/) procs while the aura is already active now add 3 seconds to the existing aura duration, instead of simply refreshing/overwriting the existing aura.<br />
Shadow Infusion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49572/shadow-infusion/) now increases pet damage by 8% per stack, down from 10%.<br />
Sudden Doom (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49530/sudden-doom/) is now triggered only from main-hand auto attacks, and is normalized according to weapon speed rather than having a fixed percentage chance.<br />
Unholy Might (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/91107/unholy-might/) (passive) has been reduced to a 5% Strength increase, down from 10%.<br />
Virulence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49568/virulence/) has been redesigned. It now grants 10/20/30% additional disease damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Glyphs<br />
<br />
Glyph of Dark Succor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96284/glyph-of-dark-succor/) (new glyph) raises the minimum healing done by Death Strike from 7% to 15% of maximum health, but only while in Unholy (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48265/unholy-presence/) or Frost Presence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48266/frost-presence/).<br />
Glyph of Death’s Embrace (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/57215/glyph-of-deaths-embrace/) no longer refunds Runic Power when self-healing via Lichborne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49039/lichborne/).<br />
<br />
<br />
Runeforging<br />
<br />
Swordbreaking (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/54446/rune-of-swordbreaking/) and Swordshattering (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53323/rune-of-swordshattering/) now reduce disarm duration by 60%, up from 50%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Death Knight Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
Blood of the North (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/54638/blood-of-the-north/) is no longer incorrectly increasing Blood Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/45902/blood-strike/) damage by 10%.<br />
The tooltip for Blood Presence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48263/blood-presence/) was giving an incorrect value and has been corrected.<br />
The amount of bonus damage Blood Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/45902/blood-strike/) was receiving per disease was inconsistent with its tooltip and has been amended.<br />
Crimson Scourge (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/81137/crimson-scourge/) will no longer proc if Blood Plague (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/59879/blood-plague/) is not present on the target.<br />
Death Grip (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49576/death-grip/) has a minimum range requirement of 8 yards against players, but this was not stated in the tooltip. The tooltip has been updated.<br />
Desecration (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/55667/desecration/) should stay in place while on the Alliance Gunship in Deepholm.<br />

Mage Bug Fixes<br />

Arcane Power (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/12042/arcane-power/) now has its tooltip updated when Glyph of Arcane Power (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/56972/glyph-of-arcane-power/) is active.<br />
The attachment point of Cone of Cold (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/120/cone-of-cold/) was too far left and has been adjusted on male troll models.<br />
Evocation (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/12051/evocation/) was returning less mana than the tooltip stated it should. This has been corrected.<br />
Flame Orb's (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82739/flame-orb/) tooltip should now state how much damage it will explode for after the Fire Power (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/54734/fire-power/) talent is chosen.<br />

Nether Vortex (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86209/nether-vortex/) was causing Arcane Blast (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/30451/arcane-blast/) to yield a string error when Arcane Blast was reflected. It shouldn't do that.<br />
When Presence of Mind (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/12043/presence-of-mind/) was active, Conjure Mana Gem (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/759/conjure-mana-gem/) was not becoming an instant cast spell if used to refresh a stack of 2 or less Mana Gems. This has been fixed.<br />
Presence of Mind (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/12043/presence-of-mind/) is no longer consumed when Flame Orb's (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82739/flame-orb/) is cast.<br />
Ring of Frost (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82691/ring-of-frost/) can now be cast and works properly on transports (this includes elevators, trapdoors, etc.).<br />

The mana costs of Blessing of Might (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/19740/blessing-of-might/) and Blessing of Kings (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/20217/blessing-of-kings/) have been increased by approximately 217%, making them roughly equal to the cost of Mark of the Wild (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/39233/mark-of-the-wild/).<br />
Crusader Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/35395/crusader-strike/) weapon damage percent has been increased to 135%, up from 115%.<br />
Divine Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82326/divine-light/) mana cost has been increased by approximately 10%.<br />
Divine Plea (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/54428/divine-plea/) now lasts for 9 seconds, down from 15. It grants 4% mana per tick, instead of 2%, for a total of 12% mana, up from 10%.<br />
Flash of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/68008/flash-of-light/) mana cost has been increased by approximately 10%.<br />
Forbearance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/25771/forbearance/)<br />
<br />
The duration has been lowered to 1 minute, down from 2.<br />
Lay on Hands (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/633/lay-on-hands/) now causes Forbearance on the target. It used to only cause it when cast on the paladin. This was an old design from when Divine Protection (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/498/divine-protection/) caused Forbearance and the paladin didn’t want to prevent a tank from using their defensive cooldown. <br />
Lay on Hands (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/633/lay-on-hands/) cannot be a critical effect and will not be affected by most abilities which modify healing (such as Beacon of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53652/beacon-of-light/)). In addition, Lay on Hands is no longer on the global cooldown.<br />
Since only Divine Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/642/divine-shield/), Lay on Hands (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/633/lay-on-hands/) and Hand of Protection (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/1022/hand-of-protection/) cause Forbearance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/25771/forbearance/), the tooltips have been adjusted to better explain the mechanic.<br />
<br />
Holy Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/635/holy-light/) mana cost has been increased by approximately 10%.<br />
Holy Wrath (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/2812/holy-wrath/) no longer counts nearby critters when dividing damage among its targets.<br />
Inquisition (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/84963/inquisition/) is no longer dispellable.<br />
Rebuke (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96231/rebuke/) can now be trained by all paladins at level 54. Existing characters will need to visit their trainer, even if they had talented Rebuke before.<br />

Vindication (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/9452/vindication/) no longer allows Hammer of Justice (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/853/hammer-of-justice/) to interrupt stun-immune targets. With Rebuke (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96231/rebuke/) baseline, this functionality is no longer necessary.<br />

Divine Storm (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53385/divine-storm/) weapon damage percent increased from 80% to 100%.<br />
Hand of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/76672/hand-of-light/) (Mastery): A percentage of the damage done by Templar’s Verdict (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85256/templars-verdict/), Crusader Strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/35395/crusader-strike/), and Divine Storm (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53385/divine-storm/) is done as additional Holy damage. This Mastery now grants a 2.1% increase to Holy damage per mastery, down from 2.5%.<br />
Repentance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/20066/repentance/) is no longer broken from damage done by Censure (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31803/censure/) (Seal of Truth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31801/seal-of-truth/)).<br />
The Rebuke (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96231/rebuke/) talent has been replaced with a new passive talent, Sacred Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85285/sacred-shield/). Paladins who had Rebuke before will automatically have Sacred Shield. Sacred When reduced below 30% health, paladins gain the Sacred Shield effect. The Sacred Shield absorbs X damage and increases healing received by 20%. Lasts 15 seconds. This effect cannot occur more than once every 30 seconds. Undispellable.<br />
Seals of Command (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/20375/seal-of-command/) will no longer trigger twice on each swing with Seal of Truth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31801/seal-of-truth/).<br />

Paladin Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
The Silence debuff from Avenger's Shield (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31935/avengers-shield/) was using the Dazed visual effect, and its Daze debuff did not have a visible effect. This has been remedied.<br />
The damage bonus from Communion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31876/communion/) is no longer applied even when the paladin has no paladin auras active.<br />
Divine Storm (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/53385/divine-storm/) no longer incorrectly highlights when Hand of Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/76672/hand-of-light/) procs.<br />

Pursuit of Justice (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/26023/pursuit-of-justice/) is now providing Holy Power when the paladin gets stunned by the Fire mage talent Impact. Conversely, Pursuit of Justice is no longer granting Holy Power (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/25829/holy-power/) when the Paladin is hit by Holy Wrath (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/2812/holy-wrath/).<br />

This has been adjusted.<br />
The tooltip for Tower of Radiance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/85512/tower-of-radiance/) indicated that Holy Light (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/635/holy-light/) would generate a charge of Holy Power (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/25829/holy-power/). This has been fixed.<br />

And as it says, its PTR patch notes, not live server to 4.0.6 patch notes.<br />
<br />
I mean there is several things I feel is missing in the priest disci list like the mana regain change from when shields are fully absorbed, from about 1/1.75/2.5 to 2/4/6 %.<br />
<br />
And this one is correct on the PTR from one patch to another, but not from live to 4.0.6: &quot;Holy Concentration now increases the amount of mana regeneration from Spirit while in combat by an additional 15/30%, down from 20/40%.&quot; Its currently at 10/20%. So its kinda going up, and not down.<br />

This isn't a fix for ferals. What needed to happen was making shifting have more cost. What they should have done with nerf the mana return on leader of the pack so it would make shifting something they can do for a kill opportunity or they can wait for a dispel. So instead they took away all a fearls mobility in turn breaking a main function of the class.</div></div><hr />

For what? Fixing SOME of what should never have been shipped broken in the first place? <br />
<br />
I still don't see where they're fixing the pvp trinkets.<br />
<br />
In case you're wondering, the spellpower trinkets are currently proc'ing as attack power instead of spellpower.<br />
<br />
Has Ghostcrawler found those sub rogues in raids that he was looking for? I think not. I suggest he might want to reverse-engineer to get the bottom of the issue.</div></div><hr />

It's been for a while on PTR. It's a resto specialization, it's not a talent. Another spit in the face of feral druids.. Like stupid resto can't alredy cleanse most of the root effects, OR sucks in pvp, OR needs root breaker as much.. you know, you can cast heals from 40yd range. Basically blizz said &quot;resto or gtfo&quot; once again.<br />

<br />
the doom day for feral has come. in before mass accounts cancellation and a shitstorm from all those &quot;majority&quot; that didnt follow PTR changes and are gonna have a sweet surprise. honestly what was blizz thinking ignoring all the tons of feedback from ptr, that the vocal minority are clueless and meaningless? why dont you remove ptr forums and servers them.. overall it's the worst patch ever happened in wow, broke a lot more pvp balance than fixed, and the communication with devs was completely non existant.<br />
<br />
It's been for a while on PTR. It's a resto specialization, it's not a talent. Another spit in the face of feral druids.. Like stupid resto can't alredy cleanse most of the root effects, OR sucks in pvp, OR needs root breaker as much.. you know, you can cast heals from 40yd range. Basically blizz said &quot;resto or gtfo&quot; once again.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: lol frost mages...<br />
<br />
People like you need to understand there is a world outside of PvP. It's because of QQ'ers like you that all 3 mage specs 'were' unviable in PvE in Cata before the hotfixing and intro of 4.0.6 and probably still will be for some time to come especially with the ill thought out mechanics.</div></div><hr />

PvPers dont mass cancel, they will just fotm over to another spec/class like they usually do<br />
<br />
1) play the most OP spec available<br />
2) claim your sucess is because your awesome<br />
3) ...<br />
4) profit!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You over-estimate the amount of lol-fotm jumpers crowd. They arent that numerous and people laugh at them, because usually they are really bad, they need an OP class/spec to have at least some success. Not to mention that all of them have already rerolled frost mages. <br />
<br />
People that are remotely serious about PvP or are just competent players overall invest a lot more time into their chosen class/spec, they wont just reroll. And in case of feral rolling resto is like rolling another class. It's not like mage or hunter or warrior etc cuz your feral gear is useless for resto. You are gonna have to farm it all over again, and spend thousands gold for gems/enchants and endless hours of pvp-currency farming. Not to mention that it completely changes your game style, 180 degree turn. Why would i want to toss those stupid girly heals, i hate healing, i dont want it, this isnt my thing. And after 6 years of playing feral druid i wont just lol-fotm to another successful class, im gonna cancel my sub.. until blizzard fixes my spec. Im not paying them for a service that they have failed to deliver. As simple as that. And im not alone. ALL the ferals that are remotely serious about their class feel and think the same. <br />
<br />
So, yeah, mass cancellation inc. Mark my word. And perhaps a few weeks later when &quot;the guys upstairs&quot; check out and see a significant subs drop would ask the devs what the hell is going on and have them revert the idiocy of the nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is this madness ? This have been a staple of WoW since forever! What right does Blizzard think they have fixing 5 year old bugs now all of a sudden ?? And don't think I don't know why!!<br />
<br />
&quot;The corpses of Valiona and Theralion will adhere to the laws of gravity and fall to the ground if killed during phase transitions.&quot; <br />
<br />
So when you start getting a ton of GM reports that they have to fix loot for raids that can't loot bosses that are floating in mid air then you suddenly manage to fix corpses falling to the ground!</div></div><hr />

That's only going to happen during Tier changes. (i.e. 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, etc.)<br />

Interesting changes for Fury. I think they're going to be able to blow up more than 1 person now with the Recklessness change. Sucks to be Arms though. WTB some sort of Prot change...(like 60% damage reduction back on shield wall by default :P)</div></div><hr />

The entangling roots glyph change, was relevant for raids guilds stacking druids to insta root adds blizz didn't like that.<br />
They dont want any class to really have the upper hand on any fight hence all the buffs/nerfs looking at you hunters (except mages of course :P j/k any smart person knows mages suck in pve) <br />
As a resto druid i agree with the fact they should have changed the clearcasting thing but this roots change needed to happen, or else people would just cheat there way through more raids by stacking druids (Wasn't just the paragon feral cat thing that people were stacking druids for)</div></div><hr />

Ah thanks for the clarification.<br />
I don't know much about hunter beside the fact that surv rules everything atm but seeing this changes <br />
-Aimed Shot weapon damage has been increased to 200%, up from 150%<br />
-Arcane Shot damage has been increased by 15%.<br />
-Hunters can now use Auto Shot while moving<br />
-Kill Command's damage has been increased by 20%.<br />
-Kill Shot's attack power scaling has been increased by 50%<br />
<br />
-Black Arrow damage has been reduced by 15%.<br />
-Explosive Shot damage has been reduced by 15%.<br />
-Into the Wilderness (passive) has been reduced to a 10% Agility increase, down from 15%.<br />
<br />
Thought that <br />
BUFF(arcane_shot + aimed_shot + auto_shot + kill_command_dmg + kill_command_scaling) &gt; NERF(black_arrow + explosive_shot + into_wild)</div></div><hr />

SV nerf was justified when this patch was 1st announced. When we were all in blues. However time as shown us, once again, that SV doesn't scale particularly well and if you look at parses for heroic modes they are mid table. The MM changes, if certain ones do go live (which they look they are), will mean its well, well ahead of SV and BM. <br />
<br />
All I can say his HELLO 60k (+18k over 8secs) Aimed shot crits... this is with 359 gear and will scale stupidly well with weapon damage, agility, crit and haste.</div></div><hr />

This actually is pretty much the return of cleave spam for aoe, so I wouldnt call it useless.<br />
The old Inner rage was waaaaaaay worse, using it in barely 1 encounter (al'akir) in ph2 for 10sec then canceling it,<br />
or &quot;cheat&quot; using it with bloodsurge procs in macros.<br />
<br />
While it could be turned onto something much more usefull,at least now its not nearly useless.<br />
Its an AoE boost, possibly a minor boost for single target during hero/bloodlust.<br />
It wasnt supposed to be a powerful dps cooldown to start with anyway but rather something to help you waste resources.</div></div><hr />

Yeah because you don't provide a 3% damage buff which raids don't usually bring the arcane mage or bm hunter because they have different and better dps specs while the ret paladin is in fact the highest dps of the three classes mentioned so you will get a raid spot and being in middle of the pack is decent mr. hybrid.</div></div><hr />

Taking away our fear breaker, cutting our bleed damage, axing a core mechanic that has been around since the beginning of time, and reducing bear damg all at the same time? Yea, nothing at all. Nerfing feral pvp is fine, crushing it while letting other obviously more op specs get off with hardly a scratch is infuriating. Don't tell people they don't have a right to be pissed, getting hit like this while DKs and frost mages continue to faceroll their way to top elo is more than justified.<br />

Currently, his melee swing is considered a Cleave type attack and it cannot be blocked, dodged, or parried. This should not be the case. A boss that has a continuous unavoidable melee is ridiculous. This boss can actually be entirely pet tanked by a Hunter or Warlock due to the fact that pets don't take very much damage from boss type mechanics that would kill your pet and you can't really avoid. I have seen it done and it is ridiculous. I put in a ticket and Blizz said they'd look into it... They didn't look very far.</div></div><hr />

And as it says, its PTR patch notes, not live server to 4.0.6 patch notes.<br />
<br />
I mean there is several things I feel is missing in the priest disci list like the mana regain change from when shields are fully absorbed, from about 1/1.75/2.5 to 2/4/6 %.<br />
<br />
And this one is correct on the PTR from one patch to another, but not from live to 4.0.6: &quot;Holy Concentration now increases the amount of mana regeneration from Spirit while in combat by an additional 15/30%, down from 20/40%.&quot; Its currently at 10/20%. So its kinda going up, and not down.<br />
<br />
And I bet there is simular things on all the other classes.<br />
<br />
You do realize that just because something shows up in the PTR patch notes that it's not guaranteed to make it into live right? The Druid spell Rejevenation originally went down to 16% base mana, and even went live as 16% in a hotfix, but now it's up to 20% in the patch.. i'm guessing because they felt that 16% was too much of a drop. <br />
<br />
It's silly to assume it's &quot;missing&quot; from the notes when in reality, it's probably a change that got pulled from the patch entirely.</div></div><hr />

They dont want any class to really have the upper hand on any fight hence all the buffs/nerfs looking at you hunters (except mages of course :P j/k any smart person knows mages suck in pve) <br />
As a resto druid i agree with the fact they should have changed the clearcasting thing but this roots change needed to happen, or else people would just cheat there way through more raids by stacking druids (Wasn't just the paragon feral cat thing that people were stacking druids for)<br />
That wasn't the point, nice try though. Maybe next time you should read and think before you assume things and hit post.<br />
<br />
The point was that they changed the insta root glyph to a reduced cast time and fixed a bug so that the glyph of instant roots (which no longer exists) wouldn't consume clearcasting. Basicly, fixed a bug that wasn't even an issue anymore.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to point out that druids can still cast root on those mobs so the glyph does little to affect that. I can almost assure you that the nerfed insta root glyph is a direct result of how OP it was in PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Icebound Fortitude now breaks stuns when used, in addition to providing immunity to them.<br />
<br />
Blizz said - no more anti-control in this game. we don't want to be like - button vs button. and what is that? how does it calls? Blizz - are the silly and rude liers.<br />
<br />
PS then get palladins passive stun-remover for Hand of Freedom too, liers!<br />
<br />
I wasn't happy about this either. Now they have a stun break, a fear/charm/sap/hex/sheep break, all with immunties to those effects as well as anti magic shell.<br />
<br />
p.s. Ret Paladins no longer have stun breaking Hand of Freedom, try and keep up =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you should do the same. <br />
<br />
It might be OP if you look at it isolated, but since it is a skill of one of the most broken classes in PvP it was not in any way OP.. So now Boomkins have no instant root and a semi-useless silence with a 1 min CD.. Basically all they did for us this patch was fix the mount bug and play around with the lolshrooms... I don´t care what they do to the shrooms, a piece of crap in nice giftwrapping is still a smelly piece og crap. Ferals getting the bat as well. I really hate Blizz trying to force people into resto in PvP.<br />
<br />
Look at the tools of other caster classes and then look at moonkins. The difference is huge, and those retards have the nerve to talk about balance?? Guess they play frost mages in PvP the lot of em. PvP has rarely been more imbalanced. Thx Blizz for ruining any chance moonkins had in PvP. Idiots.</div></div><hr />

thats what i said =))<br />
<br />
P.S. and now they must get for us -passive- stun-remover for Hand of Freedom. because thay took it away.<br />
like a logic of Blizz - no more anti-control for all classes, except death knights. only dks must have all anti-control abilities versus all classes. heroic class... balance, what can I say?</div></div><hr />

(Who knows, maybe some developer's wife/girlfriend decides to to play a certain class, and gives them hell at home until he gives her godmode or something close, seriously buy that nagging bitch a pair of diamond earrings to shut her up and fix the friggin game. 2 years of loladins, and now we gonna have 2 years of frost mages...)<br />
<br />
And what about everyone else, some classes have been waiting for years to be PvP viable, guess they can wait a few more right?</div></div><hr />

The old Design of that Talent activated SotS once you casted PW:S on yourself, making you immun to silence and such. It has now be altered into activating Inner Focus, forming said CD into an Oh shit Button of sorts in PvP. In short, the &quot;oneself&quot; part only referred to the old design of using a spell you could cast on others onto yourself.<br />
Also it becomes longer, but you don't have a shield up instantly. However its also usable when you have the Weakened Soul debuff so I really don't know wether it's a fix, buff, or nerf:P</div></div><hr />

Right, because warriors have such an easy time against mages, too.<br />

Also facepalm to all ppl QQing, most probably haven't even tested the changes live and are just crying because they're seeing lower numbers. Every change blizz does to the game and to the classes is for a reason, and if something turns out imba they'll fix that in another patch. The game can't be 100% balanced anyways that's impossible, so stop crying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
* Sound shouldn't become de-synced during encounters with large amounts of sound effects.<br />
* Sound shouldn't cut out when there are a large amount of sound effects being played at once.<br />
* There should no longer be delays on some sounds in select situations.<br />
whatever they did to fix sound only made it worse on my end.<br />
most of the time, sound is fine.<br />
the REALLY bad thing happens in 25m raids (25 only, not in 10). when i enter combat in 25m, i'm getting a sequential saturated sound and a variable fps loss.<br />
why can't they go back to the way it was before 4.0 ?</div></div><hr />
