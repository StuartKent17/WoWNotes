I can't agree more. Exactly what we have been discussing ourselves in guild.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Particle</div><div class="date">2018-07-25, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">8 days and couting! That 25% nerf in mobs damage did pretty much NOTHING! Leveling from 1 to 100 is still DOG SHIT. My mage with Full Heirloom + Enchanted Gear(Ring, Neck, Staff, Cloak, Shoulders) had to cast 5-7 spells for EACH mob to kill. Each spell taking 2.1 sec to cast! Not couting the time I was running away or the time I lost while dead running back to my corpse(2+ mobs = you are pretty much dead).<br />
And then BOOM! I got into legion content and I was killing stuff with 2 cast! I could pull the whole fucking map and stay alive!<br />
After I got my mage to 100 to level up from 100 to 110 with invasions, I decided to level up my paladin. Oh boy. I was spamming dungeons as a tank. If I dont time my shit Im totally dead and I will WIPE my group. It really feels like im doing Mythic+ 10 or some shit from lvl 20 to lvl 100. Healers have to drink before pretty much every pack! Holy paladins CANT keep people alive if the group get some kind of AoE burst. Most dungeons have some kind of bugged spell that will one shot someone or the entire group. Monks and Druid tanks cant really stay alive at all! And I get myself in situations where I HAVE TO HEAL as a tank! If I dont help my healer someone will just die! Bosses take forever and almost every boss enrages. I cant imagine how many new players who doenst understand what the fuck is going on will just forget about the game and stop playing it.<br />
I love blizzard and I will always come back to WoW no matter what... but this time blizzard really really really fucked up. Im so fucking <br />
disappointed.<br />
<br />
Edit: Every single trash mob in Dire Maul enrages! Trash mobs in Zul'farrak start to run and pull everything cus they take forever to die. The Shirrak boss in Auchenai Crypts applies his debuff to everyone in 551 yards with his Inhibit Magic(Cant kill him at all). I could point more but why tho? I've been reporting bugs since 8.0 and not a single hotfix yet. Im not going to take my time to report bugs anymore. Also, the lvl 60 or 70(I dont really remember) fly passive shows 2 times(If you dont have it yet) in your skill list.</div></div><hr />

I made a DK and I got 9k HP @ 62 while my death strike heals for like 600 (even if you do it after a big burst). The game is just so broken and boring with these mobs in dungeons taking 10 years to clear. Spent hours leveling for like 4 levels and that's as a tank with fast queues, enchanted heirlooms. Healers spamming me while I also death strike and I still can't stay alive if I pull more than 3 mobs</div></div><hr />

Afaik they're not nerfing Antorus so more people can do it (like they usually do at the end of an expansion), but they're adjusting/fixing the encounters for ilvl squish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're not nerfing them. They're adjusting things that were broken after the squish. Applying an aura would either make all other abilities completely pointless, or not solve the problem at hand which is that certain abilities are completely untenable for the difficulty at hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2nd boss there on m+ 17 was insane too...the outgoing damage was crazy high and was one-shotting the tank with arcane missiles. Also, he seemed to be spamming spells way faster than I remember...<br />
