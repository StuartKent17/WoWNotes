Legion - Account Wide Challenge Mode Weapon Transmog<br />
The long asked question about transmogging Challenge Mode weapons has finally been answered! <br />
Will players that completed WOD challenge modes unlock all the weapon models for xmog? If not seems unfair to some classes.<br />
In #Legion you will be able to purchase a token that will unlock all Challenge Mode weapon appearances account-wide!<br />
<br />
To clarify, only players who have completed all the Warlords of Draenor Challenge Mode Golds will be able to buy this token. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/399258-draenor-cm-weapons-legion-transmog/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17288700635?page=1#11))<br />
<br />
Yep! Glad to hear this has gotten around, as we haven't been ignoring this topic at all. In fact, this is something that we've been discussing for quite some time. We wanted to be certain that we could completely decided on the plans for these weapons before we said anything. <br />
<br />
We'd rather not make promises we aren't completely certain we can keep. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/399234-wod-cm-weapon-transmogging-in-legion-resolved/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20419913969?page=2#30))<br />

Legion - Discipline Priest Artifact Intro<br />
The first 1:30 of this video is the same intro as Shadow Priest, so feel free to skip it if you still remember what happens. <br />
<br />
This intro rewards you with Light's Wrath (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/128868-lights-wrath). You can see all of the models for it on our Artifact Weapons page (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/985-Legion-Artifact-Weapons).<br />

FEEDBACK: Violet Hold (Normal)<br />
Violet Hold is open and updated for Legion! We'll have a video soon, but it still plays much like the previous version.<br />
Please use this thread to post any feedback on the Violet Hold dungeon. When posting, please note your group composition and any relevant information about the nature of your group (e.g. random LFG group, Mythic raider guildmates, etc.). At this stage, a lot of overall combat balance is in flux, but we're still very interested in hearing overall feedback and impressions of the experience and mechanics.<br />
<br />
Killed all trash up to first boss, Anub'esset spawned as first escaped prisoner. We killed it and we never got credit for killing &quot;First Escaped Prisoner&quot; and then had to leave because nothing would spawn.<br />
Thanks for the report - we have a fix going out shortly that should resolve this issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Necrolytes are a creation of Gul'dan, warlocks trained in necromancy per WC2. WoW Magazine states Necrolytes used void, making<br />
warcraft 1 initially, trained by kil'jaeden, very demonic in nature, hence a warlock thing (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/689707949971767296))<br />

<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
<br />
I liked you and still do, I just don't agree much with your homogenize everything.<br />
Without some of that, paladins and druids were doomed to heal. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689542825105498112))<br />
<br />
has a point; some of the &quot;homogenization&quot; done to wow classes helped allow pallies, druids, etc to do more then &quot;role x&quot;<br />
I feel we (and I take blame) were too sensitive to player concerns about e.g. I can't compete on AE damage on this one fight. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689605237846335489))<br />
I don't apologize for breaking up bringing the shaman for lust (and that's the only reason to bring them). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689605784678768642))<br />
When we first made DKs, raids told us they couldn't bring them because they didn't fit in the raid group Tetris. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689606498947731456))<br />
So we said it should be about bringing competent players not about classes with mandatory buffs. That was &quot;Bring the player.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689606740065685506))<br />
So if I could do it again, I would homogenize less but still wouldn't advocate &quot;You must bring me since I buff Shadow damage&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689607313989042176))<br />

I dont see it much different from WoD version... people who did wod cms get the rewards accountwide, but people who did pandaria do not get them accountwide.<br />
Speaking of reward exclusivity... you can do both expansion CMs but you still wont get pandaria sets accountwide.</div></div><hr />

The token will allow you to buy the CM weapons on all of your characters. Meaning, the ones that you did not go and buy the weapons on already. It doesn't unlock them for free, as far as we know, so you haven't &quot;wasted&quot; anything.<br />

I believe the main reason they're doing this for WoD is that some classes have an advantage over others when it comes to weapons. I.E., a Warrior is able to use more weapon types than a Priest. So there is an imbalance. Everyone was even in MoP so it's a different situation.</div></div><hr />

Hmm I mean, I got only my hunter with Gold CM, so when the transmog system was announced I bought the 'cool' ones in the hopes my hunter ( even though he cant use em all ) could 'unlock' it for all my chars. So I think I did waste it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice logic bruh. <br />
<br />
If it was about subs, they'd make it so that you'd have to unlock the weapons on a class basis, like the MoP CM sets, and not allow you to unlock all weapons with one character. More boosts would be purchased and more subs would be paid to get it done before WoD Challenge Mode weapons are unobtainable with Legion.<br />
<br />
They did this because it's what the players have asked for. MoP CM sets are account-wide for the class they belong to, Legion weapons will be account-wide and only require you to finish CM Gold on 1 character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm confused. First Blizzard is desperate for subs, which if it was true would mean they would NOT introduce such an item and would force you to do them on multiple characters.<br />
<br />
Then &quot;Everyone will run with those in legion&quot;, which: a) contradicts your later statement &quot;those wepaons look like crap&quot; and b) maybe you missed the memo, but artifacts are coming and pretty much all of them look better than the CM weapons. <br />
<br />
I understand you will feel less &quot;special&quot;, but if you were that &quot;special and unique&quot; you would have already unlocked all your MoP sets. Unless, of course it's just for the sake of whining.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because those rewards were always confined to one set each as reward, while the weapons were all of them, just limited to what you class could actually use. It's a very logical move on Blizz's part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still don't like it.. : / I'd gladly pay 10k for each item slot on each character to get it on the current main. Also I won't be needing the WoD CM weapons, as I do like the models I get as a DK. But perhaps I should get it done, just incase, only got two golds so far, haven't really tried to get it.</div></div><hr />

Just because your guild doesn't want a hunter doesn't mean you HAVE to stop playing it in your spare time. Would make you a very sad individual if you did everything your guild asked...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mind changing classes to stay in the same guild I have stayed in for years, and if we needed a DK and I had a DK as an alt in MoP. So I decided to drop the hunter and play DK in WoD. <br />
<br />
No idea why helping my guild, and friends, makes me an sad indiviual. :confused: Especially when I lose nothing, but can continue to play a long with friends I set over a class. <br />
Of course I could most likely have stayed hunter, and we could have hoped someone else would roll DK, or perhaps even recruit one (but then have to bench one of our raiders). But as I allready had one, that was almost fully HC SoO geared from alt/pug runs and ready to go, it just seemed like the obvious choice. Also I am not one of those that have played the same role for 10 years. Vanilla - Rogue and Pala. TBC - Hunter. pala and rogue. WotLK - Pala, rogue, warrior. MoP - Hunter, Pala, DK and finally in WoD - DK, Pala, Rogue, Warlock. (From Main decending to least played Alt in respected order). <br />
So I really don't mind helping 19 others people out when needed : )<br />
<br />
You however sounds like a sad individual that have to go and place judgement on those who plays/enjoys the game in a different way than you.<br />

Some people have lives outside the game.<br />
<br />
Actually, my most trusted friends are from online gaming, friends I have talked with almost daily for many years. Also my IRL friends have been playing in the same guild as me for many years as well, so that is kinda my &quot;social thang&quot;. I do of course have a life outside of the online community, with work, visiting friends IRL and going to pubs or what not, just as any other normal being.</div></div><hr />
