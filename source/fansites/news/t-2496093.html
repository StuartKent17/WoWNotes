<br />
All rares on the island can drop Yellow Punch Cards, I've had one drop on like 8 different ones. <br />
<br />
I think Uncle T'rogg just has an vastly increased chance. (I think I've had one drop on every kill but one for him)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caerule</div><div class="date">2019-07-08, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice to have a guide like this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">matolen</div><div class="date">2019-07-08, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not seeing this listed anywhere but an epic shield (ilvl 395) dropped from one of the rares on Mechagon. I am assuming it is part of the rare's loot table -- or a Mechagon world drop that happened to be on from the rare for my kill. I want to say it was Jawbreaker. <br />
<br />
It obviously was meant to pair with the whirring chainblade, as it features a rotating saw in the shield and the color and art are complementary.</div></div><hr />

Yes they are, right where it says 'location'</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at &quot;Location&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StillMcfuu</div><div class="date">2019-07-08, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some Rares actually have 2 spawn locations, Arachnid also spawns in future Mechagon which is unaffected by present. Same loot table, I got my mount from future Arachnid. It still counts as one kill per day though, so no killing current then jumping to future. But Future is usually always up if you want a quick farm everyday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I thought this as well, but in your defense, the list is bulleted when it should be numbered. The person that created this list probably doesn't work a white collar job.</div></div><hr />
