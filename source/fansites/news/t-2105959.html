You misunderstood my question, it implies that the playerbase has had vastly inconsitant feelings about the Legenday system, basically you have 2 camps of people. <br />
<br />
Those that got lucky RNG and got good Legendary's love it, those that got unlucky RNG and got useless Legendary's hate it...surely you can agree this is not what Blizzard wanted in their Legendary design no matter which side of the fence you are on.</div></div><hr />

Any plans to change items, so that they are more exciting? all items are just some flat passive bonus to dmg/health. I'd like armor with unique properties, equipeffects, use-ability or similar. Currently It feels very &quot;fasion souls&quot;-like and not it's not interesting getting new loot - except sometimes trinkets. <br />
<br />
Artifact weapons are cool. but they mainly just provided passive buffs. Something you mentioned was boring about the old classic talent tree, which you got rid of. (Yay, level up, now i have 1% more crit). Could this be changed, so that the golden traits are use-abilities instead of more passive? I know it can complicate rotations etc. but it also makes the gameplay more fun and interesting. <br />
<br />
Will there be added more glyphs? there's a pathetic amount for hunters, for example. Multiple glyphs per skill, could be awesome. (so we have choices)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Going back to questions:<br />
<br />
If it's not too cheeky I would like to be responded to two questions. One deals about legendary system and the other deals about the wow progressive patches.<br />
<br />
1: The legendary system though unconsistent has revealed that as more you play more chances you have to get a legendary. But (for example in my case) I have had the bad luck of getting two quite bad legendaries (almost for their stats) For my warrior I got the prydaz necklace and the earth legs, which are one of worst both because of their stats. I have wondered how RNG issues enter in the appearing of the legendaries. I mean, what determines that you get that exact legendary and not anyone else, and if the probability to get a BiS legendary is rigged or not. I would like to know also if there are some work related to the priority of the BiS legendaries or the introduction of flexible changes on legendarie's stats depending on the spec you are currently performing(In my case arms(Main)-protection-fury)<br />
<br />
2. And the second question is about the rush of the following content. Personally i'm a semi-hardcore player who likes to enjoy the most difficult content, and my thought is that the patches (althought I value and appreciate the worth done by Blizzard in this expansion) I got the impression of a great hastening in the patch updates. And my question is: Basing on your current and future plans on WoW, when do you estimate this expansion will end? <br />
<br />
Thanks for all, and forgive me if I commit any grammar or syntax mistake (English is not my mother tongue)</div></div><hr />

Is Blizzard interested into drawing these groups of people back into Mythic Raiding in some way in the future ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1-You guys said you are planning to make AK instantly researched up to around level 10. Do we still need to provide order resources for those instant researches?<br />
<br />
2-Why did you remove gear impact on pvp? You guys said pvp should be about skill not gear, then why didn't you make pvp an even field. You guys keep saying there is a minor difference but why is it even there? Most of the time its an advantage towards pve gear. I am a myhthic raider and casual pvper around 1700-1800 rating I don't use a single pvp item when I am pvping. Would it be ok if item level had a minor difference in pve like it is in pvp?</div></div><hr />

Example, melee (with short cooldown interrupts are super popular in pvp). Therefore, healers all preferred the level 22 talent for interrupt protection over other things in that row (because interrupt protection was godly). Result: interrupt protection was nerfed to &quot;reduced duration of interrupts&quot;. It wasn't the the other talents would have been bad in another row. We need help vs. the melee dominance. The talent will still be overwhelmingly dominant but just won't work as well (all healers are weaker).</div></div><hr />

Transmogrification: Could we see more, no spefic transmogrify items. So purely cosmetic ( so no stats). They could drop from anything. Think like the armor we could get from our garrison in Warlords. <br />
<br />

<br />
Request for small holiday: Remember the fallen ( or : hero's fall ) leaders: 2/3 days of remembering Tyrion, Vol,jin, Varian ?<br />
<br />
crafting: Make the reagent tab a shared bank across all alts on 1 server. Allot less hassle to get items from point a to point b.<br />

<br />
WoW vanilla and every expansion since, has featured boars, different skins, different zones, but essentially they were all relative to the original boars way back when.<br />
<br />
Legion is the very first expansion not to feature a boar type mob, why is this? Do they realise how iconic they are and they've been disregarded in such a cruel way?<br />
<br />
Also, there is also the curious thing that bacon drops exist, such as those from specific mobs you turn in for a WQ, for which you get bacon as a reward. Now, i'm not being funny, but bears do not give you bacon. It seems as though the intention to include boars was there but they never made it into the game, so bacon was thrown onto the loot table of random mobs, thinking we wouldn't notice. Well sir, I did, I did indeed, and I want to know if boars are planned for a future patch, maybe some sort of invasion, is the next expansion going to have a boar theme? So many questions, and all because somebody forgot to put boars in the legion files.</div></div><hr />

A lot of players feel that it's the opposite of exciting and a lot of the big warcraft youtubers are highly against it.<br />
<br />
Getting &lt;insert item here&gt; from &lt;insert dungeon or raid here&gt; in TBC felt exciting. Getting an item in Legion is closer to disappointment or apathy since it'll be replaced quickly and always could've been better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What? The way we get them meaning &quot;I can't have instant access&quot;?<br />

This random drop is fair for everyone, for those who play a lot, and those who don't play much, the chance of seeing them is essentially the same. Any effect they have cannot be considered underwhelming, a ring is a ring, or a belt is a belt, either way, as soon as you add something extra to it, it becomes much more interesting, whether you want that effect is purely personal, some will like the benefit of a legendary more than others, it is impossible to please everyone.

3) Brawler Guild: How many ranks should be expect? 8 again with some old bosses removed, or more than 8 ranks? And how hard will the &quot;raid&quot; boss be?<br />

<br />
#1 the person you are responding to did NOT say instant access or even hint at it.<br />
<br />
#2 when in the past has a legendary not been worn by some raiders WITHIN THE SAME TIER?, underwhelming is a correct term.<br />
<br />
#3 if you ever try to make food that satisfies everybody within a large group of people, you will have bland and boring food that satisfies nobody. Focus on fun and dont listen to the balance/pvp/difficulty rage nerds because they will ruin the game.</div></div><hr />

Basically as a scholar. Today i am a freelancer, who can't effort to commit 4 days/week on an exact same time/day frame with 90+% attendance for half a year. This basically pushes me out to play the game on the difficulty where my skillset meets other players, giving me the only option to go heroic, which i cleared in terms of Emerald Nightmare in the first week as a PUG-leader. So basically my question: When can high skilled players, who can't commit to a high rank raid schedule expect to participate on their proper difficulty? Why is mythic raiding still not cross-realm possible for example?</div></div><hr />

Acting like prestige is progression doesn't cut it...try making ilvl/gear nearly meaningless in PVE and see if raid progression comes to a near end or the same for mythic+. If you remove gear progression aspect from the game in PVE it would kill PVE, the same has happened for me with PVP...I feel no real incentive to PVP or &quot;show off&quot; the awesome loot I get. <br />

This wouldn’t affect the chances for legendaries but would allow us a way to avoid the least useful ones for our class/spec. It would also mean when you have found 3 or 4 you can realistically have a reasonable chance of acquiring the truly desired legendary. <br />
<br />
I know as a Protection Warrior I have Sephuz's Secret and Thundergod's Vigor. Thundergod's is awesome and has changed my playstyle. However, the ring is useful for Mythic+ wearing it really hurts my overall survivability compared to other options. While I understand that I cannot target Mannoroth's Bloodletting Manacles and Kakushan's Stormscale Gauntlets with the current system, some avoidance of undesired legendaries would be much appreciated. I know that many classes have far less appealing choices available to their specs.<br />
