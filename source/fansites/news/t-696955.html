Patch 3.3.3 will introduce a couple of VERY interesting changes to professions. The first part of the change is obviously the removal of most of the transmutation cooldowns, it will affect most tiers of crafted items and it wouldn't be surprising to see items like Breastplate of the White Knight (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/67130/breastplate-of-the-white-knight/) drop from 4000 to 2000G at the AH. <br />
<br />
The 2nd part is also very interesting if you're looking for cheap epic gear to start running instances with your alts, all the crafted recipes from Ulduar had their reagents cost considerably lowered and you can expect to find these items for less than 1000G. <br />
<br />
Reminder<br />
Frozo the Renowned (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/40160/frozo-the-renowned/) will let you trade Frozen Orbs for a lot of rare reagents, including Crusader/Runed Orbs and Eternal elements. <br />

Random dungeon 15 minute vote kick limit gone in 3.3.3<br />
It's not mentioned in the notes, but the Vote Kick option no longer has a 15-minute cooldown. Enjoy. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23329213478-did-we-hurt-the-devs-feelings.html))<br />
<br />
Vote kick reason in 3.3.3<br />
This might not answer your question -- which may or may not have been rhetorical anyway -- but we did find that a lot people were clicking &quot;Yes&quot; on the Vote Kick alert, then later asking, &quot;why did we kick that guy?&quot; The idea is to make the person who wants to kick someone from the group give everyone else a reason. If the reason is silly or defamatory, a surprising number of people could very well reject it.<br />
<br />
While many people are quick to take into account all of the worst possible scenarios with any presented changes to the game, we find that those cases are typically the minor fringe cases once the changes are put in action. The patch notes are out and the speculation is brimming, but let's see how things turn out before clenching our crystal balls, shall we? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23329213478-did-we-hurt-the-devs-feelings.html))<br />
<br />
Seasonal bosses only accessible through the Dungeon Finder in 3.3.3<br />
Yes, the Dungeon Finder must be used. The interface will have a separate selection for special World Event bosses in dungeons. If players zone into the dungeon without using the Dungeon Finder, the bosses will not be there. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23329143450-please-clarify-333-world-event-bosses.html))<br />
<br />
On-Proc Talents changed to Auras in 3.3.3<br />
We made those changes for a few reasons.<br />
<br />
Basically, they are balanced around more-or-less 100% uptime now. We think talents of the variety when X crits, now you can do Y are cool, but these auras really weren't in that category anymore. They were just cute ways of getting a passive buff up. Nobody tended to think Leader of the Pack was boring because it was just on all the time.<br />
<br />
Removing the constant application and removal of these buffs (through both the passive aura and the range increase) might improve performance a tiny bit, will clean out your combat logs (which actually improves performance too), and reduce the UI and in some cases spell effect spam, which might make combat a little more easier to understand.<br />
<br />
There are some auras where location on the battlefield is supposed to matter, such as totems, the imp, shouts, and paladin auras. Those didn't change. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23329534006-why-so-many-auras-in-ptr-notes.html))<br />
<br />
Why not naturally scale DoTs with Haste/Crit?<br />
Having everything benefit from haste or crit is a good goal and ultimately necessary to keep stats that are going to appear on your gear anyway attractive. We don't want to do that for every single ability yet because in some cases those specs don't need that kind of buff and we'd just have to take the damage away from somewhere else.<br />
<br />
Haste is a mixed bag for dots or hots because it makes you cast them more often, using up GCDs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23329143438-why-not-naturally-scale-dots-with-hastecrit.html))<br />

Icy Touch threat bonus in 3.3.3<br />
We wanted Icy Touch to feel a little like Shield Slam -- the big hit you could launch when you need a lot of threat to say grab a recently spawned add. I don't think most DKs will mind having a little more single target threat overall, but we don't want to turn them into a rotation of all Icy Touch. If that happens, we might have to notch the threat down a little more. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23329393527-icy-touch-change--good--bad.html))<br />
<br />
Will of the Necropolis Cooldown Removal (Check the original post (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23329103342-333-patch-notes.html) for more details) <br />
I think attributing so much power to Will of the Necropolis is one of those consequences of trying to covert everything into effective health. In fact, the reason we took the cooldown off is because we don't think it will be that noticeable.<br />
<br />
In the theoretical case where the DK is ping-ponging between 40% and 20% health, it's crazy good (as is Ardent Defender), but those situations don't happen often. (They might happen more in Cataclysm, where it would be nice to see tanks at 50% health for more than a fraction of a second.) Most of the time, Will of the Necropolis is just extra health, which was the case before we removed the cooldown.<br />
<br />
We added the cooldown during PTR testing in which we had a Patchwerk who kept stacking his own damage. When he was hitting for 110% of the tank's entire bar, the DK with Will of the Necropolis could survive, and nobody else could. Duh. In retrospect we probably overreacted, since we don't actually make boss encounters like that. You have say Steelbreaker Fusion Punch, but those hits aren't so often that the 15 sec cooldown is the issue.<br />
<br />
[...] Seriously though, the only thing that changed on Will of the Necropolis was the cooldown. The health savings were always there. Tanks typically are at full health, avoid every other attack, get hit, and then get topped off. We typically don't hit tanks more often than 15 sec with really big attacks. It will perform as it always has against periodic attacks, including Soul Reaper (which is a 30 sec cooldown IIRC). If the pure melee hits from the Lich King allow DKs to literally take 15% less damage from him at all times, then we might put a 5 sec cooldown on it instead or make it work like Ardent Defender (which only reduces the damage that took you over the threshold). Against most bosses I'd be surprised if you even noticed the cooldown was gone.<br />
<br />
Remember, you're looking at current content with current gear and we are forecasting slightly into the future with changes like this. <br />
<br />
[...] But like I said, if it looks like it's going to be a problem, we'll add a small cooldown or something back on. I think it's too premature to do that yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23329103342-333-patch-notes.html))<br />
<br />
3.3.3 Will of the Necropolis in the Lich King Encounter<br />
We talked over the WotN change with Daelo and the guys who made Soul Reaper. They're not convinced it will be a problem. When someone trivializes the encounter with an undergeared DK, then we'll start worrying about it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23329103342-333-patch-notes.html))<br />
<br />
Frost potential changes<br />
We realize there are still some things that need to be fixed in the tree. The Icy Talons chain of talents feels pretty expensive. Killing Machine can be hard to use. Stuff like that. I can't promise we'll get all of that taken care of quickly, but we'll get it taken care of eventually.<br />
<br />
I don't recall us buffing the Gylph of Obliterate from 20% to 25% as has been reported. It's possible I just forgot or there may be something else going on. I will investigate more next week. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418944814-frost-dks-left-in-the-dust.html))<br />
<br />
Glyph of Chains of Ice<br />
One change we have made in the interim is to make Chains of Ice apply Frost Fever baseline, and keep the current (live) Glyph of Chains of Ice as is (causing damage). If you don't change your PvP spec at all (and assuming you have a pretty cookie-cutter PvP spec), then you should see extra damage from the Strength in Endless Winter and a Scourge Strike that hits harder on undiseased targets.

Balance burst damage<br />
The patch notes are not done. While, frankly, Tranquility is not something we're going to mess with, we do want to add more burst to Balance for PvP purposes. If some of that spills over into PvE for more damage overall, I don't think many druids would complain. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23329323455-druids-left-out.html))<br />
<br />
Eclipse<br />
As I've said before, the goal isn't merely to get you to use Starfire and Wrath. The goal is to have a rotation that is more than just 12121212 or even 111222111222. RNG is something we actually want. The best players should be the ones who can pay attention and react to situations, not the ones who can mash their keys the fastest (or download the most recent macros).<br />
<br />
The biggest problems with Eclipse are:<br />
<br />
1) It's too much of a damage increase. Here we see the problem with overbudgeted talents. The RNG wouldn't be an issue if the magnitude of those random rolls wasn't so huge.<br />
<br />
2) It suffers too much from movement. Losing an Eclipse proc when you have to run is a problem, particularly given point 1. Now we have no problem with classes taking a dps hit when they have to move and we don't even mind of some specs pay a heavier penalty than others. But it's a problem when the delta between dps when moving and dps when not moving is so great. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23329183196-sugestion-eclipse.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-hunter/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />
Beast Mastery<br />
In my opinion, players spend too much effort trying to compare their rotation to that of other classes or specs that they may not understand as well. Bad Arcane mages mash two buttons and bad BM hunters mash two buttons. You're not going to top charts as Arcane if that's all you do.<br />
<br />
We don't want to buff the pet damage for BM any more for a couple of reasons. One is that it puts too much dependence on the pet. If the pet does 50% of your damage (which is an exaggeration) and the pet dies, then your dps just dropped by 50%. Even if you can get the pet back quickly, you've suffered a lot of damage loss. Secondly, the pet doesn't require that much babysitting. Few players are clicking their pet abilities on and off. As such, it just acts like a dot with cool art. When we talk about the risk of BM being too easy to play, we don't want to over-reward players for just doing Steady and having the pet attack. What I'm saying is that the more damage the pet does, the less the hunter player even has to pay attention. If the pet required more micro-management, then that would change. If pets built up combo points, or Kill Command acted like a Conflag, or something where the hunter had to react, then more pet damage wouldn't be so bad (though the risk of death doesn't go away).<br />
<br />
We'd like to buff BM PvE damage, but we have to be careful not to buff it too much in PvP where it still has really high burst. This means we can't just do things like boost the Arcane Shot damage of Ferocious Inspiration or the like. The damage would have to be more of the slowly stacking / sustained variety, and that's harder to implement. (Technically, it's not hard to implement per se, but it's hard to get it feeling right without causing weird things to player behavior, the talent trees or causing other problems that lead to a two hour fix taking two weeks instead.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23307580939-could-bm-hunters-get-some-help.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-shaman/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?shaman))<br />
Elemental Shamans / Totem of Wrath<br />
As I've said before, the right change to make to Totem of Wrath is to make it grant spell power almost exactly the way Demonic Pact does so, and to make it less of a dps loss for Elemental to use.<br />
<br />
Elemental damage should be in a pretty good place now if you don't drop ToW, so really I think the only risk is if you're in a guild that won't take you because they get a slightly higher buff from their Demo lock and can't afford to bring you both. I'm a little skeptical that that situation happens too frequently based on the number of Elementals we actually see in dungeons and raids. If it happens to you, I apologize (and you don't need to post 'it happens to me!&quot; in this thread) but you might want to sit down with your raid leaders and discuss if the difference is really as great as they think it is.<br />
<br />
I can understand if the inconsistency in the design just offends you, and it is something we want to fix, but please be realistic about how much it would really impact your WoW playing. We thought implementing Flame Shock scaling was more important. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23329343423-ptr-notes-elemental-still-missing-something.html))<br />
<br />
Glyph of Flame Shock<br />
The current (for us) Glyph of Flame Shock does something like let Flame Shock crit at 230% damage. We'll try to get a new patch note up soon. Whatever it ends up as will probably be some relatively simple damage buff to replace the old crit buff.

hello i have a question about this. what if 4 people you dont know queue together and they want a specific item that you want too. so they just kick you even though the reason is not nice. does your debuff get removed, or do you get another 15 minute debuff, or what happens do you think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) no changes to alchemy cooldowns. Transmutes should have separate CD's at minimum. Maybe a CD for Eternals and another for gems, or something like that. Or just remove the CD altogether.<br />
<br />
2) Eclipse. The issue isn't that it does too much damage. The reason Eclipse got buffed is because Balance Druids aren't doing enough, and as we go further into ICC, things haven't changed because Eclipse isn't the issue, it's the RNG. It isn't too powerful, even when we get to stand in one place for the most part, kind of like Festergut, we pretty much break even. We move, and it's massive loss.<br />
<br />
3) Totem of Wrath being unnessary anymore, or elemental damage being in a good place without it right now. Let's get real. The reason elemental is getting buffed is because they aren't in a good place right now... And the issue with ToW isn't new. This is the exact same issue that came up at the end of BC and Elementals were talking about it just before WotLK came out. We said it was a bad design and it's uber in Naxx but the further in the expansion you go, the less it matters. And that obviously hasn't changed, and is something that should have been addressed a long time ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I disagree on that yea, but for example: making the eternals change to another eternal that it SHARES a cooldown with any other is just ridiculous. I don't mind a cooldown on it, but it's shared with anything else and that's what makes it ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Okay enough of the formalities since we're on the same server.<br />
<br />
You don't need to pug anyone. You can still get 4 of your friends from the server and hit up the queue to do the seasonal bosses, at least that's what I'd imagine. I haven't personally made it to the PTR, let alone even download it yet. But, again, I'd imagine it'll work exactly like the random tool does currently. Create a premade group and then just queue up.<br />
<br />
If someone has tested this on the PTR (if it's even up, I'm not sure ATM,) any news or information on it would be great. Just for clarification, by &quot;tested this,&quot; I mean getting 4 people you know and queue-ing up for a seasonal boss without making it a full on pug.</div></div><hr />

It currently works exactly like the random heroic meaning no more two manning the easy bosses with friends as it fills the group <br />
All i see this doing is 3-4 people who want to do events queuing then kicking the 4th/5th as soon as they get ported.. seems like a poor design choice by blizzard <br />

It's not fun to carry a 700 DPS Str-Def Hunter with spellpower gems and dodge trinkets (I have seen that once - it was horrible). Such people simply deserve to be kicked instead to be carried through the entire instance because you can't kick them earlier.</div></div><hr />

As I've said before, the goal isn't merely to get you to use Starfire and Wrath. The goal is to have a rotation that is more than just 12121212 or even 111222111222. RNG is something we actually want. The best players should be the ones who can pay attention and react to situations, not the ones who can mash their keys the fastest (or download the most recent macros).<br />
<br />
The biggest problems with Eclipse are:<br />
<br />
1) It's too much of a damage increase. Here we see the problem with overbudgeted talents. The RNG wouldn't be an issue if the magnitude of those random rolls wasn't so huge.<br />
<br />
2) It suffers too much from movement. Losing an Eclipse proc when you have to run is a problem, particularly given point 1. Now we have no problem with classes taking a dps hit when they have to move and we don't even mind of some specs pay a heavier penalty than others. But it's a problem when the delta between dps when moving and dps when not moving is so great. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23329183196-sugestion-eclipse.html))<br />
<br />
This should be made into a &quot;Your next 5 starfires will have 60% increased chance to critically hit, and 10-15 with wrath with 30% more dmg&quot; just a like 20-30 sec buff you get, so running wont be a problem, and you will still be able to cast all the starfires you usually would with the old eclipse.. <br />
And problem is sorted :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having no cd on the kick option kinda creates few problems, 4 guildies for example hunting certain item on certain dungeon but cant be arsed to walk there, then the one random might want the same item, so they kick him just in case (though this has happened to me after 15 minutes). <br />
And we all enjoy our WTF TANK YOR GS IS LIEK 2000, J00R HP IS LIEK BELOW 30000, MY GUILD HAS DONE 4/12 ICC!, and then you get kicked by 3 dps paladins all having righteous fury on.<br />

Sadly negative patch notes is what got me to register. I guess I should give at least one positive before I start in on what I don't like. I was happy to hear we once again have use for frozen orbs, as most have been vendering them. Frost Lotus can be 75g-100g at times, this should bring that down to a more reasonable level.<br />
<br />
I am a bit disappointed about the tailoring cooldown, as giving the 22 slot bag a 7 day cooldown might have worked if they implemented that stratgy for the next expansion's 24 slot bag. But as it is most people who want the 22 slot bag already have it, so that isn't going to make tailors any money by selling that week long cooldown, and the loss of their specialty cloth cooldown will kill the profits of an already minor income profession.<br />
<br />
What I am most disappointed with is the change to seasonal bosses, forcing players to que in a LFG way to access them. I am not a fan of forcing people to do anything, guess that is the American in me. As such I don't like how the game forces enchanters to DE for the group when the LFG option is selected. By forcing players to be ported to instance, it kills off world pvp. Now I play ally, and there is no &quot;ally seasonal boss&quot; since everyone just uses the remote for brewfest, and the halloween and valentines day bosses are in horde territory. I hated how it was a 30 min travel time to get to the instance, and how all 5 members had to go there, because there were 40 horde waiting at the stone, preventing ally from using it. However, those who liked world pvp had it, now that option is gone. <br />
<br />
Even closer to home is the loot system that is forced on the players who use the LFG system. I first heard about the GDKP loot system on this website, and feel in love with it. I did brewfest, and halloween and now valentines day with that loot system. I was excited when people paid 10,000g for a mount, earning everyone in the group to earn 2,000g for their time. I felt this was much more fair than having people see the mount drop once, and lose the roll. Also, once you win the mount there is no reason to keep doing the seasonal boss anymore, so you don't do him anymore, and the server as a whole gets less summons by your absence. GDKP rewards players for helping others, when you don't need any loot from the boss.<br />
<br />
Before the LFG option was made into heroics, I did GDKP for heroics, people would join them, and the enchanter could do min bids for the blues and purples nobody wanted, and actually make gold by bidding 25g for an epic, then selling the shard on AH for 30g (instead of DEing for free, and buying the shard from the AH for 30g from the guy he DEed for). People were making 75g per heroic with this loot system. the new LFG option killed off that avanue, and it will do the same for seasonal bosses.<br />
<br />
Also people might only want the mount on their main toon, so they summon the boss on their alt, for the group to have a full 5 summons, then bring in their main toon for the groups summons. This new LFG option will kill that off also. <br />
<br />
I don't mind carrying people if they make it worth my time. Players that were to low to summon, but wanted the achivment, or wanted the necks from the Valentines day boss, I would let them come in for a 100g fee. I see this LFG option hurting that revenue and helpful service.<br />

I'm making 150g / day on one gem transmute if I don't proc transmute master.<br />

If the cd was removed, you'd be transmuting for a profit of mats-&gt;gem of something like 5g if lucky and would have do alot more AH work just to break even.<br />

CC isnt the biggest problem agreed but survivability is crap as a boomkin, even you gotta admit that.<br />
<br />
Spriests need work too... I've never said that they don't have i?<br />
<br />
Pretty much all other casters have alot of cc, snare that Boomkins do not have... &quot;Yeey typhoon daze&quot;. You cannot dps ur target while he is in cyclone and roots break from dmg. I do not think this is super fair.<br />
<br />
Affli locks cant heal? Ele shamans can run in their travel form w/o taking more dmg(And snare/heal)... Something we cannot do because a moonkin w/o moonkin form is a dead moonkin.<br />
<br />
Mages have so much absorb, kite, cc, even a ability that makes them immune...blink.. <br />
<br />
Barkskin would not fix the problem, moonkin form needs to be buffed. A passive dmg reduce effect.<br />
<br />
Your argument that &quot;Team fails, blame class&quot; is idiotic. If we were talking about a warrior then yes but Boomkins are the crappiest spec on PvP atm(Well enha comes pretty close too).</div></div><hr />

Yes, it was nice to make a few extra gold each day if you find someone willing to buy your cooldown (which on my server they do instead of buying a already crafted mat for way more than the required materials + 30g). But at the same time titansteel bars still have STUPID prices on them because no one bothers to put them on AH and if I go get the mats I might as well transmute the shit myself over 4 characters (I have 2 miners and my brother has 2 miners).<br />
Now I wont have to relog like a idiot anymore and anyone who needs a few bars smelted will still pay a small fee for the work... As for tailoring being a low profit profession: LEG ENCHANTS? The mats for these are STUPID cheap (well, frozen orbs just rocketed in price :P) and everyone needs them all the time (especially non-cloth hybrids who don't have tailoring most of the time, make those more!).<br />
Just saying that the people who should be complaining are blacksmiths, as they only make weapon chains and eternal belt buckles that most ppl need (everyone in case of the latter) but the mats are stupid cheap (especially after the alchemy titanium transmute cooldown removal) and go for VERY little on AH. Yet I personally have no problems with it :\<br />
The only profession who's more screwed than BS is engi without ashen verdict rep...<br />
<br />
Also, alchemists... I agree, separate cooldowns on eternal and gem transmute would be nice, but removal is just plainly retarded... Think about it for a few seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I can understand how it hurts a little less to lose the mount to a guildie than from some random from trade chat, I lost my faith in guild /roll systems when guildies with 1 level 80 were asking you to bring all 5 of your level 80s for the group (helping them more than you). <br />
<br />
A specific example that still bothers me was last years' guild halloween boss run, were a guildie went afk for the summon, but came back just in time to need roll on the mount and win. Not sure how he justified being afk for the whole fight, but getting the one desireable item from him. <br />
<br />
I now use the GDKP model so no matter what drops, every player is better off, and no one player gets all the loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Elemental damage should be in a pretty good place now if you don't drop ToW, so really I think the only risk is if you're in a guild that won't take you because they get a slightly higher buff from their Demo lock and can't afford to bring you both. I'm a little skeptical that that situation happens too frequently based on the number of Elementals we actually see in dungeons and raids. If it happens to you, I apologize (and you don't need to post 'it happens to me!&quot; in this thread) but you might want to sit down with your raid leaders and discuss if the difference is really as great as they think it is.<br />
<br />
I think it is pretty retarted that when i drop ToW i lose almost 2500 dps. It's the same as letting DK's not use gargoyle and ghouls because they have to buff the raid. And on top of that ToW gives a lot less sp then DP. <br />
<br />
It just shouldn't be like this. Elemental damage should be in a pretty good place now IF you don't drop ToW. It's like saying: DK dps is in a pretty good place now IF you use gargoyle...</div></div><hr />

On My server the titansteel sells on AH for less than mats. Also the mats for leg enchants cost 190g and the AH price is 200g so after Ah takes its 5% you are only making 5g and that is if you sell it the first day. If it doesn't sell you are losing gold from the posting fees.</div></div><hr />

2) Eclipse. The issue isn't that it does too much damage. The reason Eclipse got buffed is because Balance Druids aren't doing enough, and as we go further into ICC, things haven't changed because Eclipse isn't the issue, it's the RNG. It isn't too powerful, even when we get to stand in one place for the most part, kind of like Festergut, we pretty much break even. We move, and it's massive loss.<br />

Queue as a group with your friends. Now you don't have to run to the dungeon to do it.<br />

<br />
But there are all kinds of unknowns. You *have* to have five people, the way the dungeon finder currently works. The apothecary trio could easily be 4-manned (and even 3-manned and difficultly 2-manned). What if you don't want to take a 5th person? Will they force the 75-80 range for the boss, or will they allow people of any level to queue to come in for the achievement (we took a level 30 with us from my guild to help her get the boss kill achievement for Love is in the Air). Will you be allowed to queue if you have already used your summon for the day? How will swapping alt toons in and out for their summons and keeping 3-4 people the same work? Will the loot system function the same as it does currently? If you have people from other servers coming in using the dungeon finder, will you still be able to pay people off not to roll? And conveniently of course, the holiday is over, and there's no boss to test it with on the PTR from here on out. Convenient.<br />
<br />
I prefer to run with close friends or people from my guild for these kinds of events because there will be less bitterness and griping, and, I'll be honest, I know who I can bribe not to roll or who will take a substantial amount of gold if they win the roll.<br />
<br />
Why take away the ability to walk into the instance and do it the old-fashioned way? They didn't do that with the dungeons themselves. You can go three man heroic Utgarde Pinnacle for an uncontested shot at the mount if you want. Why can't you three man holiday bosses for an uncontested shot at the mount? On top of making the drop rates garbage for the love rocket, they want to make sure you have a high probability to lose it to a random stranger, too?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding alchemy transmutes, I don't mind the cooldown on epic gems, but their sharing that cooldown with the elemental transmutations is total BS.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think all of the elemental transmutations should be on different cooldowns (if they're on one to begin with) based on when they became available in the game. One cooldown for basic elements (classic), one for primals (Burning Crusade), and one for eternals (WotLK). Also, the cooldown for elements should be set at 12 hours, so you can do two a day. The prices on all of the elemental materials (apart from the ones needed to make gems) are for the most part already crap on the AH now anyway, so it's not like it would kill anybody financially.</div></div><hr />

On my server Titanium Ore sells for 7-15g per, and Titanium bars only sell for about 8-16g per. Given that it's 2 ore per bar, (partially from xmutes and partially from less demand for bars) it makes a great deal of sense for me to farm ore, sell it and buy bars to xmute into titansteel. <br />
<br />
If you base on the ore price, the value of a titansteel is lower than mats, but on the bar price there's a significant profit to be made. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm conflicted about this and I'm of the opinion that people whining about alchemists not having their xmutes cooldowns removed aren't thinking the situation through. <br />
<br />
The cooldown on a transmute is precisely what limits the supply of the transmuted good, and makes the price higher. <br />
<br />
If you remove the cooldown on a transmute, the market and AH arbitrage will drive the price of the final product down to a near zero margin over the component materials. By removing the cooldown they made your ability to smelt titansteel essentially worthless except for your own use. You'll only be able to get a percent or two of profit and AH fees will eat that up. <br />
<br />
The benefit is that it will drive prices lower on the finished goods (but it may also drive prices higher on the mats). Making it somewhat cheaper to make things overall. <br />
<br />
If they were to do this with epic gems, the price of an epic gem and a blue gem would come very close together. AH arbitrage traders would just buy blues and xmute them where there was any profit to be made. It would probably make saronite more expensive, and titanium less expensive. But you would also not be able to make any significant profit on your xmutes after the change. <br />
<br />
I don't particularly like this because I'm busy, (I've worked over 70 hours this week.) I still try to raid when I can, but I rely on the xmutes from my miners and my alchemist to make me enough money for repairs and flasks. I don't have much time to run dailies or farm otherwise. Without that, it just got a lot tougher to make money. <br />
<br />
But I also see it as laying the way for cataclysm. Having xmute cooldowns on WoTLK goods when you're primarily deailing with Cataclsm goods would be unnecessary.</div></div><hr />

Most seasonal items are rubish, yes. However, some seasonal events like Hallow's End, have a chance at a mount drop. I'd much rather keep a mount roll like between my guild than so much as one random idiot. <br />

I don't believe Samm cares for actual drops like necklaces from the Valentine's Day boss that are completely the same as the Emblem of Conquest necklaces, but cares more for the shot at the Love Rocket mount.

We do, however, have the prerogative to choose who we do and do not group with - or DID - for holiday events. We could choose to go in with 2, 3, or 4 people instead of 5, or take 5 guildies and switch alts out for more summons for people who actually care about the mounts and pets. They're taking away the freedom that we had to say we didn't want to go with random people who would ninjaloot or take an item that they don't really care about winning simply because they got to roll on it.<br />
<br />
Is this really the direction you want Blizzard going? Imagine if they decided to force all dungeons to work in this manner, and raids. Imagine not being able to go in and 8 man Naxx and instead being forced to take two random people with you, and not being able to master loot. I don't want it for raids, I certainly don't want it for optional holiday bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hots are only good in tree form. NO one is really complaining that restoration druids can't PvP. Immunity to polymorph only exists in forms. That means you can only heal yourself without being polymorphed while doing so if you are in tree form. Again, no one is really complaining that restoration druids can't PvP. I have no clue where you got the idea that druids are &quot;impervious to roots&quot; since the only way you can get out of roots if they are continually cast is to continue shape shifting until you are either away from the person casting roots or dead. They can actually dash, not sprint, and what does a 2.5 second cool down (if glyphed) that requires you to go into cat form (which is a FERAL form) have to do with being balance, and by the way, no one is really complaining that feral druids can't PvP either. Stealth can only be gone into in cat form, which is a feral form, and as I have said, NO one is complaining that feral druids can't PvP. I think all you have proven in this entire post is that if you want to PvP on a druid then roll either restoration or feral. However, some people actually enjoy playing a subpar caster that can't stand up to a real caster in 99.9% of all given situations.<br />

<br />
Dungeon finder =/= random group<br />
<br />
<br />
Except the discussion is currently centering around using 3 or 4 members since the problem is a necessity to use the tool. Everyone would be thrilled if you &quot;could&quot; use the tool to do holiday bosses since this would be an instant teleport, akin to doing random or specific dungeons via the tool currently in a group simply negating travel times. If, however, we want to four man say regular Halls of Reflection for a shield for the alt tank of a guildmate, we can fly there, summon, and run as desired. If we had to queue via dungeon finder we would not have been to reset after Marwyn and may risk, even if people are generally nice about this, losing the shield on a roll when there is no reason to.<br />
<br />
The same problem occurs with seasonal bosses but is amplified by additional attempts on alts and extra rare drops. Sure, I do not care about mounts or pets, but friends do (just handed the black drake from 3d10 to a friend after I won the roll), and I care about wasting our time or frustrating them by letting a random, unnecessary fifth into the group to potentially win<br />
<br />
However, a further problem comes because while I do not want a fifth potentially getting those rare drops, I am not actually a jerk. I would feel uncomfortable changing the loot options (of course I cannot, but I mean as a for instance), telling them outright they cannot (as though this would do anything), or, the actual problem, cycling in alts to give the fifth fewer attempts since the mains still in group had already done. The solution would be if you cannot start an attempt you cannot queue, which is stupid.<br />
<br />
Requiring the tool is unnecessary and only creates problems. Sure, I would like to have not have had to run to SFK daily, but I will gladly make that trek for the certainty of handing the rocket to the person I want too.</div></div><hr />

I really hate to break this to you, but Blizzard DETESTS when 2 people can do content designed for 5 people. In the past that normally results in either an uber buff to the content or an uber nerf to the classes that can pull it off. If you want to go 2/3/4 man an entire game then go play DAOC.<br />

Actually, I wouldn't mind if Blizzard did force you to take two randoms. The &quot;my guild is better than your guild&quot; crap that goes on in this game does nothing other than destroy what little &quot;community&quot; there actually is in this game.

<br />
Well then, be sure to tell Blizzard to remove the achievement that requires completing Naxx with less than nine people. They already encourage overgeared guilds to go into raids with fewer members than are necessary. And my guild is by no means high level progression. I have nothing against taking people to things in general. I'm a very patient person in random heroics when it comes to low gear scores and DPS and people being fresh 80s. I'm usually the one encouraging my guild leader to take people from LFR or trade chat when we're trying to fill raid slots instead of just cherrypicking off his friend's list and giving up on the raid when there's no one there. I have a problem with Blizzard *telling* me I have to take that many people.<br />
<br />
It's not my fault that we outgeared Coren Direbrew or the Headless Horseman or the Apothecary Trio. Blame Blizzard. They're the ones who designed the encounters. Though, on a fun side note, the first night, the people dying first in our Apothecary group were the highest geared raiders. They couldn't get a handle on the neutralizers. I don't speak for just myself though when I say that at times during this holiday, on lower population servers, it would be very difficult to even FIND two more people to go if you needed 5. A few nights, we four manned it because there were no alliance people on trade who wanted to go, and there was no one waiting at the stone begging to be taken like they did for Ahune. My 2-man reference came from the Headless Horseman, when a friend and I two-manned it in a desperate attempt after our tank got disconnected right before a summon. And the mount dropped on that attempt, so I felt oddly rewarded and proud of the fact that I got it while 2-manning it.<br />
<br />
But yes, when it comes to rare mounts, I'm selfish, and I want a less contested shot at them. I'll be blunt. And given that it's an optional holiday boss, and not progression content, I don't see the need to force people to fight over such things, especially when they have such a low drop rate. If the drop rates were better, like Direbrew and the ram and kodo (which I think were around 5%?) then the rocket and headless horseman's mount wouldn't be so bad to go with strangers. When you know you'll be lucky to see it maybe once that whole event, and mount collecting is one of the primary things that you do in the game, you want to stack the deck in your favor with friendly faces as much as possible.</div></div><hr />

hello i have a question about this. what if 4 people you dont know queue together and they want a specific item that you want too. so they just kick you even though the reason is not nice. does your debuff get removed, or do you get another 15 minute debuff, or what happens do you think?<br />

So this time you don't get kicked just before the boss where your items drops (usually last), but you can just requeue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with the idea to give separate CDs for gems and eternals, however there doesn't need to be infinite eternals with no cool downs. They could take it off cooldown, and get rid of the proc chance like what they did for potion / elixer specs in BC. When WOTLK was released, elixer and potion spec alchamists could still make BC flasks but they would no longer proc to make extras. However, if a tranmute spec turns a primal earth into a primal water their WOLK eternal and gem cooldowns are also consumed. They could simply make it not proc extras, but take it off cooldown when Cataclsym is released.</div></div><hr />

Vote kick reason in 3.3.3<br />
This might not answer your question -- which may or may not have been rhetorical anyway -- but we did find that a lot people were clicking &quot;Yes&quot; on the Vote Kick alert, then later asking, &quot;why did we kick that guy?&quot; The idea is to make the person who wants to kick someone from the group give everyone else a reason. If the reason is silly or defamatory, a surprising number of people could very well reject it.<br />
<br />
While many people are quick to take into account all of the worst possible scenarios with any presented changes to the game, we find that those cases are typically the minor fringe cases once the changes are put in action. The patch notes are out and the speculation is brimming, but let's see how things turn out before clenching our crystal balls, shall we?

Will the 2x cloth creation still exist? As has been stated several times already the removal of the cloth and mining CD's says Cata is just around the corner so I dont care about the loss of some gold, I make enough just randoming as a tank or healer and with what little life I have Id forget to log onto my tailor every 4 days to do these and get her the last 6 points to 450. Though I wish I could go back in time about a month and tell myself not to vendor off the 20 odd stacks of frozen orbs in my bank. &quot;Never gonna need these things, oh they vendor for 100g a stack, awesome.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Yes, you still get 2 of the cloths that you are speced into, assuming they do the same way they did in the BC to WOTLK transition.</div></div><hr />

[b]Random dungeon 15 minute vote kick limit gone in 3.3.3<br />
It's not mentioned in the notes, but the Vote Kick option no longer has a 15-minute cooldown. Enjoy. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23329213478-did-we-hurt-the-devs-feelings.html))<br />

Vote kick reason in 3.3.3<br />
This might not answer your question -- which may or may not have been rhetorical anyway -- but we did find that a lot people were clicking &quot;Yes&quot; on the Vote Kick alert, then later asking, &quot;why did we kick that guy?&quot; The idea is to make the person who wants to kick someone from the group give everyone else a reason. If the reason is silly or defamatory, a surprising number of people could very well reject it.<br />
<br />
While many people are quick to take into account all of the worst possible scenarios with any presented changes to the game, we find that those cases are typically the minor fringe cases once the changes are put in action. The patch notes are out and the speculation is brimming, but let's see how things turn out before clenching our crystal balls, shall we?

While this is a step in the right direction this doesn't actually help anyone.... the people being kicked NEED to see the reason, if you don't know what you've done wrong, your never going to improve.</div></div><hr />

My main and alt does around 7-7.5k in heroics (my alt does more since she is a rogue, but ya) and I have been praised, not kicked. I can see kicking someone that does 1000 dps (have seen this), and they should be rightfully so</div></div><hr />

He's a &quot;Baddie&quot; because he doesnt know? You're a tool.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bowen</div><div class="date">2010-02-28, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically baddies and undergeareds will be replaced by epeen douches who think it will be funny to kick someone for no reason, though giving a false or stupid reason. Blizz will have to crack down on this and do some 72 hour type bans or this will get out of control.<br />
<br />
Because carrying dps with full 232/245 welfare epics that can't pull over 2.5k and gets flawed by the tank who is rage starved for half of the instance, or even that player who thinks it is acceptable to arrive in ungemed gear, this is fun yes .... hardly.</div></div><hr />
