<br />
Magni Essence Quest Chain<br />
Th PTR currently lets you start an epic quest chain to unlock your first essence and upgrade it all the way to max rank!<br />
<br />
<br />
An Earthen Guardian in your capitol city gives you the quest &quot;Essential Empowerment&quot; to meet Magni in The Chamber of Heart.<br />
There, Magni tells you MOTHER has finished her calculations. Upon talking to her, there is a placeholder cutscene and she tells you to seek out essences to power up the Heart of Azeroth, the first being a dragon essence in Neltharion's Lair in Highmountain.<br />
You meet with Spiritwalker Ebonhorn outside, who says that the essence must be an echo of the power of the dragonflights, and has Navarogg tunnel you inside.<br />
There we must quell the elements by sealing 4 ruptures. Ebonhorn then sense that the essence is being held by a rock elemental giant. We confront him for the essence, but he wants us to prove ourselves in combat first.<br />
He relinquishes the essence when defeated, and Ebonhorn requests to accompany you to the Chamber of Heart to offer his expertise.<br />
Magni is introduced to the Tauren before telling you to meet him at Nordrassil in Hyjal. This grants you the rank 1 essence.<br />
At this point Kalecgos is also inside the Chamber of Heart and says the Emerald Dream is being invaded by the void. He tells you to meet Merithra the green dragon at the Temple of Elune in Val'sharah.<br />
Heading to Hyjal first, the area under Nordrassil has become overrun with Azerite elementals. Once you cleanse the area of the creatures, a giant Azerite Leviathan shows up in the lake that needs to be defeated. Magni remarks that the Heart of Azeroth is meant to heal, not hurt and then tells you to return to the Heart Chamber.<br />
Magni then says another problem has occurred at the Maelstrom and has MOTHER teleport you there.<br />
The Maelstrom has been overrun much like Nordrassil. You have to cleanse this area as well and then defeat an Azerite giant that the shamans have been trying to quell.<br />
Kalecgos's quest has you head to Val'sharah. When you meet up with Merithra, she takes you into the Emerald Dream where you must collect emerald essences, destroy void creatures, and try to wake green dragons succumbing to the void. It seems like the void creatures are sucking the life from the dragons, and some cannot wake up at all. You eventually go deeper into the Emerald Dream.<br />
Here, you must destroy 3 giant void tentacles to bring out a void terror. After killing it, you begin the ritual to cleanse the dragon essence from Neltharion's Lair and receive rank 2 of the essence. You are then tasked to bring it back to the Chamber of Heart, where Merithra will be waiting.<br />
<br />
Note: There is a chest on the map inside a cave here that has void tendrils. Upon clicking the, you receive an item called &quot;Remnant of the Void. The tooltip says &quot;Drops of Void linger on the petals.&quot; It is unknown what this is used for as of now.<br />
<br />
At the Heart Chamber, Kalecgos says he hasn't heard from Alexstraza in the Twilight Highlands after reaching out to the other Dragonflights, so he has you meet him there to investigate.<br />
Kalecgos was unable to make it fully to the Vermilion Redoubt as something is keeping them out of the sky. You then enter a scenario where you have to fend off void-twisted drakes to reach Alexstraza while Kalecgos flies above, freezing enemies periodically so they take additional damage.<br />
When you reach Alexstraza, her and Kalecgos fight off the lead twilight drake, Vexiona, as she taunts them to submit. On the ground, you rescue 5 red dragons. Vexiona wants to unite all dragonflights as twilight drakes, but obviously that doesn't go over well. Alexstraza chases her and you meet up with Kalacgos and fly with him to confront the twilight drake.<br />
The two aspects are subdued by corruptors that you have to kill in order for them and have Kalecgos freeze Vaxiona. Alexstraza says that the aspects will defend Azeroth to their dying breath, and Vexiona flees before we can kill her, saying that she will find others who will join her cause.<br />
You take the Lost Scale of the Scarlet Broodmother and meet Alexstraza back the Chamber of Heart. This gives you rank 3 of the essence.<br />
Kalecgos then tells you that he found a remnant of his flight's power, and it can be used by Magni to give you the rank 4 legendary version of the essence that you have been upgrading, which gives you a cosmetic animation for the ability. As of now there is an &quot;awesome in-game cutscene that is missing.&quot;<br />
The Essence is The Crucible of Flame, which has a major ability that does damage or healing when used, doubling with each cast until it is used 3x, in which it resets. It has two chargers and each cast also increases your critical strike for 5 seconds, which is similar to the minor passive that gives your abilities the chance to increase your critical strike. The animation hurls a ball of Azerite at the target.<br />

<br />
If you can keep 19 toons &quot;viable&quot; (I'm assuming for Pug raiding, at bare minimum, because...lolWQs), you're already spending a lot of time on them. What's some more?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Players: &quot;these story quest chains are too short!&quot;<br />
Also players: &quot;these story quest chains are too long for my 800 alts&quot;<br />
<br />
No pleasing you people. You honestly think the 10 ilvl 5 min quest chain in Nazmir was a &quot;long ass quest chain?&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you will have 19 alts at lvl50 neck then this quest will be an absolute joke by comparison.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is that a problem? Maintaining 19 toons means you barely have a life, so it really doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />

We never actually killed Sin in the Bastion of Twilight but Zeryxia said she followed instructions from &quot;beyond the grave&quot; or something to that effect but maybe it was from another source given their affiliation to the Void...</div></div><hr />

Keeping 19 toons &quot;viable&quot;?? Jesus christ... I hate the game just playing 1.</div></div><hr />

And yeah, these questchains are too long even for the FIRST time. I've completely stopped doing the war campaign questlines on all my alts after unlocking the WQs, that's how bad they are.<br />

I completely disagree. I'm old, I've been playing since launch and my first several characters were Horde. Thrall was a great character until they went full Mary Sue with him, and almost his entire &quot;retirement&quot; seems to have been driven by them just not knowing what to do with the character. To have him return like this is fitting. The Horde is not evil. It would be easy to think that now with the shallow heavy handed writing in BfA, but the Horde is about strength and, more importantly, honor. The Horde as it exists now is unrecognizable from the Horde of old. In fact, it could be argued that it's harsher now than it ever was under Garrosh. Most of the Forsaken would likely be fine with Sylvanas's actions, she is their Queen and all, some of the more bloodthirsty Orcs may also be on board, and the Goblins are going to go with the gold, but it's ridiculous to believe the rest of the races would not be in full out rebellion by now. To think they would not have banded together to protect the honor of the Horde is unthinkable. If there was ever a time for Thrall to return, it's now, when Baine is about to be executed for the crime of acting with honor and the Horde he left in the hands of others has been twisted and corrupted into something else entirely. This is no longer the Horde, this is Sylvanas's personal death squad, and there's no way it couldn't have boiled over at some point. <br />
<br />
If you like being evil, that's fine. That's a neat option in many games. This is a great time to be a Forsaken. But if you think not allowing the Horde to stay on the path of just outright being the bad guys means the story is written for 12 year olds, I'd have to suggest a look in the mirror.</div></div><hr />
