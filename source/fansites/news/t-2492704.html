Face Queen Azshara’s most devoted champions in an epic new raid—The Eternal Palace.<br />
<br />
Ten thousand years ago, as the seas engulfed Zin-Azshari, Queen Azshara forged a dark bargain with N’Zoth that transformed her loyal subjects into the sinister naga. Through millennia of brutal conquest, Azshara has built a new empire from the ruins of the old and now holds dominion over the depths that once threatened to claim her. Ever the gracious host, she has invited the Alliance and Horde alike into her eternal palace to witness her glorious ascension… and their ultimate demise.<br />

<br />
Blackwater Behemoth<br />
Summoned from depths unknown, the Blackwater Behemoth lurks in an abyss so dark that not even the naga dare to venture into it. Only Azshara is capable of taming the beast, and she has trained it to faithfully guard her treasures.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Radiance of Azshara<br />
Using her handmaiden as a willing sacrifice, Azshara has forged into being an elemental of storm and arcana. Powered by the soul of the devoted vassal, the resulting monstrosity is the avatar of Azshara’s radiance.<br />
<br />

Lady Ashvane<br />
Priscilla Ashvane’s relentless pursuit of power has ultimately led her to the Eternal Palace and into a dark pact with Queen Azshara. But what Ashvane receives in return for her loyalty may be more than she bargained for.<br />
<br />

<br />
Orgozoa<br />
Orgozoa tends to Azshara’s hatchery, preparing for the day her incubating horrors are unleashed upon Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/june/thumb/epr05.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/june/epr05.jpg) <br />
<br />
The Queen’s Court<br />
For ten thousand years, the Queen’s Court has never failed to enforce the word of Azshara. Now, the queen’s most powerful servants stand ready to fulfill her final decree.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/june/thumb/epr06.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/june/epr06.jpg) <br />
<br />
Za’qul, Harbinger of Ny’alotha<br />
The harbinger for the end of days, Za’qul shreds the last vestiges of sanity from a world in chaos, laying the foundations for Azeroth’s new master.<br />
<br />

<br />
Queen Azshara<br />
Queen of the Naga, Empress of Nazjatar, and one of the most powerful entities Azeroth has ever known, Azshara has plotted and schemed for millennia in preparation for this fateful moment. Now, with all the pieces in place, the time has finally come to reveal her endgame.<br />

<br />
Consistency died in lore...and while we love new things, I certainly dont like that past lore means little or nothing and isnt a feature of the present..what is to draw people to explore past games, material and stuff if nothing of the new stuff is connected to its origin?<br />
I would have had written a book on Azshara that revealed the person she was before her rise to empress and how it changed everything.<br />
<br />
I expected so much more on the lore front for this character, this zone, and these encounters - I guess BFA continues to astonish in failing to match expectations, yet 8.2, while hailed as a great comeback, pleases in every department but lore - the one I hold most dear, for the race I hold most dear.<br />

Ah well, thank you, NEXt.</div></div><hr />

No, she escapes after the raid. She won't die until next expansion when Thrall tracks her down after escaping with a rogue bronze dragon to an alternate timeline. As is tradition.</div></div><hr />

You cracked the code, tier sets died because there is no class design!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalarm</div><div class="date">2019-06-19, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You cracked the code, tier sets died because there is no class design!<br />
<br />
I think that's an overstatement. There is no reason for them to be this ugly simply because they aren't linked to any classes. The halls of valor sets were very cool and simply raid focused. They could of made some very cool stuff based on the lore. I would of loved emerald nightmare inspired sets... the problem is they seem to have cut TOO much ressources into the making of them. I don't know if it's because they cut too much staff proportionally to the amount of sets they wouldn't need to do or if it's simply because the team made a LOT of brain storming and that is how they came up with really good stuff but now it's just 2-3 guys doing it all and not many good ideas are thrown in because of that.<br />
<br />
But they ARE ugly. I think BFA sets have been the first time I felt so let down upon seeing tier sets. Maybe it's because my main (before I quit) is a shaman and we got the guy that was making the hunter sets instead of the shaman sets but... I don't want to really farm any of them once I reach 9.0 max level... I did see some of them that were pretty darn cool... but those ones... ugh :-/</div></div><hr />

If that wasn't for the dress, I wouldn't be able to identify the cloth one. Then no idea about which ones are the Mail, Plate and Leather set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They might come faster back than you think: removing class sets was a big fiasco, not only gameplay wise, but also financial. They thought that removing them will save them money, but by removing them, replayability of raids got removed too, and that also cost them money, far more than they probably thought.<br />
<br />
So i expect class sets to return at least in the next xpack. Sadly this expansion the crappy &quot;raid sets&quot; will stay around.</div></div><hr />

If that got under your skin, I can only imagine the rage an analogy would send you into.</div></div><hr />

We pay a subscription fee -- that has, if anything, gone up over the years -- so that they can design less tier sets, less unique tier sets, sets that are merely 'not bad, but nothing special either'. Why should gear that drops in the pinnacle of WoW's content (raids) be anything short of the pinnacle of their gear design?</div></div><hr />

<br />
All true, except for the part where the subscription fee has gone up.. lol. It has remained the same price, but in fact, it is quite a bit cheaper than it was in the past due to inflation.</div></div><hr />
