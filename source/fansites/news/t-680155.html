Don't get me wrong, I love you, and I'm a proud owner of a: DON'T BE A FOOLZ STAY IN SCHOOLZ t-shirt...but this whole mohawk grenade this is really starting to creep on my nerves. Although I won't lie, a shanter bomb would be awesome, and appease my inner trekkie ;D</div></div><hr />

I will say though that while the T-head is fairly well done on most races, the Tauren version looks AWFUL. Looks like some kind of giant distorted mask of ugly. Needless to say I make a point of hitting Taurens with the grenade whenever possible :-)</div></div><hr />

Personally, I love them. There's worse ways you could be advertising.<br />
And honestly? Part of their target audience is the group that grew up watching Mr. T during his prime days. They'd be in their mid-30 to early 40s about now. What makes them any different from someone in their 20s when it comes to choice of games?</div></div><hr />

Personally, I love them. There's worse ways you could be advertising.<br />
And honestly? Part of their target audience is the group that grew up watching Mr. T during his prime days. They'd be in their mid-30 to early 40s about now. What makes them any different from someone in their 20s when it comes to choice of games?<br />
<br />
<br />
what you said makes good sense on the target <br />
<br />
honestly they should try getting Chuck Norris and Magnum P.I and possible some Nickelodeon live action actor to bring in more of a younger crowd at the same time<br />
<br />
its just money they want :P<br />
<br />
o god heh if they could get someone from twilight it be an epidemic XD</div></div><hr />

I'm in that target audience. 35 years old. Personally I don't see the Mr. T adds doing much for sales among my age group. I don't object to them, or think they're awful or anything (I even found the first one pretty damned amusing), but if I wasn't already playing I don't see them pulling me in. Like I said in my post, I like the guy (in so far as it is possible to &quot;like&quot; someone I only know through his celebrity), and I'm happy he's able to make a few bucks hawking WoW. He's had a tough couple of decades, but despite that he seems genuinely kind and tries to be a good role model. I just don't personally see where this campaign will make Blizzard much money. On the other hand, like I said, they seem to have a better handle on what sells than I do. I haven't marketed any phenomenally successful MMORPGs lately.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harcon</div><div class="date">2009-11-23, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the difference between Blizzard marketing and most of the anti-MR T advert people in this thread.<br />
<br />
Blizz does not care if you dont like it - You already got warcraft! As soon as you relise that this is a targeted advert the better.<br />
<br />
That is why blizzard has the most sucessful game in history and the biggist MMO ever. 12 million subscribers is like a billion turnover. From 1 game. And that game is growing every day in a intrustry where every MMo looses total subscribers after its first year (only exception is eve-online and wow obviously)<br />
<br />
Thats why Blizzard are makking hundreds of millions and you guys are only capable of writing in a forum - if you guys were in charge of marketing, you would end up becoming a marketing disaster just like almost every other MMO out there.<br />
<br />
Blizzard aim at people new to MMO's. The MMO's aim at gamers. And there are more non-mmo people than gamers. Understand basic marketing and you will relise that Blizz's marketing campaigns are genius</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not really. The ad is not aimed at you, the wow player who posts on internet forums.<br />
<br />
The advert is aimed at &quot;normal&quot; people who do not have wow and watch tv. There are tens of millions of those people who would play wow and become the new set of customers 3-6 months from now.<br />
<br />
Thats why blizz's marketing dept is targeting them now. In fact, blizz is the only company targeting &quot;normal&quot; people with mainstream marketing.<br />
<br />
Please note, by normal people, I do not mean the 0.5% who play online games enough to care about posting in a forums. I am talking about joe average and his buddies who might play pool, drink a beer, watch football etc etc</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you had seen the A-team and rocky III in its prime you would hear all the &quot;shaddap foo&quot; comments towards your posts. The first Mr T commercial was great, this one is fun aswell. <br />
<br />
But as already stated, if you had been 10 years older you would have known the glory of Mr. T. Hearing him keep ranting about his hair and bling bling is nostalgic and thus awesome. And it certainly has a different target group than 15 year olds who has WoW forums as startup page and know every word in every WoW commercial so far. Whats the point in making commercial for already paying customers? There you go, business 101.<br />
