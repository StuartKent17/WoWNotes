I got a crazy amount of mails from players concerned about the digital download version of Cataclysm. Someone pointed out that a post on the customer support forum (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=27189094900&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1#19) mentions that pre-rendered cinematic are not part of the digital download anymore. <br />
<br />
I usually do not comment that kind of stuff, but I would like to point out that people are going crazy over a post made 2 weeks before the sale of the Cataclysm digital download started and things are very different in this case. There aren't any official confirmations that the cinematics will not be part of the Cataclysm digital download and I strongly suggest that you all wait for a blue reply, I really don't see Blizzard slapping a huge % of their playerbase in the face by not including cinematics in the Cataclysm client. <br />
<br />
This is most likely just a bug and we will probably have an official post about that very soon. <br />

Cataclysm Models - Therazane<br />
I forgot to post this model a while back, Therazane the Stonemother (http://www.wowpedia.org/Therazane) got her own unique model in Cataclysm and it's ridiculously awesome.<br />

Cataclysm - Capital Cities Quartermasters<br />
With the expansion, Capital Cities will finally have their own quartermasters and rewards! Don't get too excited, they're only low level rewards, but some of you will probably like the idea of having a set of tabard/cloak with the emblem of your faction. <br />
<br />
Each quartermaster offers:<br />
<br />
A faction tabard, these tabards finally allow you to level your capital cities reputations in instances. (eg. Darnassus Tabard (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/45579/darnassus-tabard/))<br />
3 Low level cloaks (eg. Cape of Darnassus (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/64887/cape-of-darnassus/), Mantle of Darnassus (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/64888/mantle-of-darnassus/), Shroud of Darnassus (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/64886/shroud-of-darnassus/))<br />
A 16-slot bag (eg. Darnassian Satchel (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/67526/darnassian-satchel/))<br />

Armor Penetration<br />
Armor penetration as a concept is not overpowered. We're not worried about Sunder Armor for example. Armor penetration as a stat was overpowered. There was no reasonable mathematical way for us to prevent armor pen rating on gear from just being better and better the more you stack, which has a number of problems, such as making other stats unattractive and making a dude with a lot of armor pen overpowered.

<br />
PvP Damage<br />
Some of those numbers have already come down. If you recall, Fury dps was low with the patch, so we buffed it, knowing that we would have to nerf it again to keep it under control at 85, especially with Colossus Smash and Deep Wounds. Ret had a similar issue with Inquisition.<br />
<br />
We definitely want to increase survival time in PvP relative to what it was in Lich King. We are considering increasing resilience at 85 or even bumping health pools across the board even more.

Vanish in Cataclysm<br />
The purpose of Vanish in Cataclysm is to get back into stealth. If you want to avoid harmful effects, use Cloak of Shadows.<br />
<br />
We grew tired, as did many players, of &quot;Vanish never works LOL&quot; so we looped back to the original intent of Vanish being about stealth. That is why the tooltip specifically says that harmful effects won't break Vanish, but does *not* say that the harmful effects won't land. We understand some rogues liked using Vanish to &quot;dodge spells&quot; but the ability was never designed to work that way and never was going to work that way very well. The more we tried to let it be a damage negater, the harder time we had letting it guarantee stealth.<br />
<br />
There is a current live bug with pets and guardians being able to still target a vanished rouge. That will be fixed in an upcoming patch. Other than that, we are not aware of any issues that keep the ability from working as advertised. Most concerns seems to be rogues who want it to work a different way.

Colossus Smash<br />
The origin behind Colossus Smash was that we realized warriors were at a disadvantage against heavily armored targets because they do no magic damage. We also wanted to put something in their rotation that was more than just another +weapon damage or +AP attack. Finally, we wanted to replace Execute in the Sudden Death talent, since that was keeping Execute's damage low, instead of it feeling like a powerful finisher.

I suppose the problem with a &quot;play as we stream&quot; client is the cinematics would need to be downloaded either first or last, because you can't expect the client to just request the wrathgate file when you complete that quest and expect it to stream and play.</div></div><hr />

Read Boub's comment before posting.<br />

It's a rumor that cinematics will be removed from WoW, not a fact. Not to mention this is only in one release, which screams bug.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like a load of shit to me. I doubt even Activision is that stupid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Riiiiiigt.<br />
<br />
Kotick said specifically they planned to combine all the cutscenes from the game and sell them for the same price as a movie in ADDITION to still having them in-game.<br />
<br />
Also, it is Activision-Blizzard, stop calling them Activision as if the Activision half is in control or something. They're not. They're sister companies, not parent/son.</div></div><hr />

As a result they will start charging an extra amount, upwards of 20-30$ in order to include such cinematics in their games. It's over all a slap in the face for future games by Activision but I didn't expect the new policy to be included with WoW.<br />

Go into your WoW folder, and then into the Data folder and delete the folder called &quot;Cache&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's like 10 GB of unused installation files.<br />
<br />
With the entire Cataclysm pre-download, your WoW install should be just around 15 GB. My install is 14.7 GB.<br />
<br />
Oh, and that 14.7 GB is including some cinematics. I downloaded them from <br />
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=NPFF8J4G.<br />
<br />
Then, put them into: World of Warcraft\Data\enUS\Interface\Cinematics.</div></div><hr />

And they already stated that you need at least a certain amount of bandwidth to stream the client.<br />
I am sure that more than 90% of the people who will stream their client instead of fully download it have enough bandwidth to also download the cinematics.<br />
<br />
This is shortsightedness at it's best.<br />

Regarding the new quartermasters. Did anyone point already out the fact that the capes, which you can get at Exalted, require Level 35?

I don't know the stores where you buy, but the ones I know will have Cataclysm for the same amount (34,99€) including Amazon. Same price as the digital download.<br />

'Alrighty, so I just called Blizzard myself to see what was up with the in-game rendered cinematics. First of all the person who I talked to was completely confused by what I said. So it went something like this:<br />

Me: So if I do a quest that activated in-game rendered cinematics it will play the cinematic? with the digitally downloaded copy?<br />

&quot;If we were to take that hour, or hour and a half, take it out of the game, and we were to go to our audiences - for whom we have their credit card information and a direct relationship - and say to them, 'Would you like to have the StarCraft movie?'... and say we have this great hour and a half of linear video that we'd like to make available to you at a $30 or $20 price point, you'd have the biggest opening weekend of any film ever,<br />
<br />
<br />
step 1 - remove movies from game but make them `free` to youtube`<br />
<br />
when gamers have got use to buying the game without cinemtics, then<br />
<br />
step 2 - remove them from youtube and host them yourselves and then charge to watch them - because gamers are allready buying pets and items in game and will be used to having a game without the movies in allready. <br />

This is a bad theory. Also, in that quote, there is no confirmation they will actually remove them. Kotick may just mean &quot;take them out of the game&quot; as in &quot;take a copy&quot;. We don't know one way or the other.</div></div><hr />

What is it with making Earth Mother designs, yes I know she is considered the Stone Mother, absolutely ugly. Why would she even Float!

My theory is that it is just a rumor, and probably, like Boub and the European CM said - a bug.<br />
<br />
I'm sure Kotick is very greedy, but he has to be for the sake of the stockholders, that is the point. That said, he isn't going to cut ONLY the intro cinematic and try to make a movie out of one cinematic.<br />
<br />
A counter theory (but not one I endorse) is that they're cutting the cinematics to save bandwidth.</div></div><hr />

The sad thing is in this case Bobby cannot be blamed, as Blizzard did that already in the past.<br />
http://www.amazon.com/Blizzard-Entertainment-Collection-Warcraft-Starcraft-Pc/dp/B00006SG4T<br />
<br />
The difference might be - as no further facts have been revealed by Activision Blizzard - the aforementioned product has been sold besides the actual game containing the cinematics.<br />
I trust that Bobby would go so far as to completely take out this portion of the game and sell it separately instead of the approach taken by Blizzard back then.</div></div><hr />

Fair day all, <br />
<br />
Alright, so we've completed the investigation and it appears that from this point forward, the digital download will no longer include the game Pre-rendered Cinematics/Cutscenes as part of the download. As such the Wrath loading cinematic, Wrathgate, etc... will no longer be installed with the game when using the digital streaming download. This may change in the future(no promises, heh) however for right now they are not part of the digital download. [ Post edited by Lucasmcc ]<br />

EDIT: If Kotick tries to charge for ingame cinematics, he will see a very significant impact on his customers he thinks are so loyal. I'll likely remain playing WoW, but I sure as hell won't pay for a cinematic. There's just some things that cross the line of stupid.</div></div><hr />

Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has laid out plans to package the in-game cinematics from games like StarCraft and sell them as movies.<br />

<br />
Fair day all, <br />
<br />
Alright, so we've completed the investigation and it appears that from this point forward, the digital download will no longer include the game Pre-rendered Cinematics/Cutscenes as part of the download. As such the Wrath loading cinematic, Wrathgate, etc... will no longer be installed with the game when using the digital streaming download. This may change in the future(no promises, heh) however for right now they are not part of the digital download. [ Post edited by Lucasmcc ]<br />

Hi troll this is 1 week post back /shoo</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumps</div><div class="date">2010-11-01, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually do not comment that kind of stuff, but I would like to point out that people are going crazy over a post made 2 weeks before the sale of the Cataclysm digital download started and things are very different in this case.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why are they different? They made the date announcement of Cataclysm months ago - are you going to say that is not valid because its a long time ago?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There aren't any official confirmations that the cinematics will not be part of the Cataclysm digital download <br />
<br />
<br />
Yes there is, you just linked to it. Or can you explain to use which people working for blizzard we are supposed to ignore (and why)?<br />
<br />
<br />
and I strongly suggest that you all wait for a blue reply, I really don't see Blizzard slapping a huge % of their playerbase in the face by not including cinematics in the Cataclysm client.<br />
<br />
This is most likely just a bug and we will probably have an official post about that very soon. <br />
<br />
<br />
We have an official post. You linked to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, it's a rumor considering that post was weeks and weeks ago and a more recent post (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=15042105895&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=2#23) contradicts it completely.<br />
<br />
Its nonsense to suggest the time has anything to do with it - its even longer since they said Cataclysm would be out on the December 7th - are you going to say that's not true because its months since they said that?<br />
<br />
And that post doesn't contradict anything. A user said the installer had DELETED his cinematics he had from a DVD install, presumably that is what the blue is commenting: That its a mistake for the installer to remove cinematics if they are already present and that that bug will be fixed.</div></div><hr />

wow, i dont know what to think<br />
<br />
since ive been playing games, and i forget what the first cinematic i viewed was, i can tell you that i was most likely blown away<br />
<br />
and then when i first viewed the WoW cinematics, i was speechless<br />
<br />
they Are a part of the game and/or gaming experience and watching them on youtube isnt gonna cut it</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />

Read the post he linked. It says NOTHING about Cataclysm cinematics.<br />
<br />
It even says &quot;this may change in the future&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have an official post. You linked to it.<br />
We also have an official post stating the opposite thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its nonsense to suggest the time has anything to do with it - its even longer since they said Cataclysm would be out on the December 7th - are you going to say that's not true because its months since they said that?<br />
That is completely unrelated. Usually only the latest word from Blizzard is true.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard came out today and said Cataclysm was delayed and going to be released December 14th, would you come here and tell us we're wrong and it is actually going to be released on December 7th?<br />
<br />
<br />
And that post doesn't contradict anything. A user said the installer had DELETED his cinematics he had from a DVD install, presumably that is what the blue is commenting: That its a mistake for the installer to remove cinematics if they are already present and that that bug will be fixed.<br />
Uh, not that isn't what the first post in that thread says at all. Read it again.<br />
<br />
The user formatted their computer and reinstalled using the streaming client and the cinematics were not installed.<br />
<br />
So yes, it absolutely contradicts the other post as many other users later in that thread note.<br />
<br />
Edit: Thanks to the lovely Luporik above, I have located the post he was referencing.<br />

All the proof one needs is to simply install 4.0.1 CLEANLY using the current digital downloader. You will not get ANY intro cinematics (as others have said, not a huge deal), nor any pre-rendered in game cut scenes (wrathgate, fall of the lich king). So you can argue all you want, but the blue post that has been quoted was in direct response to someone doing exactly what I just suggested, and they we're upset their cut scenes we're gone. A blue responded, gave the answer, and I believe the answer even said &quot;going forward&quot; which is why everyone has to assume going forward from 4.0.1 means Cataclysm as well. He did however say &quot;this may change.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Hello everyone, i am the OP on the thread on the EU forums that was linked here. By seeing this post i just had to register. Well let me beggin, it's the cinematics not the &quot;cinematic&quot;, this means all the in cinematics that in case u don't know will play a huge part on Cata. And if i pay for something i want a full product, or a least a warning i don't want a &quot;Oh ups sry we forgot to mention that.<br />
But now more seriously i really believe that this was not intentional, and that digital copy ppl will get the cinematics too, it's not like Blizz is run by monkeys.</div></div><hr />

That's great and all, but again, install 4.0.1 CLEANLY right this moment. Where are those in-game sequences at? I'm serious, Wrathgate and Fall of the Lich King are both gone. So the actual facts contradict this blue's statements.</div></div><hr />

Right, the bug is that you get a red error on your screen when it goes to play a cinematic (because they're not there). The fix is to disable the game from trying. Not to put the cinematics back in the digital download.</div></div><hr />

I'm not trolling when I'm presenting the opposite side of an argument. Especially one where neither side has a DEFINITIVE answer. The blue post that was quoted was pretty solid, but there is a contradicting blue post (that contradicts reality unfortunately as well), so you're right that it's all speculation at this point, ON BOTH SIDES! No one knows is the best answer, and it's unfortunate considering people are out there spending $39.99 with Blizzard for the Digital Download left and right without the answer.</div></div><hr />

this, i hope im wrong but at this point its best to error on the side safety. If they announce that the cines are included then I will pay them. If not its no skin off my nose to buy a copy.<br />

I'm with you there, I actually have a CE edition pre-ordered for my main account, and than I did the DD for my other 2 accounts. That way I have something to do from Midnight when it goes live until about 7-8pm the next day when my CE edition will most likely arrive from Amazon (my UPS guy likes to come LATE). So I'm in the same boat, I will do a full clean install the moment my CE edition arrives, and I will have all the cinematics. However, I've been following this closely, as I have in the past found it easier to use the digital downloader of the current version than to re-install from DVD and spend a day patching. And since the current Digital Downloader (for 4.0.1) no longer includes the full game, I can't do that anymore. Hence I would like to see a clear answer from Blizzard regarding this.<br />

That way I have something to do from Midnight when it goes live until about 7-8pm the next day when my CE edition will most likely arrive from Amazon (my UPS guy likes to come LATE). So I'm in the same boat, I will do a full clean install the moment my CE edition arrives, and I will have all the cinematics. However, I've been following this closely, as I have in the past found it easier to use the digital downloader of the current version than to re-install from DVD and spend a day patching. And since the current Digital Downloader (for 4.0.1) no longer includes the full game, I can't do that anymore. Hence I would like to see a clear answer from Blizzard regarding this.<br />
<br />
My best guess is that Blizzard will offer an alternative downloader that will stream you the Cinematics.<br />
<br />
In the end the FAQ at http://eu.battle.net/en/info/presale even states that &quot;The digital version consists of the standard edition.&quot; so if the download ends up being limited in any way from the retail version they are setting themselves up for massive amounts of lawsuits/fraud claims.<br />
So this is gonna be fun :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rumor or not, bug or not, old news vs new news or not - this *IS* a serious issue for a lot of players, on which blizzard has been completely silent. Okay,not *completely* silent, but a pair of directly contradictory two sentence posts by tech support guys is hardly definitive communication. This should have, after the amount of reaction it has caused, generated an official response stickied in the forums and clarified on the digital download page within a week. That it *hasn't* been clearly addressed - and the 4.0 digital download system has now been in place for about three weeks - is poor customer service on Blizzard's part regardless of what the answer is, and they deserve some player censure for that.<br />
<br />
Either way, the cinematics are out of the game *NOW*, regardless of whether they're coming for Cataclysm or not. I ran headfirst into the issue last Wednesday, when I helped lead a group of friends through their first LK kill. Two of them had returned to WoW and reinstalled after 4.0, using the digital installer, and as such, missed out on the Fall of the Lich King cinematic on their first kill. For those of us who've been farming it for 9 months, it's not a 'big deal', especially since many of us watched the video here first, but it takes a lot of the 'epic' out of beating to fight to kill him, have your screen lock up for a second or two, and then instead of a video, you get a 'this cinematic is not available' box.</div></div><hr />

You fail at reading comprehension. He's referring to a bug where IF YOU HAVE THE CINEMATICS they don't play properly.<br />
<br />
Not that they're not going to be included with digital download. Are they fucking kidding? That's the biggest pile of shit I've ever read.<br />
<br />
A blue post stating &quot;I have fixed the error in my post stating that they were not available. (I left out a &quot;not&quot;, /fail) So for your clarification, at this time the cinematics are not available from Blizzard either by direct download or by the digital download client.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leaves a lot of wiggle room. &quot;At this time&quot; was true as of two weeks ago. Maybe they're saying vanilla/tbc/wrath cinematics aren't available. <br />
<br />
Does that include the in-game prerendered stuff? People referring to &quot;cinematics&quot; are being stupid, not every cutscene/cinematic is prerendered, and those are the ones that eat up disc space. <br />

<br />
I'm a bit confused here. You see, about 2 months ago my virus checker went a little crazy and deleted a few critical WoW files. Repair failed, so I just backed up my addons and wtf files, deleted WoW, and reinstalled it from the network download. Killed LK a few times since then (including last night) and the cinematic has run. Is this new since 4.0? All in all though, you're quite right. I'm going to be annoyed if I don't get the cinematics for Cataclysm in DD purchase.</div></div><hr />

I refer you to my above post. Also someone made a post in general forums about this got to about 20 pages, no blue response and they moved it to the suggestion forums. Now if its a bug wouldn't they move it too the bug forums?<br />
You're wrong about the bug being reported, read this:<br />
<br />
Right, the bug is that you get a red error on your screen when it goes to play a cinematic (because they're not there). The fix is to disable the game from trying. Not to put the cinematics back in the digital download.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Except that's his opinion, he can't prove it. On the contrary someone working for blizzard has said its fact.<br />
<br />
And two other people working for Blizzard have said it isn't fact. Two &gt; One.<br />
<br />
I already responded to your post in a huge wall of text, please respond to that before further asserting baseless claims.<br />
<br />
<br />
How can we say it's a rumor if a blue is the one who started it? I'd say it's a pretty legitimate worry until we hear more.<br />
<br />
Because there are three contradictory blue posts:<br />

One says they aren't including ANY cinematics in the streaming client.<br />
The second one says it is a bug.<br />
The third one says they aren't including the intro cinematic in the digital download but they are including all in-game cinematics.<br />
<br />
I agree it is a worry until you hear more, but panic and misinformation (like some posters have chosen) isn't the correct solution.<br />

No, it does not contradicts it completely, as right now the downloader/launcher even deletes your cinematics of a dvd installation sometimes, which is really a known issue. Still if protest are high enough I bet blizzard will give us cinematics in the digital download. ;-)<br />

EDIT: If Kotick tries to charge for ingame cinematics, he will see a very significant impact on his customers he thinks are so loyal. I'll likely remain playing WoW, but I sure as hell won't pay for a cinematic. There's just some things that cross the line of stupid.<br />
<br />
Yes, so Blizzard makes more money with your scenario. They know do not want to pay extra will still play, and those who don´t care will spend some extra in cinematics. And BTW, for 90 minutes of extra Cinematics I would pay too. No Problem with that amount, it is a fair deal. Why does this not sound like a bobby idea to me?</div></div><hr />

You can start preloading the Cata data files already. I did so and received 700mb through Blizz' own launcher. I put a thread up in the Cata - General forum named &quot;Preloading Cata now...&quot;.<br />
It's surprisingly easy and now you can be ready with installed files even if you prebought the hardcopy version.</div></div><hr />
