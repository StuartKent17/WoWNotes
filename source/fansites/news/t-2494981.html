We’ve heard your feedback (and experienced it ourselves) – there can be lopsided faction representation during the “Battle for Nazjatar” event. We’ve seen cases where only one faction is represented.<br />
<br />
To address this, we’ve now changed it via hotfix so the “Battle for Nazjatar” will only become active when Nazjatar has a good mix of both Horde and Alliance players in War Mode. When that is not the case, an alternative event will become active called “Azshara’s Elite Commanders.” This is also available to players who are not in War Mode, and it also awards Nazjatar Battle Commendations for slaying Elite commanders during the event.<br />
<br />
We’re continuing to monitor and investigate reports of server lag during the event, and we’re acting on feedback about significantly imbalanced areas. We’ll let you know as we make further changes.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your patience and continued feedback!</div></div><hr />

I'm regularly seeing shards without any Horde when playing my Alliance characters. My Horde friends regularly see shards without any Alliance. There's definitely an issue with the sharding here more than faction balance alone.</div></div><hr />

its not just horde, on my realm allaince has never lost.<br />
thing is it has nothing to do with sharding, if not for sharding EVERY realm would be imbaanced, but with sharding it still is cause people will leave server if they ware losing.<br />

Awesome, they are penalizing people because of their poor sharding. Now the people on these servers will have to try our routes to get conquest. Great job blizz.<br />
<br />
its not because of ppor sharding<br />
its because people leave to another server the second they see they are losing<br />
also how is this penalizing people? this is BETTER<br />

Kinda a crap fix as some one who actually wants to PvP, you’d think the shards would be balanced even if they had to pull from even more Servers.<br />
<br />
there is no problem with sharding, the problem is that if a faction is even slightly ahead, people will go to another server where they are winning by ALOT.<br />

Nice job blizz. Horde was again punished for participation in your game.<br />
<br />
excuse me what? im confused, how des this punish only the horde when this was a oprblem for both factions<br />
and was actuallty bad for horde, cause sometimes horde would not get a reward causen o alliance otk ill<br />
or opposite caus i had manty matches AS ALLIANCE we won 3000-0 with no horde to kill meaning no reward.<br />

WTF? Those devs are retarded or something? Just remove factions and PvP if you can't balance shit.<br />
<br />
just remove factios?<br />
dont you see though, one of the only reasons they have yet to is because of people like people in this very thread who somehow think alliance and horde are literally different races, some people to the extreme where they treat/pretend the other faction is a lesser race then them.<br />
<br />
&quot;those alliance always such carebears, they just want everything handed to them&quot;<br />
literally from this thread, that sounds like something if said about another human race would be called racist, but about alliance players as a whole... thats fine right?</div></div><hr />

If we all go horde, who will you fight in pvp ? It's just as much in the hordes interest that this gets fixed the right way, Alliance wants a fighting chance, and horde wants something to fight...</div></div><hr />

Battle for Naz gave 500 rep per week and 10 manapearls, 10 commendations, 100 conquest and that useless buff per win. Naga commanders only give 2 mana pearls, the useless buff and now apparently some commendations (Doubt it’ll be 10).<br />

I was two damn wins off of getting the mount too. Fuck sake.<br />

Looks near impossible to get in current state unless I'm mistaken. I even checked group finder. NOONE list any Battle for Nazjatar on Alliance so guess 0 battles was going on. There was always 10+ before this hotfix.<br />

They've made the event harder to get into, that's about it.<br />
<br />
Also on a note, the PvE shitshow commanders only drop one commendation, so if you can't find a battle for naz group you're going to have to kill 150 commanders that only spawn one every 3 hours. And you won't receive conquest, rep or any manapearls beyond the 2 you get. Good luck killing more than one commander per event. Losing Naz gave more stuff.<br />
<br />
The best part? Because RP shards (Alliance dominant) are now considered ‘imbalanced’, they’ll get the PvE event. Meaning that all a balanced shard has to do is start a group, invite tons of Horde and the Horde will win every time because there are more Horde Warmode players than Alliance.<br />
<br />
So now the Alliance can’t win the event at all. Hahaha.<br />
<br />
Just got the mount, look forward to getting the flags and pet too now that I’m guaranteed to win.</div></div><hr />

Players joining other groups to leave just because it is a bit hard --&gt; end result factions split in two.<br />
<br />
NOTHING that Blizzard can do about it.<br />
<br />
Between, giving buffs/incentives to the outnumbered faction, fixing/disabling sharding/hopping to ensure only balanced shards exist or instancing the event there are multiple things that Blizzard can do.It's just that Blizzard allows for players to create imbalance by pushing their half-baked war mode system without fixes. But in the end, they won't fix it, rather than being unable to.</div></div><hr />

Then explain why my brother saw me &quot;phasing&quot; in and out 5 times just 10 yards in front of him while I saw 2 allies 10 yards in front of me doing the same. <br />

What is alliance even doing these days? They are not participating in PVP but they are also not competing in PVE (see Hall of Fame leaderbords at the moment)? ?-)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RamGuy</div><div class="date">2019-07-02, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So many bugs all around for me. Don't get me wrong, I love to actually have something new and interesting to do but there are some serious flawed logic going on here.<br />
<br />
Battle for Nazjatar was always awkward. I'm playing on Draenor, there is barely any Alliance player around. I could dedicate 15 min capping capture points during the event only to never encounter a single alliance player giving me no rewards. Why give players no reward when they provide progress towards the capture points? I see the reason for not just handing out reward to every single player in the zone, so if you don't participate in capturing and securing capture points you need to kill a alliance player. But why force people that actually do the points to also having to hunt down alliance players?<br />
<br />
After trying to do it for two days on my realm I just gave up and started using the ground finder. The ground finder is hilarious, it just puts you in a scenario where the horde has every capture point and you completely obliterate the alliance base in Nazjatar. There is no challenge involved and I feel I have to apologise for the unlucky alliance players logging in and porting to the base during these events because you are not going anywhere for the next 20 minutes...<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a much better solution. If there is no real way for having a fair PvP Event just give the PvE Event instead. That is much better instead of forcing one side to never have any real chance for getting rewards, and it's much better for players running around without a single player from the opposing faction to kill locking you out of any real way of getting the reward.<br />
<br />
But was the Battle vs Commanders fair in the first place? I've done the commanders twice now, and I've done the Battle several times and the Commander PvE Event seem to grant me Manapearl's every time while the Battle PvP Event never gave me any? The Commander PvE Event is finished in like 2-5 minutes, the PvP Event even when holding all the capture point's takes at least 20 minutes. How is this balance? Why would you not simply prefer to do the Commander's each and every time considering it's rewards and the time to complete compared to the Battle event?<br />
<br />
<br />
There are also some flawed logic behind how tagging and world events work. When Azshara summons the Elite commander in the middle of the zone, and you take down the end &quot;boss&quot; from 100% to 5% HP and die and releases you don't get the event rewards (the one granting you + rep) you can only loot. What kind of logic is this and how is it possible for the game to behave in such a way in 2019? I have not tested to see what happens if you don't release, but still... I participated in the entire event, only to die seconds before the end mob was dead and lost the entire reward for the event.<br />
<br />
Sharding is also problem went hunting for rare spawns. I have encountered this several times. You notice a rare, but before reaching it you get moved into another shard where the rare is not there. This is extremely frustrating. And events like The Doppel Gang is bugged beyond reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
I also hate the heavy time-gating. The questing progression in Mechagon is limited to one new quest per day, and the progression in Nazjatar is stuck behind the get 3000 rep with a follower which will take you days.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hugh Wattmate</div><div class="date">2019-07-02, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This whole Warmode thing is a failure. A few things they could do are:<br />
1) Mercenary mode (let horde aid alliance)<br />
2) Remove rewards for having WM ON.<br />
<br />
Right now as an alliance who does PVP your likely have WM off because you literally cant do anything PVE/PVP without getting ganked 50:1. Its literally player vs raid, not player vs player. I can't blame even the PVP loving Alliance from turning WM off.<br />
<br />
As for horde, i like most who don't PVP turn WM on as its &quot;free stuff&quot; no reason not to have it on. This just aids to the imbalance as your having alliance turning it off (even those who like PVP) and horde (who might not like PVP) turning it on for free stuff. <br />
<br />
The horde who do like PVP with it on also get shafted with WM, as its hard to find alliance sometimes, chances are your going to be pushed into a shard with very few alliance. With this new system you might never get to actually pvp due to bad luck getting a good shard. <br />
<br />
If a mercenary mode was allowed then those who like PVP can do PVP. I also see no reason to give &quot;free stuff&quot; for turning it on that idea is a failure just scrap it there doesnt need to be an incentive to PVP, ether you do it because you like it or you turn it off because you don't.</div></div><hr />

Are you for real??? player will always cheat the content. <br />
<br />
The unbalance bettwen Alliance and horde have been present since Vanilla. That why you have heavy Allaince servers or heavy Horde servers. <br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with the state of the game.<br />
<br />
Plus this issues with the event, have 0 to do with sharding, is the player foult that they dont want to engane on pvp so you have unbalance all over the place. <br />
<br />
Im from Stormrage, that you have 5v1 H v A number doing WM. Alliance tent to been alot less active on pvp. From Bgs to Wpvp. <br />
<br />
So tell how you make player do something they dont want. This solution is good and bad at the same time, since it wont prevent the server hopping and the inbalance on killing the Generals will still be there, and you will get gank to oblivion</div></div><hr />

yeah thats pretty much the only way, but even then it wouldnt fix it cause there would still be alliance servers and horde servers, and instead of making groups they just... wouldnt try...<br />

<br />
It's not the perfect fix. I really hope this is a band-aid and a more permanent fix is on the works, but at least it makes the battle more balanced.<br />
<br />
Their sharding tech really needs some work. Maybe they should stick with layering or just work a new idea from the ground up.</div></div><hr />

In theory, if you manage to tag all 5 you will get the same rewards, yes. <br />
I barely managed to get 2, when they spawned for me for the first time, moments ago.<br />
<br />
Impossible to get all of them, unless you are alone on your shard.<br />
<br />
better to get a reward then not get your reward because you cant find an enemy to kill.<br />
also you can kill some then realm hop and find some more.</div></div><hr />

Here is an example I just encountered. <br />
Shows how buggy Nazjatar is. This happens all over the zone. Entering a named area makes you phase into a different CRZ. If you are on the edge of several named areas, you jump in and out of different phasings/CRZ's. This is super bad when it comes to PvP as enemies vanish and reappear several times. You lose your target whenever they &quot;zone&quot; out, which is really fucked up.<br />

This was just an example of what we encountered last night. Not tje EXACT situation you fool.<br />
All I say is that the 2 alliance running in front of us vanished and reappeared at least 5 times over a period of about 1 min. I did not take the time or record and I don't care if you believe it or not. All I know is what I saw, and how fucked up it felt losing the target over and over again. They both died in the end, so I was happy though. I thought first it was just a bug at my pc, but my brother told me he saw the same with my character also. And we are playing from different locations, so it's definitely related to Blizzards CRZ system which is fucked up. Now go ahead and make an even bigger fool of yourself. Eagerly anticipating your reply.</div></div><hr />

<br />
NOTHING that Blizzard can do about it.<br />
<br />
Only thing I can think of that might work is the sharding tech trying to get a balance of X horde and X alliance players in the zone, and once the numbers are even, start the event and lock the shard for the duration of the battle. Nobody can exit the shard while in the zone, nobody new can enter the shard via grouping unless a player physically leaves the zone, in which case the sharding will suck in a random ungrouped player in Nazjatar matching the faction with fewer players. Players can use general chat or local defence to organize their groups for the event.<br />
<br />
I’m really not sure what else you could do. The cross-server, cross-shard group finder tool completely circumvents any balancing act the shard tries between the factions, so disabling it is really the only course of action ... if you want an event like this to work. What else can you do, really? Supply the under populated faction with ye olde wintergrasp tenacity? Implement NPC allies for their team using the new AI tech (is that just PVE..?)?</div></div><hr />

Me and my brother has done the exact same quests, so blaming phasing because of quests is bullshit <br />
<br />
I say again: Blizzards sharding technology is absolutely fucked up these days.<br />
<br />
It's phasing. You don't understand what sharding is. If it was sharding you and your brother would still be in the same &quot;realm&quot;. Sharding carries the entire party over. Once you shard over to a no shard you don't return back to your old shard at all unless someone invites you back to tit.<br />
<br />
So yes, it's still phasing. People blaming sharding for things and don't understand how it works is getting a bit old. It's like people going &quot;wtf sharding made this vein/herb/chest disappear&quot;. No, it just means someone got to it 30 seconds prior to you and it finally despawned.</div></div><hr />

is did work this way, it would actually try to keep people in the shard once it began and you got a kill, happened to me a few times, but people brute forced it so hard it broke and people called it a bug so blizz is reverting it, so you can hop, cause people complained.</div></div><hr />

The only reason Alliance don't turn it on is because it's just not worth it. It was worth it when we were down but we got 30% and an item. Then it started to balance out, so the Horde complained and within a week Blizzard nerfed the item and the %Bonus. Like, at this point I'm pretty damn sure the Horde were using the item as an excuse to complain and what they were actually upset about was that they had to do a little bit of work for their 10% instead of it being completely free.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, before War Mode, the PvPers would always crow, &quot;I just love world PvP, I don't need rewards!&quot; It is the reward structure that's screwing up war mode. If they just removed the rewards (on both sides), then it would be no incentive for people to faction change, and no incentive for the PvE people to join war mode for the free rewards, further imbalancing it.<br />

Mercenary mode would also help, I agree.<br />

So alliance got free heroic gear, conquest, and ap for weeks, but its bad if horde get that for a week? I wish i were surprised by your logic.<br />

I'm sure someone else already mentioned this, but the heroic gear was 1 time only, then it was &quot;fixed&quot;. And even when that happened, Blizz said the Alliance was still outnumbered that week.</div></div><hr />

LOL before WM the balance was screw too, allince been on the losing side since Vanilla lunch, Horde for some reason (racials) is more appalling to players<br />
<br />
The issue is that ppl complain about the a problem that will never will be solve. And the only real problem here is the players. Alliance can QQ all they want, but try to make a group to fight the horde, and no one will join. Or if you fighitng 2v1 and another player just past near you it wont help. <br />
<br />
Is the nature of the player base, and the only solution is removing Wpvp (that will never happen since is been part of the game since day 1) and even if you remove Wpvp you still have the issue on BG or Arenas where Horde dominate.<br />
<br />
So learn to deal with it and just jump servers to do the event and win like most ppl do.<br />
<br />
And lets not mention mercenary mode, bc the only reason a mode like that can work is if you offer some incentive to the player to swith side to the losing side. If not it will not help at all.</div></div><hr />

The main problem with that was the ilvl of the gear. It was basically free gear, a 400ilvl geared piece without any effort.<br />
<br />
Also, you did pointed out, as soon as the reward did go away they lost the interest. I've been playing on a pvp server even when there was no benefit of doing that, just because it feels odd for not being able to attack an Alliance when doing quests in the world.

That's not actually true, Alliance had the better population for all of Vanilla. Blood elves helped reverse that. But the qualitative difference in population did not start happening until Cata and the change was not visible until MoP. And I say qualitative because the population is not as skewed, it's the fact that hardcore players pick one faction over the other by a significant margin (but are outnumbered by casuals who prefer the more vanilla Alliance).</div></div><hr />

Huh... Weird. I've killed plenty of alliance players when the timer stops at 3000/3000. Seems to give plenty of leeway in favor tbh...<br />

I did notice that if you cast a spell that lands right as trey die and you get a dmg number you might not get credit due to them actually dying slightly before and you didn't contribute.</div></div><hr />

Which is why they nerfed it a week later. The issue was, they also nerfed the bonus, because no way did they in one week suddenly have enough of an influx to drop the bonus from 30 to 20% when it didn't even do that in a month just because one item got sent out with the incorrect ilvl.</div></div><hr />
