Another day, another kill by Paragon (http://www.paragon.fi/) who was the first guild to defeat the Ascendant Council of the Twilight Bastion in the world. Congratulations to them!<br />
<br />
The second day of year 2011 brought us Ascendant Council 25-man heroic mode kill. This was one of the fights we were most looking forward to after beta testing. It was a huge letdown for some, but others enjoyed it. Somewhat bittersweet.<br />
<br />
Also, a big thank you for the melee DPS'ers who play in the guild. They had to pass up spots again for alts, simply because the encounter design is incredibly punishing for any melee. It's a pretty glaring oversight when bringing in more than one or two of them results in ridiculous increases in damage taken in the last phase due to non-stop chaining chain lightning. Dropping out melee characters in favor of ranged ones has been a recurring theme throughout this whole raiding tier, but we hope that it's over now with only the end bosses and Sinestra left.<br />
<br />
Here's to hoping next tier of raiding won't favor ranged by design. Maybe even go wild and give some incentive to bring in melee, too. (Paragon.fi (http://www.paragon.fi/node/199))<br />

Why would &quot;what Paragon does to get the world first heroic kill in ungodly timeframes&quot; really have anything to do with you, or 98% of the guilds out there? <br />
<br />
By the time the masses hit H AC (you know, who they design around), class balances will have happened, people will have had a lot of time to acquire gear, and this won't be an issue. When you're looking to get the first kills in the world, doing content that was barely tested, you're probably going to stack the raid in a way that makes it easier to get that virtual pat on the back. Don't get that confused with &quot;the encounter is impossible unless you do it this way&quot;.<br />
<br />
Paragon should honestly know better than to start panic over something like 1 or 2 bosses requiring caster stacking. I mean, casters didn't spend the vast majority of Ulduar being outshined by melee, did we? Oh wait, yeah we did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guilds like Paragon set the trends and influence the opinions of large portions of the population. When they do/say something like this, you can be sure there will be plenty of guilds and raid leaders out there who will follow the example set. It's certainly a valid concern, although you do bring up many good counter points and hopefully it won't turn out the way he fears.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was only my thought but the number of bosses where ranged stand still and melee move in and out (stopping dps) is too high, not even considering the trash pack that sometimes are a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As someone who played both melee and ranged throughout WoTLK, melee had it a lot worse. I remember General Vezax on my melee character and saying &quot;Oh my god, a fight where I don't have to move at all.&quot;. Having to move a tad to the right or left as a ranged was barely an inconvenience at all. It interrupted my spell casting for about 0.1 seconds, while on most fights as melee, I either had to run away or chase after a boss. <br />
<br />
After experiencing 2 instances in Cata so far, they are extremely rough on melee. Stonecore has been the worse so far, and I'm not looking forwards to it on Heroic due to all the melee unfriendly abilities the trash and bosses have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Class balances and fixes don't happen if no one brings up the issue. We've seen it time and time again, Blizzard refuses to to prioritise on specific mechanics unless a lot of noise is made (and most of the time they adhere to legitimate noise being made.) The poster you quoted is merely saying that he's worried about certain encounters requiring class stacking, and it's quite the legitimate concern since it goes against the Bring the player philosophy. By the time the masses hit H AC, the balance will only happen if the masses show some cause for concern.<br />
<br />
So far only one guild has downed H AC and not only have they admitted to needing to stack range, they've specifically explained why it was needed. From your final line, it seems quite clear that you see this argument purely as a melee vs range debate, when really this argument should be about balance for all classes. Whether melee or range were favoured in the past is completely irrelevant, and if raiding worked in a tit for tat way where it's &quot;well you guys were favoured last time, it's our turn now!&quot; then raiding would be even more broken than ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realise they didnt use a ranged set up cased on a dps requirement due to a balancing issue. Despite more gear healers will still have to heal and the encounter is still going to be a pain for melee particularly the last phase where its going to be a border line cluster fuck in the puddles and seeds. Atremedes is the boss where the dps was an issue to ranged was stacked however due to the air phase. The issues with council will likely be a result of new, modified or empowered boss mechanics particularly in the last phase.</div></div><hr />

The way that fight finishes is the damage ramps up the longer the phase lasts. Eventually the raid falls over due to the damage output. Obviously, the fight favors using ranged classes, which can simultaneously avoid chaining the lightning and maintain 100% uptime on the kited boss, and never needs to worry about the ice puddles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm guessing you're a ret pally, b/c no other melee class can argue that mages are op pve-wise compared to their class right now. <br />
<br />
On to the topic of ranged vs. melee in Cataclysm. There are still fights that are easier as a melee class (Magmaw) but the class balance issue is a true concern. As others have said in this thread, when you reach the point that melee have to sit out a fight in order for the guild to be able to down a boss, there needs to be a fix of either mechanics or damage output. It's not an issue of being unable to have the majority of the dps as melee in your raid, it's an issue of being unable to have any melee dps in your raid.</div></div><hr />

Magmaw definitely isn't one of those fights either. Everything becomes extremely simple on the heroic mode if you can field a 100% ranged setup, excluding tanks.<br />

I'm not saying Magmaw is an easier fight if you have all melee dps, i'm just saying that the requirements of the melee on that fight are much less than that of the ranged dps. One could argue that it's because they're basically useless for the fight besides impaling Magmaw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, but doing the encounter Paragon's way may not be the only way to beat the encounter. The problem with world first progression raiding is that you don't have time to gear up all your main characters and figure out how to down the boss with what you have. If there is a quicker way to down the boss, you will take it no matter what the sacrifice so that you can be #1. The immediate concern is that many guilds will see this as the only way to beat the encounter quickly and not lose out on the coveted server first. I know plenty of 25 man guilds that were racing for server first H LK and stacked Paladins to eliminate infest after they saw Paragon's world first makeup. It may have not been the only way to beat the encounter, but it was the only way to beat it first.</div></div><hr />

This is hard enough to heal away in ten man non-hero. You stack caster dps and only take two melee to interrupt feludius and suddenly chain lightning is no longer a problem. heroic mode AsC also appears to have a lightning charge that players get, another way to stop melee dps doing what they should be doing and banish them to the edge of the room so they do not kill anybody.</div></div><hr />

This is an issue even on normal mode. Not just heroic. And yes, there's quite a few guilds doing them. And yes, they are favoring ranged DPS, cause lets face it, why shouldn't they?</div></div><hr />

Unless melee got an upgrade in hp/survivability or healers suddently ere able to put out a lot more group healing then this fight will never ever favour melee. The damage put out on tight nit groups on this encounter is insane. Even on kills you end up with only one or two melee left. It isn't a class balance thing, it's shoddy encounter design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly! And it is good to see such thing. I am simply crossing my fingers hoping they just won't tune the fight down for everyone to be happy.</div></div><hr />
