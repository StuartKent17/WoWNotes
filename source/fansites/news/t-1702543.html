Love is in the Air 2015<br />
Love is in the Air (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/423-love-is-in-the-air) once again, at least until February 16! There are a few new additions this year, and you can still run the Crown Chemical Co. encounter every day for a chance at the Big Love Rocket (http://www.wowdb.com/items/50250-big-love-rocket)! <br />
<br />
This year adds item level 635 necks, a toy, a pet (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/85710-lovebird-hatchling), and some new achievements that require a group. <br />

Just a reminder that the opening of Blackrock Foundry is *not* tied to maintenance tomorrow. Rolling restarts will occur at 5:00 am PST, and then Normal and Heroic Blackrock Foundry will be opening at approximately 10:00 am PST.<br />

Release Schedule (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/17541534/blackrock-foundry-raid-schedule-1-14-2015) Raid Preview<br />
<br />
<br />
It is a flat out lie claiming that BRF is opening for everyone. It is opening up for a select group of players and still closed to a very large portion of players.<br />
Everyone is capable of dipping their toe into Normal raids, if not Heroic. The number of people going into Normal and downing bosses, either with their guild or with PUGs using the Premade Groups finder is quite large. In actuality the majority of people who have done Raid Finder have also killed bosses on at least Normal, if not higher. The select group, in your example, would really be those that only try Raid Finder. Raid Finder is an option a lot of people use, and we continue supporting it, but it wouldn't be accurate to say only a select few go into Normal difficulty and above.<br />

Correct. We've been seeing a bunch of confusion about this, so let me try to clarify as best as I can:<br />
<br />
The opening of Blackrock Foundry is completely independent of the release of Patch 6.1. At roughly 10AM Pacific time tomorrow, the entrance to Blackrock Foundry will activate, and you'll be able to zone in and start killing stuff. No patch necessary.<br />
<br />
Similarly, any of the new changes or features listed in the Patch 6.1 PTR notes (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/17561381/61-ptr-patch-notes-1-23-2015) will not be live until Patch 6.1 actually releases. That includes the Heirlooms collection, stage 4 crafted gear, new follower missions, various talent buffs, and the updated Blood Elf model. Any changes made prior to the release of Patch 6.1 (including balance changes and bugfixes) will be noted in our Patch 6.0.3 Hotfix Blog (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/16561637/603-hotfixes-january-21-1-21-2015). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/360339-61-release-date/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16200920466?page=1#18))<br />
<br />
Blackrock Foundry Opening Time<br />
Correct. Blackrock Foundry is scheduled to open at 10AM Pacific / 1PM Eastern. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/360315-is-there-a-specific-time-when-brf-opens/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16203160667?page=1#7))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not as specific as you might think. If I'm reading it right then if your raid leader is a healer who is only healing and never touches Ogron, then your raid was SoL.</div></div><hr />

It's my sarcastic mocking response to this.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a flat out lie claiming that BRF is opening for everyone. It is opening up for a select group of players and still closed to a very large portion of players.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair.... this is kinda wash since the reason LFR is 3 weeks behind normal mode is because real raiders cried about LFR people being able to kill bosses before them, or of being ´forced´ to run LFR for gear so they can raid.<br />
<br />
A bit hard to make fun of someone for crying about something, when the thing they are crying about was caused from other people crying. The game is basically filled with a bunch of selfish children who car rarely see ´the greater good´ unless it directly benefits them.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard was nice enough to add it in in Dragon Soul, and all that people do that get an easier version of the dungeon that before Dragon Soul was never available is whine and complain? Depressing. If they want to see content earlier then they should put in a bit of effort and try the already easy normal difficulty. If they can't even do that, then a couple of weeks won't harm them.</div></div><hr />

Has way less to do with players crying than it does with Blizz hoping to keep LFR raiders subbed longer.</div></div><hr />

you need boss kill count , for mission to show up anyway, which require atleast 2 week full clear of whole instance, you don't lose anything <br />
<br />
and wtf with love prism achievement are they nuts, making it even more rediculious by raising cd...</div></div><hr />

Stop crying and trying to blame the &quot;elitists&quot;,go tou group finder,or the general chat and get in it.Those fake complaints are becoming boring.The only thing thats preventing you from entering a normal raid is your own self and make no mistake about it.</div></div><hr />

No, you don't. Killing bosses makes loot better. But normal-mode loot you can get without killing anyone (but you need Follower ilvl)</div></div><hr />

You can farm the same early/easy bosses until you hit the 15 kills in a week as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not for the base mission, you need the certain number of kills on each individual difficultly to upgrade the cache to the one above it and even then the kills can be farmed before the week is up as they're based on boss kills which can be gotten from redoing the raid with another pug group. Even then we don't know if the number for cache upgraded is the same as Highmaul and we won't know till 6.1.</div></div><hr />

Something tells me you'd be mad even if they had opened up Blackrock Foundry at the start and then there was nothing to do between now and the next raid.</div></div><hr />

Well that's great isn't it. You know what would be nice. A blizzard post where they explain how the sub is contributing to the game and its development. A list of what goes where, in percentages. Because at the moment, it seems the people that still sub to this lunacy are inadvertently share holders and they deserve to see this information.</div></div><hr />

And it will get them nowhere , as long as they stay and pay nothing will change .<br />
Unsubbing when you are not enjoying the game is what they should do .<br />
If you love the game stay and play/pay if not bye bye , sure blizz will love to see you all go .:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
