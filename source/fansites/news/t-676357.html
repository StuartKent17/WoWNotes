Serious? No, I mean, seriously? What were you expecting from a frost wyrm twice the size of Sapphiron? Spitting fire and poison, and rolling in thunder? Suggest something instead of looking like a buffoon then..<br />
<br />
It'd be amusing if this fight was part aerial with Sindragosa, reaching for the skies and a few of us having to climb on her and dps'ing her wings so that she'd be forced to land in a set period of time, else we'd fall, all the while circling ICC. But hey, haven't seen them drop her to 50% yet so no clue if it's a phased fight...</div></div><hr />

Don't worry, to counter this they're adding a 1 point talent in the Feral tree entitled &quot;Dire Polar Bear&quot; which will give you a 75% chance to resist all Frost related spells, cause you're a Poooooooooooooooooolar Bear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Illitti</div><div class="date">2009-10-30, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Geez, they are really making these fights tuned to be anti-avoidance tanked and just stam stam stam.Avoidance stacking tanks are so fun to heal. For a minute, you're not required to do anything, then the boss bursts a tank down in less than a second.<br />
<br />
I'm not a tank but a healer, and from my point of view, tanks stacking avoidance have forgot what they exist for. The tanks have 2 general goals they must succeed in an encounter by performing and gearing appropriately: maintain the aggro and stay alive (with a help of a healer of course). For the arguments sake, let's say we have a boss that hits for 20k to a certain tank with a swing speed of 1 second. Now, if you have a tank that has 38k hp and 60% dodge, the chance that boss will hit him twice in a row is still possible, even probable considering most fights last over 5 minutes. This boss would kill that tank in 2 blows if he had no heals inbetween the blows. If the tank healer is just in the middle of his cast between those blows, we'd have a dead tank over here. Now, tank nr. 2 has 42k hp and 20% dodge. This tank requires A LOT more healing, but that's hardly any problem considering paladins still have infinite mana if they are geared like they should be. That paladin might even be happy because he's most likely topping the meters because of his tanks crappy avoidance. This latter tank does NOT die in 2 blows, but it'd take 3 to kill him, which would require the tank healer to screw something up pretty bad to get his tank killed.<br />
<br />
In short, tanks that have bigger health pools are MUCH easier to heal than avoidance stacking ones. I'm happy that my guild has tanks who realize this.</div></div><hr />

Do you recall how many people were viewing the stream? It probably has more to do with that than anything to do with where the video is being streamed from. You apparently are able to access streams from both the US and the EU, just like thousands of other people, how does your argument make sense in this context?</div></div><hr />

At least put some small blue Dragonkins in it which support her or stuff like that.<br />
Give her some sorta Skill while she's flying that can blow you of the map when you're not watching.<br />
Stuff like that :P</div></div><hr />

Ain't it better to have a frost Res tank taunt and eat the breaths and then the other tank taunts back? Abilities seem interesting I do wonder how often they are used (especially how many unchained magic debuffs can be up simultaneously). Icy grip sounds interesting especially if the timers are random a bit (icy grip conciding with a tomb?). Like how she has both anti caster and anti melee abilities. Hunters will probably like her a lot.<br />

<br />
&quot;Causes those who attack Sindragosa with physical attacks to be chilled to the bone, reducing their movement speed by 1000% per application, for 8 sec seconds. Instant&quot;<br />

Unless it's meant to mean melee attacks, we aren't going to like this fight any more than melee will.<br />

Hate to be &quot;that guy&quot;, and I'm quite embarassed to ask this, but I've been searching for new raid frames lately. What are the ones on the left?<br />
<br />
OT: The video looks great. I'm really looking forward to this encounter. I don't know if it's been said, but keep in mind this is the PTR meaning content is still untested. Also, this is normal mode. Heroic is gonna be pretty insane most likely.</div></div><hr />

ICC was supposed to be the instance everyone was waiting for 1 year now.<br />

<br />
I'd suggest killing the boss on Heroic mode, then complain about recycled mechanics. Nothing on PTR should ever be representative of encounter difficulty. Anything you see on PTR/Normal mode is just a watered down version of the intended design.<br />
<br />
Perspectives are very important, too. Mimiron, Vezax and Anub'arak don't really appear to incorporate alot of variation on their harder difficulties. It's easy to observe and say, &quot;ok so we aoe the adds, kite the boss to the ice and only heal the tanks + penetrating cold targets&quot; and pass it off as easy, but the execution is alot more complex in practice.<br />
<br />
When Icecrown launches, I suspect we'll see a wide variety of new and improved mechanics, along with some innovations of old ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree completely.. I'm sick of reading all the people saying &quot;QQ this is the same as sapp!!&quot;.<br />
<br />
As mentioned, of course it is - it's a frost-based dragon encounter. But in order to cater to the masses, they'll be sure to add more fire'n'brimstone next time they make a frost wyrm boss fight.... ::)<br />
<br />
Personally, the mechanics are almost always going to be the same, otherwise people will complain *even more*. Look at what happened with FL (quote: &quot;ARHGGHGH I HATE NOT BEING ABLE TO SPAM MY ABILITIES!!!!!!!!!!&quot;) - imagine what would happen if they put everyone in a similar situation to p3 Maly. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
the fact you can compare almost any boss in WoW now to some other pre existing boss is a sign of the games age.<br />
<br />
that said i expected this to be along the lines of a more complicated high damage version of Sapphiron (which it is) so i dont really have much empathy with people who were expecting the final boss from some bullet hell shooter or something disguised as a Frost Wyrm.<br />
<br />
like a lot of posts about wow i suspect its in essence just moaning as a 'sport'.</div></div><hr />

Would appear that @ about 20% she stops flying and instead just randomly marks/freezes a raid member every so often, yes? Noticed that the last video had a couple of blocks left @ the end, thought I'd just missed something... This video shows it a lot clearer (or I just paid more attention).</div></div><hr />

<br />
For some reason I can see elitist guilds bringing 0 melee because of the movement speed debuff, and they didn't want a repeat of SW /eyeroll.<br />
<br />
But what do you expect? It's the last raid of this entire expansion. It's supposed to be hard, require actual thought, and be complicated.<br />
Lol@ &quot;plz give me moar naxx welfarez plz&quot;<br />
I'm glad it's going to be hard. Pre BC, there was Naxx, barely anyone saw it because it was so challenging. Pre Wrath *and pre nerf* SWP was very difficult and not a lot of guilds saw it, or even got to KJ. Why would this place be any different? There is a 10 man for people who suck, don't worry.</div></div><hr />

In Sapphiron's defense, he was nerfed to holy hell for WotLK.<br />
<br />
I still remember watching the Death &amp; Taxes video for their first attempt on him back in the day. <br />
<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byXKQaYpoSg<br />
<br />
Of course now, everyone knows the strat, and he was also nerfed to the point of lolfrostresistwut!?<br />
At the time it was the coolest thing i'd seen in game, but yeah, we're all jaded after 3 more years.<br />
<br />
I'll agree though, now that Sindragosa's abilities are listed, it looks way more interesting than Sapphy.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Although i'm disapointed there are no waves of frost whelps to come out and inundate the raid during air phase. Handle it!)</div></div><hr />

That's kind of a ridiculous statement...<br />
Ever try doing 10man's in actual 10man Gear rather than being decked in shitloads of 25man gear?<br />
ToC patch is the perfect example, 10man Guilds were so limited to trophies and badges...<br />
<br />
I am in a 10man Guild myself, and there is no doubt that the content is challenging when you have some bad gear.<br />
Try Algalon 10 with raiders decked in Val Gear and some Naxx shit...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically after this game has been out this long, WHAT? can they do that either hasn't been done or even remotely makes sense.<br />
<br />
The arthas fight, I dont want to spoil anything because frankly I didn't watch the video, but I do know there was QQ about it making NO SENSE at all, however it sounded original (i guess?)<br />
<br />
Now this new fight is a copy of saph/mimiron. I keep hearing we want whelps etc to spawn, if things spawned randomly or were trigger by certain actions would we not then be complaining about it coping Onyxia?<br />
<br />
I just think the low point is when people mention things, yet have nothing more beneficial and/or positive that they can think of. Unless most of the people are failing to mention it.<br />
<br />
I'm not upset, nor am I in a nerdrage, this is just my viewpoint. I am still on the fence somewhat about Blizzard. I think tier 9 was absolute laziness, and I think some of tier 10 is ugly. I think ToC is clearly a filler (and imo failed at that).<br />
<br />
TL:DR - Regardless of what is done or happens a boss will be copying another boss somewhat, and I am in no way a fanboy etc etc blah blah.</div></div><hr />

I'd add some Shade of Aran, that boss from Hijal who randomly kills ppl, and Vuljin who punishes casters in Tornado phase. Fight has many aspects and is restrictive to phase running. Most likely will not be brute forceable regardless of your gear level. I bet healing gets interesting when you get 2k damage per cast in 8 sec (some haste-capped druids can kill themselves dead, right?), especially if you are taking 4,5k cold damage per 3 sec. That alone gonna hurt a raid, even after resistance. Add soft enrage rush to the mix - you want to kill it faster, because you are losing raid members constantly. But casters are restricted due to small amount of spells cast in 8 sec. And melee are unwanted, too. All in all - gonna be interesting, I happen to like this particular fight the most of anything that was in ICC yet. Call me a noob or fanboy if you like, I don't really care.</div></div><hr />
