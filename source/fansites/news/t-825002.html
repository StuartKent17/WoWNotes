Dungeon Finder and Gear Detection<br />
We would love to implement better ways for Dungeon Finder to detect if players know what they're doing in dungeons beyond just the gear they've accumulated. We have some long-term design goals in mind for this we're not quite prepared to share this early on though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/149061/dungeon-queue-should-be-performance-based))<br />
<br />
Why did we die?<br />
One flaw with the current system, is if players fail in a pick-up group, they aren't told why they failed. People then tend to play the blame game, often directing malice at the healer(s).<br />
<br />
So while I'm speaking more about class roles, I think the idea still lends itself to your question. It'd be helpful to get more information than just through trial and error. Groups could benefit if they knew they didn't wipe because the healer didn't manage mana well enough, but because the DPS wasn't high enough, or boss adds weren't properly rounded up, etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/149061/dungeon-queue-should-be-performance-based))<br />

No but a system similar to the Playerscore add-on which records your experience in dungeons/raids would be an idea. That way people will be able to tell how many times you've downed certain bosses and therefore be able to guage your experience with certain encounters.</div></div><hr />

While I can sympathize with an add-on developer whose project was made obsolete because blizzard chose to duplicate the functionality. there are no rewards at all other than the satisfaction of providing a utility that many people want and appreciate. but really shouldn't it be the goal to provide such a good add-on that blizzard chooses to incorporate it into the game, saving you the time and effort to maintain it?</div></div><hr />

Really? ....Really?<br />
Something that saves scanning through your combat log for other's actions, and you throw the casual/bad/hand-holding/free epics argument? Something that would make randoms run smoother, turning runs from 'can we even finish?' to 'how can we work things out to finish?' makes you upset?<br />

<br />
They adopt the idea, not the code. Whenever they decide an addon functionality is becoming kinda necessary to play the game (like boss mods, scrolling combat text, gear manager, quest helper) they go and start discussing how to improve the default interface in order to have that functionality, without the usual hassle of addons (like configuration).</div></div><hr />

Blizzard creates the addon framework.<br />
Blizzard customer creates an addon based on Blizzard's existing code to make the game slightly more user-friendly.<br />
Addon is adopted by other Blizzard customer's.<br />
Blizzard recognizes the usefulness of said customer's addon and decides it shouldn't be an &quot;add-on,&quot; and instead should be integrated into the game.<br />
Blizzard creates a polished, maintained, version of the addon's functionality that allows everyone to use it.<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't prevent the customer who originally created said addon from continuing development, which allows them to continue working on it if Blizzard's version doesn't meet the customers' expectations.<br />
<br />
Either way, the functionality is now there, and it wasn't beforehand.<br />
<br />
Blizzard isn't knocking anything off, and I doubt you'd find an addon developer that isn't glad to see their work appreciated by the developers of the game they are customizing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What part of taking an idea and implementing it the same way is not knocking off? Your points are true and I never critizied blizzard for getting inspired by other games. But taking some ideas from a different game and completely copy and pasting addons are two different things.<br />
<br />
Stop thinking blizzard is nice, remember the whole &quot;YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ACCEPT DONATIONS FOR ADDONS!!!!11&quot;. I mean seriously how dare some addon authors post a donate button on a website, that is just wrong. But taking credit for stolen ideas is completely acceptable.<br />
<br />
Question for you: A newb starts playing this game and finds the cheap questhelper knockoff really good. So what does that newb say? Wow blizzard sure is cool with all their creativity.....<br />
<br />
Unless blizzard gives some ingame credit to those authors my opinion will be the same.</div></div><hr />

Well whatever you may think of charity like that at least some money goes to the people that need it.<br />

Also, I vary rarely see these 'wotlk babies' everyone has jumped on the popular complaint bandwagon about. For the most part, it seems like people have really risen to the occasion and are putting in the extra effort to win.<br />
<br />
Of the few problems I've seen, a major one has been against DPS not doing what they should do and draining the healer's mana. Honestly, I think melee dps are the biggest issue in Cata. I urge you all to reroll. These fights aren't intended to have melee dps.<br />

&quot;Yes they honor them............the Chinese honor Rolex too when they make knockoffs I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have more respect for Chinese knock-offs than I do for a multi-billion dollar company that profits on the backs of charities.<br />
That was and is the slimiest policy I have ever seen. But all the fan boys wet their pants and get sucked in by it.<br />
<br />
I have to agree. This sort of 'concern marketing' is fairly ghastly. They're not donating to charity, they're making profit. You are donating to charity and blizzard is using your good feelings of altruism as marketing fodder. If Blizzard was going to actually donate to charity, they would give some of their billions to charity, not make millions off of having you do it.</div></div><hr />

I like this idea with a slight variation. You do the questionnaire while in the queue. Especially useful for DPS as they have longer queues. Every 15seconds a question pops up with a random question on various dungeons. Answering correctly moves you closer to the front of the queue. Every incorrect answer sends you closer to the back of the queue. This has a 2 fold effect. You will have a better chance of not queuing with bad dps, plus the dps is less likely to be afk when the dungeon pops. After all, how often do we sit through 3 iterations of the dungeon finder popping because one of the dps has gone afk while waiting.</div></div><hr />

Even better if the DPS isn't told whether they got the answer wrong or right! XD And yes, I too have been guilty of that. More often alt-tabbing, though. :(</div></div><hr />

+9000 . The &quot;droid armory&quot; is cool and all but not as good as the original.</div></div><hr />

Then its perfectly OK in any sense. IDK if they did but I doubt they didn't at least try... Can't be that hard to send in e-mail or make a call... I personally would be honored if a major gaming company wanted to use a program I created...<br />
<br />
Anyways for that bunny quest... Painful but since I love animals the next quest was funish except for the pure rage it brought me when they fricken got one shot by inferno lords... Then the baby cub quest... lol throwing them into flaming trees was worth it...</div></div><hr />
