Addon Review - OreCrusher (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
OreCrusher (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/orecrusher.aspx) is an addon that helps Jewelcrafters determine the most profitable way to use ore. It is similar to the Shuffling Spreadsheet (http://consortium.stormspire.net/content.php?183-The-Shuffling-Spreadsheet-That-Killed-Them-All&amp;page=3) and has most of the features necessary from it. <br />
<br />
After manually entering the price of a stack of Cataclysm Ore, it will give you the optimal route to profit. It looks at disenchanting the items that are crafted using uncommon gems, transmuting gems with Alchemy, and just selling the gems directly. You need either Auctionator (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/auctionator.aspx) or AuctionLite (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/auctionlite.aspx)/Auctioneer (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/auctioneer.aspx)/AuctionMaster (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/vendor.aspx) to pull in the prices. Auctionator is recommended. If you are using Auctioneer, you can force the GetAuctionBuyout pricing method by using the toggle command /oc altbuyout.<br />
<br />

<br />
The main screen (opened with /oc) requires you to input a price for each type of ore, and the number or stacks to use when calculating profit. Pressing Do It! will change the calculated values to the type of ore you have selected. Each of the uncommon and rare gems are listed with the expected amount of each gem and the total price for that many gems. A total is displayed at the bottom of the list for just selling the gems on the AH. <br />
<br />
On the right hand side the total from selling enchanting materials gained through crafting items with uncommon gems and disenchanting them along with selling cut rare gems is shown. The third route involves transmuting the uncommon gems into rare gems with optional Transmute Mastery bonus. Rare cut profit is currently just done as an overall percentage rather than looking at the cuts you can craft and selecting the most profitable one. The maximum profit and route to get there is show at the right hand side on the bottom, along with the total cost of the ore. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The disenchant values screen shows the expected amount of enchanting materials and their total values as well as the enchanting route value of each uncommon gem used. An optional modifier allows you to increase the value of the materials further through scroll markup. Keep in mind that the gems used for the Jewelcrafting daily quest (Jasper (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25161/), Nightstone (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25160/), and Zephyrites (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25158/)) are often worth much more gold on the day of the quest due to the demand from lazy Jewelcrafters.<br />
<br />
You can scale the windows with a slider under the Disenchanting Values window (it is not working perfectly yet) and mouse over each gem's name to see the value. Mousing over the total numbers on the right will give you a profit number for each option.<br />
<br />
The addon does not take into account gem transmutes currently, according to the author this is a planned feature. Another possible feature would include looking at your Jewelcrafting skills and basing the rare cuts off of what you can actually cut. Head over the addon comments on Curse to suggest more features!<br />

<br />
<br />
Gz to Method! I'm curious though, what was the nature of the hotfix? what did they &quot;fix&quot; ?<br />
<br />
They stopped the Stolen Power buff from working Rip (dealing 4-5 million damage) and Bane of Doom (dealing around 1.5 million damage).<br />
However, it still works with things that hit fairly hard. Not 5 million, but xaar of Paragon was saying Sunfire still hits for 3.5 million.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard nerfed Bane of Doom, which hit for 1.5 million, and left Sunfire, which can potentially hit for 3.5 million, where is the logic in that?<br />
<br />
You can see in this video it is still working with multi-million damage Combustions. Combustion can't be done nearly as frequently as Rip, but still, I think this whole &quot;Method first legit kill&quot; business is just silly. Nobody can -really- say what the intended fight is (although I doubt this is it right now because it is changing again in Patch 4.0.6).</div></div><hr />

Otherwise he wouldn't go out of his way to spoon-feed all the lesser known nooks and crannies of WoW to tens of thousands of people regularly. -.-<br />
<br />
Edit: That and the things the guy above me said. Now we'll have to deal with an influx of new &quot;AH players&quot; for 4-8 weeks, which is quite annoying, since they don't know the first thing about trading to begin with.</div></div><hr />

That's one dumb mechanic in this fight.. How couldnt they see they'd never be able to balance it among all the dps? Not even remotely! Which will lead to class stacking if course. Just yet another example of weaktard development :[</div></div><hr />

I do have sympathy for the people affected though, I found my own niche shortly after release and more and more people have been discovering it. Thus driving my obscene profits down, made around 100k in less than two weeks which wasn't that bad though.<br />
<br />
But the people who do this actively shouldn't fret, just hold on to your stuff for a few weeks until the new people who get into this are all gone. Due to the high influx the market will crash completely and most of them will lose money instead of make money since they will base their profit calculations on AH prices that will not hold for even a day.<br />
<br />
Well the real AH players will still earn their money, there are so many ways to play the AH so just move over to another method that is not the flavour of the month and come back to this one in a few months when people have given up on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's more of a matter of control, sunfire requires a solar eclipse to use, combustion requires a pyroblast crit to get it rolling. There's a degree of luck required for those, a small degree. Bane of Doom required a warlock to push the button marked &quot;Bane of Doom&quot;. Much easier to control. rip required sitting on 5 combo points, which was irritating, but could be promised for every MC.<br />
<br />
What I'm honestly interested in are some of the heavy nukes that come from specs that no one I've talked to has let near the encounter. I've seen 70k Lava Lash, Templar's Verdict, and Execute crits before. Each of those would require some sort of set up, such as sitting on holy power, but if it interacted with the buff would result in hits in excess of 1.5 million with ease, probably more. But that would also require bringing a ret pally or fury warrior to the fight, which I'm not sure would be worth the science.</div></div><hr />

If it is anything like the other times, a bunch of stupid &quot;omgz I going to get rich now&quot; noobs will try to sell stacks of 5 for stacks of 20 prices and otherwise screw up prices in general for awhile until they all lose heart and give up in a week. <br />
<br />
The sad part about most of these guides is that they don't really work for the non lifers. We have on my server and I am sure all servers are like this people who play WOW all day long. If it wasn't for befriending a few of them my auctions would rarely sell unless I priced them so low as to have the lifers buy them out. I am talking about admitted wake up to play to WOW and go to bed after playing WOW all day types.</div></div><hr />

Unless it has been changed recently, moonkin druids can stay in solar eclipse as long as they want which makes it just as easy to control as rip. Naturally both specs lose dps if they sit at solar eclipse or 5 combo points, respectively, until they get dominated but ferals actually lose more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The amusing thing is, if everyone used an addon for listing their AHs and trusted it to undercut by a few silver, we wouldn't have prices drop like stones from people undercutting by 50%+. Whilst any gold-making frontpage post is going to have an effect, I don't think something like this will. If it turns out buying ores to do whatever is makes gold, then demand for ores rises and therefore their prices. Supply:Demand help a lot to balance things out. If everyone jumps on the money-makers at once, then you'll flood the market.<br />

Gold isn't hard to get this expansion. Hell, I farmed 50k for my sand-drake's mats in just a day of herbing.</div></div><hr />

No, i dont think so. Paragon did kill him 20 days before Method with less good Equip essecially for healers and tanks. So they killed a totally overtuned Boss for their gear with clever use of the Encounter mechanics. Not even Blizzard saw that coming. <br />

<br />
PvP here rewards skill so much that there are complainers on the forums about how they aren't guaranteed a kill when fighting a player 10 levels below, how lowbies ganging up can bring down a high level ganker, or about how tier PvP gear is not making a real difference :) I just love it :)<br />
<br />
Need to see how this will progress, though. In Vanilla WoW there were raids that could actually be completed by a group of really skilled but completely ungeared players (some guilds did that way for the challenge), and if memory serves me up to the late WoW beta there were mechanisms in place to &quot;even up&quot; PvP fights between different level characters. But since the current developers decided that gear needs to be the main drive for players to tackle content - and, thus, decided that gear needs to grant tangible benefits between tiers - gear inflation became so bad a player in the heroic version of the last tier in an expansion can easily have twice the power of a player in the first gear tier of that same expansion.</div></div><hr />

If you blame them entirely on skill you're needlessly beating yourself up (Unless you're in good gear). Realistically, a guy in mostly honor gear is probably gonna beat anyone in less. The bonuses and the amount of resilience will make it very difficult to beat that person unless you have similar or better. Once you have mostly honor gear or better, yeah gear starts playing less of a role; but until you hit that magic point of 4p bonus and 25-30% damage reduction all the skill in the world won't save you from the simple fact that the enemy can do way more damage to you than you can do to him. <br />

Ya, because if Paragon had access to the correct version of the encounter they wouldn't have likely killed it first..........RIGHT............<br />
Paragon is either (A.) marginally better then other top guilds or (B.) puts more time into trying to accomplish world firsts. Either way, they still got the world first, and probably would have gotten it first on an unexploited version. Don't be a hater.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
They stopped the Stolen Power buff from working Rip (dealing 4-5 million damage) and Bane of Doom (dealing around 1.5 million damage).<br />
However, it still works with things that hit fairly hard. Not 5 million, but xaar of Paragon was saying Sunfire still hits for 3.5 million.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard nerfed Bane of Doom, which hit for 1.5 million, and left Sunfire, which can potentially hit for 3.5 million, where is the logic in that?<br />
<br />
You can see in this video it is still working with multi-million damage Combustions. Combustion can't be done nearly as frequently as Rip, but still, I think this whole &quot;Method first legit kill&quot; business is just silly. Nobody can -really- say what the intended fight is (although I doubt this is it right now because it is changing again in Patch 4.0.6).<br />
<br />
I just blame blizzard for having these bugs in the game in the first place. most of their hardest hard mode bosses atramedes, nefarion, lady sinestra, and even cho gall had some serious bug with them they either made the encounter impossible, make it to easy and ignore certain mechanics, or do insane amounts of damage which isn't intended.<br />
<br />
Lady sinestra was truly the worst boss they designed and were pretty much doing beta testing on her with paragon. I understand if a boss encounter had a small bug or something but almost every hard mode boss has had an easy exploit to kill. Very disappointing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the big problem with a lot of these really high end encounters (especially Sinestra which didn't beta at all) is that Blizz lacks internal resources to test them. It's commonly known that a lot of the dev and test teams are players, but I doubt any of them are Paragon level players. When you're dealing with heroic 5 mans, normal mode raids, even some hard modes I'm sure it's easy enough to just give the test team &quot;appropriate&quot; gear and let them play test before releasing even to beta or PTR. When you're dealing with cutting edge content that will take even the best guild a week or two to down, how do you play test it without people of that caliber? <br />
<br />
It's not like they can keep a 25 person team of Paragon level raiders on staff just to play test hard modes.</div></div><hr />

Method's P3 lasted something like 5-6 minutes. That's pretty much insane levels of kiting/healing required...<br />

Paragon's P3 lasted half of that.<br />

<br />
THAT'S how much of a difference in DPS we're looking at, after the fix. Considering NO ONE ELSE has killed heroic Nef since release, I'd say Paragon's strategy basically neutered the fight. <br />

They'll still haven't killed him again either, and who knows how many resets it'll be before anyone else kills him. Right now, I'd say Method has the most illustrious kill for this raid tier, considering only one other heroic Nef kill has been recorded, and it used a shortcut.</div></div><hr />

Yeah okay, JUST NOW in the 76-79 bracket, playing as a 78 Subtelty rogue I am SO OFTEN up against people who seriously spend thousands of gold on 79 greens to be incredibly OP for one level, and in this particular case I Premediate, Shadowstep, Garrote another such rogue in all Cataclysm gear, 5-point Rupture her, Shadow dance to Cheap Shot and Ambush, and as soon as shes out of the stun know what happens?

I don't see why Blizz allows, hell, -favors- such poor sportsmanship like twinking. Why not give a level cap on gems, why not just bring ALL of the gear closer together to avoid people having 14k health and 34k health within FIVE LEVELS OF EACHOTHER? And seriously, an yone who reads this that ever twinked in their life, go impale yourself on the straw end of a broom you cheating overcompensating worthless ghost of a man.</div></div><hr />

I usually don't comment on this stuff, but the cheerleading here is ridiculous. They used an EXPLOIT, not an &quot;encounter mechanic&quot;, and certainly not a &quot;well thought out strategy&quot;. They cheesed it, period. But in the end who cares who got the first kill to be honest? Of course a guild of sponsored gamers will do it before those who don't have the amount of time needed to sink into it to get it done quickly.</div></div><hr />

Except that they DID NOT use an exploit, they used an encounter mechanic and, indeed, what was a well thought-out strategy. This has been explained in detail ad nauseum so I just state the conclusion here. The guild is sponsored, yes, as is every little local backstreet floorball team and such these days.

<br />
Paragon Spent 3:30 in phase three, 3:00 in phase 2, and 3:30 seconds in phase one. <br />
Method spent 3:00 in phase one, 1:50 in phase two, and 5:30 seconds in phase 3.<br />
Method opted to zerg onyxia in phase one, and push right through phase two without forcing any DPS on nefarian. They also spent a good 40 seconds of phase 3 with half their DPS dead. So the damage differential was marginal at best.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Paragon's already killed H Nef again, this is verifiable on setja's armory.</div></div><hr />

Go to the bottom of the page, they list every boss in the instance, and how many times they killed it. Go to Blackwing Decent Heroic, and look at Nefarian. There is a two next to it. L2Armory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paragon Spent 3:30 in phase three, 3:00 in phase 2, and 3:30 seconds in phase one. <br />
Method spent 3:00 in phase one, 1:50 in phase two, and 5:30 seconds in phase 3.<br />
Method opted to zerg onyxia in phase one, and push right through phase two without forcing any DPS on nefarian. They also spent a good 40 seconds of phase 3 with half their DPS dead. So the damage differential was marginal at best.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Paragon's already killed H Nef again, this is verifiable on setja's armory.<br />
eh... wrong wrong wrong!<br />
<br />
We didn't zerg Onyxia in P1. Have you seen our video? <br />
We left Onyxia alive as long as possible (seconds before she wipes raid with electricity). And Paragon couldn't have stayed longer in P1.<br />
<br />
Obviously both guilds have spent the same time in P1 (+- few seconds, before Onyxia wipes raid).<br />
We started P2 with Nefarian at 75%.<br />
Paragon did the same: P2 start with Nefarian at 75%.<br />
<br />
In P2 both guilds zerged Chromatic Prototypes without doing almost any damage to Nefarian.<br />
Our P2 was faster, because we didn't have only blue-geared kittens in raid.<br />
<br />
Both guilds started P3 with Nefarian at 71%.<br />
<br />
According to the videos:<br />
Method spent 5:40 in P3.<br />
Paragon spent 3:30 in P3.<br />
However, it might be faked a bit by video editing.<br />
<br />
Check the recount numbers and say if that seems marginal for you.<br />
Paragon's top 9 kittens: 68k, 43k, 42k, 41k, 40k, 35k, 30k, 27k, 25k<br />
Method's top 8 dps: .... 36k, 29k, 27k, 27k, 23k, 22k, 22k, 21k,</div></div><hr />

I did watch both vids, that's where the timing came from. Paragon split DPS to hold onyxia's lightning charge down 30 seconds longer than you did. You went hard burn on onyxia, dropped her to around 10%, went hard burn on nefarian until Onyxia's lightning charge came close to maxing out, then kicked onyxia over. The lightning charge builds faster the less DPS you have on onyxia.<br />
<br />
I'm talking a matter of total raid DPS. Comparing their top nine to your top 8 is skewing the facts, plain and simple.</div></div><hr />

Well, we had higher dps in p1+p2.<br />
Paragon had much higher dps in p3. <br />
They burned the boss from 70% to 0% in 3:30.<br />
We burned him from 70% to 0% in 5:40.<br />
60% more dps.<br />
Ofc few people died at the end in Method's kill, but still the difference in huge.</div></div><hr />
