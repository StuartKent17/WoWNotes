Warlords of Draenor - Developer Interviews<br />
There were a few developer interviews recently, so today we are taking a look at an interview from BlizzPro (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CG53OjeStw) with Holinka, Kris Zierhut, and Steve Burke.<br />
<br />
Level 90 Boost and Proving Grounds<br />
<br />
You won't be able to queue for Heroic Dungeons or LFR until you have a certain level of Proving Ground achievements.<br />
In a patch after release, Proving Grounds will be made to do a better job of telling you what you are doing wrong, rather than just being a test.<br />
Players that don't have Proving Ground achievements will still be able to go into normal dungeons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Questing<br />
<br />
The Jade Forest quests had a very clear story, but it also had a lot of side quests that could bog you down. <br />
In Warlords of Draenor, your map will show you where to go to continue the main storyline, along with the locations of bonus objectives. <br />
The bonus objectives no longer have any story text that go with them, just a list of objectives. Now when there is quest text, you will know that it is really worth reading.<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
<br />
After rescuing members of the Frostwolf Clan in the Warlords intro quest experience, Durotan will give you a plot of land. This is where you start building your garrison. <br />
After you complete their quests, some questgivers will be available for you to recruit as a follower for your garrison.<br />
You will be redirected to your garrison frequently throughout the leveling experience, as it is integrated into the zones and leveling experience. Every time you go back, you will see familiar faces from your questlines.<br />
Garrisons offer lots of hard choices that give you nice rewards, such as the buildings you choose for your limited plots. Buildings and followers aren't a permanent choice though, so if you change your mind you can change things out.<br />
As you go out and adventure in the world and irritate the enemies in Draenor, they will attack your garrison. You and your followers will need to fend off these attacks. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ashran<br />
<br />
Ashran will have a big central battle that is pushing towards the other faction's base. <br />
Around the outer edges of Ashran you can find some rares and other things similar to Timeless Isle, with greater rewards to be found on the opposite faction's side of the zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
There are a lot of advantages to having a realm community, so there aren't any plans to allow players to join guilds on any realm.<br />
When you log in to Warlords of Draenor, you should be able to play with your friends. Allowing cross realm raiding and the changes to raid locks are one way the team is working towards this goal.<br />
The team is still talking about a good reward system for completing older content with scaling, but there aren't any announcements for now. The Level 90 boost allows you to play with your friends without needing to level through the older dungeons now, making it less urgent. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4.7 Hotfixes - April 14<br />
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
Siege of Orgrimmar: Blackfuse Bombling should no longer be incorrectly awarded from the Spoils of Pandaria encounter.<br />
Icecrown Citadel: Resolved an issue that could prevent players from being able to loot The Lich King if NPCs dealt fatal damage to him.<br />
The Eye: Added additional safeguards to the Kael'thas Sunstrider encounter to address issues that could cause him to sometimes not grant loot if he's defeated too quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
Insane in the Membrane: Resolved an issue where Exalted status with the various Steamwheedle Cartel factions, as well as Honored status with the Bloodsail Buccaneers faction, were not properly being credited if those reputations subsequently decreased. Players should now be able to earn this achievement if they have ever brought those five reputations to the required levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Is there any difference for &quot;melee range&quot; for EnhShaman vs FeralDruid? Just my misperception? Shaman seems to hit from farther.<br />
Nope. Same range. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449605236689100800))<br />
<br />
Wait, so if you have 100% uptime on your dot until the mob dies u never get the partial ticks?<br />
You get the duration of it. Partial ticks are the 'remainder'. It's like saying you get 6.2 ticks per cast. If you just... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449263495129751552))<br />
...cast it once, you get 6 ticks and a 0.2 partial tick. If you chain 9 of them together, you get 55 ticks and a 0.8 partial (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449263800068235264))<br />
or did I misread and the duration per cast just keeps increasing by the partial amount with ticks always at fixed intervals?<br />
Duration per cast remains fixed; doesn't change with haste. That's the point. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449272666185138176))<br />
ok I think the part I was not getting was this extra damage is handled on refresh of the dot. Correct? Thank you for the replies<br />
The extra damage is a constant thing. Haste makes your DoTs tick faster, but doesn't change their duration. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449279937346682880))<br />
And with enough clip-chaining will 'partial' ticks ever become an extra 'full' normal tick, or are they...<br />
Perhaps this will help: don't think of DoTs as doing X ticks. Think of them ticking at Y rate for X sec. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449606529772044288))<br />
<br />
will channels have partial ticks too? (sorry if that got asked before)<br />
No; channels get shorter with haste, just as before. Channels are more like cast times with partial credit. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449653731152257024))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Is there going to be an update to the race dances? Aka. longer and smoother?<br />
not longer, but with new rigging and animation clean up - dances should feel smoother. (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/448539093954088960))<br />
<br />
You mean model? That is pretty much certain. There will be winged arakkoa, which already necessitates new one<br />
new Arakkoa model for sure, not definite on Kaliri - it's on wish list right now. (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/448540125199228930))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
Wait...does Multistrike not trigger on SEF hits? Like you would do it, but your clones wouldn't?<br />
Your SEF clones can multistrike, independently from you. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/448920331017674752))<br />
So we have 3x chance to multistrike, but for 1/3rd the damage. Evens out in long run.<br />
Well, they're separate units. You could Blackout Kick, which your clone would mimic, and it may multistrike for clone, but not you. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/448921085036093441))<br />
Okay: Clarify please: 5.4: SEF clones multistrike or not? (I understand they will in 6.0)<br />
I don't believe they do, but should be easy for you to test. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/448922836086689793))<br />
<br />
Do you think making Mulistrike a tank stat is going to be a problem? 25 people rolling on the same BIS Ring, Neck, Cloak =/= fun<br />
There won't be 25 people rolling on the same Ring, Neck, or Cloak. Tanks want Bonus Armor and Healers want Spirit, for example. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449239645277003776))<br />
<br />
Your assumptions are wrong. It's not that skewed. Budget-wise, 0.3% Crit = 1.0% Multistrike. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449264285126885376))<br />
Also, while PvE/PvP crit 200/150 crit multi 160/130 balance w/ each other, PvP they devalue vs haste or readiness, no?<br />
You're misunderstanding the PvP vs PvE difference of Multistrike. Same average, more consistent, in PvP. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449272444327432192))<br />
Well you'd know better than me so I'll take your word for it Any news on if/how Multistrike will interact with Healing??<br />
It will, just as with damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449273483973779456))<br />
<br />
Can an ele shaman's overload trigger a multistrike? Can a multistrike trigger an overload?<br />
Yes. No. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449605322835914752))<br />
Do multistrikes get a visual spell animation like overloads do? Would be fun to be a lightning bolt machine gun<br />
Yep. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449616822120116224))<br />
<br />
can multistrikes crit? and would getting A fireball crit followed by a Fireball Multistrike Crit proc Pyroblast!...?<br />
Yes. No. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449667521289785344))<br />
<br />
Thanks for the answer. So would death strike MS trigger the effects twice?<br />
Nope. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449670718372859904))<br />
<br />
How does multistrike appear in the combat log? As &quot;Multistrike&quot; or the spell that triggered it?<br />
As the spell that triggered it:You Fireball Murloc for 100.You Fireball Murloc for 30. (Multistrike) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449607688687591424))<br />
How does multistrike interact with talents/passives that proc off abilities? Lava Surge, FDCL, Spell Reflected stuff?<br />
Ones that can trigger from multistrikes will call it out specifically. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449667631230885888))<br />
Deathstrike won't heal twice off of MS? So what is the benefit to a blood dk? Seems bad.<br />
There are other (better) benefits. It's not bad. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449678682081075201))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Curious if devs feel WoW has become too difficult to play at endgame for the average player? A need to do &quot;homework&quot; to play.<br />
We don't think so. No matter what we do, perfect performance will require extra effort. Takes less than before to do 90%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/449031499061280768))<br />
<br />
If healing won't be more difficult, how will more cast time on more heal not be more difficult. Like Thok HC?<br />
Thok wouldn't exist in its current form. We design encounters to fit players' toolsets. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448484028279029762))<br />
<br />
Does &quot;no more dynamic difficulty swapping&quot; mean no skipping mythic bosses by dropping down to heroic?<br />
Yes, each difficulty will be a self-contained experience. But with less linear layouts, you can choose somewhat. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448483198293377024))<br />
Depending on raid layout, understood. Still loot only once per lockout per boss at the Heroic/Mythic level?<br />
Yeah, loot once per lockout. Heroic and Mythic are separate lockouts; Mythic is a fixed ID like Heroic is today. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448484978662207489))<br />
<br />
flex N/H going live at WoD or 6.0? Roster realigns suddenly places us at needing to test how some ppl's PC can handle 20 man.<br />
6.0. There will be a few weeks of 20-player Mythic SoO (along with flexible N/H) before Draenor unlocks. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448536775061811200))<br />
You guys are fully retuning all of the current-tier raids to be compatible with class changes in 6.0? (Or only heroic/mythic?)<br />
Siege of Orgrimmar, all difficulties. Prior zones aren't changing in structure or tuning, but they're trivialized by gear. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448538887359832066))<br />
<br />
No loot from bosses in 8 weeks.. Hope you won't call me a liar after 10+. Is this your idea of loot progression in WoD?<br />
No loot at all, or just not the specific items you need? We do have plans to limit the impact of bad luck streaks like that. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448740540465422336))<br />
<br />
Leader can change loot option in combat when boss is low hp in order to take the loot to himself. Plans to stop this behavior?<br />
Yes. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448843551250452480))<br />
<br />
I get that, just thought old content would be added to the new system.<br />
Old raids were built around the other system; not a trivial conversion, and the time is better spent on new content. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448865884098945024))<br />
<br />
Why is that? Also, I've noticed old lockouts don't always work the new way, such as Kara. Intended?<br />
That's how raid lockouts have worked literally since Molten Core. &quot;Flexible&quot; lockouts added in Cata, for Normal mode. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448864832364609536))<br />
And the &quot;Why&quot; was more &quot;why not include heroic in the new awesomeness?&quot; Like, what made you (the team) hold back?<br />
Flexible locks permit loot abuse by organized groups. System makes it easier to PUG, but that's not the audience MoP Heroic raids. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448866251805192192))<br />
<br />
Any chance on revisiting KT in Tempest Keep? Perma-cc is pretty annoying. KT never heard of DR<br />
There are mechanics in the fight to help with that. The goal isn't to make old fights trivial to solo; just doable. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/449202567046635523))<br />
<br />
What will happen to the CM teleport spells after they're removed?<br />
Like other rewards, players who earned those teleport spells will retain them. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/449228698944684033))<br />
<br />
Why are realm first CM titles character specific instead of account-wide?<br />
Because they reflect a skilled accomplishment with a specific class; same reason Gladiator titles aren't account-wide. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/449589470690422784))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
1. We'll keep an eye on the number of CC breaks in the game throughout beta. The widespread complaint was too much crowd control. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/448596181975711746))<br />
If no one is dying because crowd control is ineffective, it's an issue. Often those breaks support a specific class kit. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/448596324120666112))<br />
2. RBG cap is higher than arena cap. Source of major complaint and we aren't really happy with that system from a readability angle (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/448596551300960258))<br />
There are few things in the game as complicated as rating and conquest cap calculations. Should be simpler. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/448596747808296961))<br />
3. Not really sure about what you mean by tremor totem + totem reset. Call of the Elements? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/448597594415984640))<br />
<br />
ever thought about an underwater BG?<br />
I think it would be awful and don't ever plan on making one. Floating combat is not fun. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449246520928264192))<br />
What if the game focuses on it? Aren't spaceship games (e.g. Wing Commander) basically floating combat?<br />
But you're forced to always be moving forward. I do think those games suffer from everyone flying around in circles though. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449249496078118912))<br />
Well, many of them allow you to full-stop, but point taken. Sense of scale/movement/strategy is tricky in wide open 3D.<br />
I think the average player can get very disoriented in a space game. It's helpful to have a horizon line. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449251269635342336))<br />
<br />
Wouldn't pvp be better if all the addons were disabled? I feel kind of cheated for not using them. Some maybe don't know them.<br />
It depends on perspective but macros and addons have value. It's a way to tinker with your setup and improve performance. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449308921576964096))<br />
<br />
About Ashran, due to the limited players of RP-PVP servers, will we see people from PVP servers too? Please, don't want empty zone.<br />
Possibly. We'll try to avoid it if possible. We'll see what the numbers look like. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449568014564732929))<br />
<br />
if eu has majority of players pvping as ally and the new nerf to horde and buffs to ally wont it mean horde are a dying breed n pvp<br />
I doubt it. Globally the Horde is overrepresented. High end arena players just tend to all pick one side to be together. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449568372896702466))<br />
<br />
PvPers would most likely sacrafice a bit of lore for quicker same-faction BGs. <br />
Just to be abundantly clear, same faction BGs is not on the table. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449568919003467776))<br />
<br />
What about allowing free, or half off, transfers from Horde to Alliance (only) to help the imbalance and queue times?<br />
it's something we're exploring. It is A LOT more complicated than you'd think. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449632409655312384))<br />
<br />
Hey! Will it be possible to use [Alliance/Horde Battle Standard] in the new PvP zone Ashran?<br />
There will be an Ashran specific version (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/449685155028824064))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Any chance Spirits of Harmony ever become BoA or BoE? Don't see what the harm would be in making it so in 6.0.<br />
No harm in 6.0? I agree. Maybe even a little earlier. (hwoome (https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/449606490731462656))<br />
<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
Has to be TRULY different though, like leveling thru PvP vs LFD vs questing. Remember lesson from Golden Lotus dailies!<br />
5.1-5.4 let us try out various things, 5.1 had great story unlock, 5.2 had epic treasure/raid fit, 5.4 gameplay/items (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/448682832479539200))<br />
<br />
World<br />
And try to make rare mobs really rare, please. On TI, mainly, they are like the grass/ruppes on Zelda games.<br />
Rarer mob can have higher drop chance, but less chance of you seeing it. What's ideal for you levelling/endgame? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/449321573858541568))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
I noticed a &quot;Dance Studio&quot; on a picture of the garrison UI. Care to shed some light on its purpose? Moral?<br />
Just the UI guys having a little fun Not to say that there won't be dancing with your troops... (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/448681579519295488))<br />
<br />
How mandatory will garrisons be? They do NOT interest me at all. I'm starting to worry they won't be optional content.<br />
Do you consider the farm mandatory? Why or why not? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/449321854700761088))<br />
Doesn't garrison have something to do with professions? Sounds more mandatory than farm's cooking items.<br />
What elements of your professions are a &quot;must do&quot; for you? Does that change over the course of the expac? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/449323858550484992))<br />
<br />
Can we rearrange buildings after we built it for garrisons?<br />
Yep, this was in the Blizzcon Q+A (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/449365514725257216))<br />
<br />

Wow I was hoping that would be the opposite. People in LFR are fucking retards compared to people in heroic dungeons, and they literally never improve as the tier goes on. Heroic Dungeons at least get easier as the expansion goes on. There better be a way to queue up for proving grounds.</div></div><hr />

I went 3 months doing nothing but celestials and ordos and got one pvp piece using coins every week. Hence why im taking a break until WoD because i could care less about doing the same shit over and over for another 3-5 months especially when i'm not getting anything out of it.

I'm quite glad about this. It's rather maniacal that the only thing preventing some people from entering is iLvl. I have to wonder if it's character specific or account wide. I'd prefer character specific so that you can't just run in and faceroll the PG with a certain class and then shit everywhere when you go in as the #1 retard. Sure it'll be tedious to get every character through. But I personally don't care.<br />
<br />
<br />
Players that don't have Proving Ground achievements will still be able to go into normal dungeons.<br />
This is where I bring it into question again as to whether or not it's account-wide. Most achievements are account wide, but I suppose that doesn't mean you'll necessarily have credit to enter in Heroic Dungeons / LFR.</div></div><hr />

The team is still talking about a good reward system for completing older content with scaling, but there aren't any announcements for now. The Level 90 boost allows you to play with your friends without needing to level through the older dungeons now, making it less urgent. <br />
<br />
How often will they use that excuse? XP nerfs are not urgent because we got level 90 boost. Making leveling fun is not urgent because we got level 90 boost.<br />
Those leveling perks, which I assume are only going to be implemented for level 90 to 100, also shows they let the 1-90 leveling experience be for what it is... because, I am guessing, the level 90 boost allows you to play with friends and skip it anyway.<br />
<br />
Strip that baby down more to cut costs... :/. &quot;We remove 90% of the talents because this way it is easier to balance.&quot; &quot;Oh, and these are also more &quot;fun&quot; and are &quot;real&quot; choices.&quot;<br />
<br />
90-100 leveling better be really amazing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a long time player, who already have an established social circle, I am a bit disappointed by this. I do understand their reasoning, but I've ended up in a situation where this is seriously messing up my ingame social interaction.<br />
<br />
I have created my own horde of alts on the realm where I've always had my main character. The problem is, I started playing during vanilla, and I have exactly zero stable friends left on this server. They have either quit, or transfered server. A handfull of my long time friends all changed to the same server, and joined the same guild. I created an alt on their server to better keep in touch, and eventually grew in to knowing more people in this guild. The problem is, my entire character progression is stuck on my original server(I see my alts as a part of my character progression, as they support eachother through professions and roles), alongside friends that occationally log back on, but are no longer reliable as playmates. They aren't reliable anymore, as it takes a while between each time they log on, and we rarely end up with active accounts, or just being online, at the same time anymore. Because of this, I do play a lot more with the people on the server where that tiny group of friends went. That's the only place I get social interaction, but logging on to their server, seriously halts my character progression. It feel like I am wasting my time playing the alts I have over there, which is seriously demotivating. I simply wish I could have their guildchat, while soloing on my original server, and joining the occational group with them through RealID.<br />
<br />
Transfering everything I have already created, over to that other server, is not an option. It would cost a serious amount of money(got 10 high level characters there), and further punishment would be an ever bigger distance to those of my friends that are still there, just not as active anymore. I also have my son and my bf on my original server, aswell as my bf's best friend, which he does 50% of the solo content with. I'd basicly have to drag with me those 3 aswell, and the transfer cost of two os those, would be on my(our) economy aswell as my own 10 characters. No chance that is gonna happen.<br />
<br />
Make new friends? New friends show up from time to time, but I am not gonna &quot;replace&quot; everyone I already have just because the game doesn't support my social situation. I don't know about others, but there's a limit to how many people I can have a stable and regular relationship with.<br />
<br />
So yeah, I really wish guilds could be cross-realm aswell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is this lazy? If, anything, it varies the questing experience. I see some potential - IF blizzard implements this way.<br />
<br />
Eg. You go into a field of bears to kill some bears and 1 big bear. You could get 1 or 2 of these random quests<br />
<br />
Bonus quest: Collect 10 Bear asses<br />
<br />
Bonus quest 2: Kill 10 bears in 1 minute<br />
<br />
Bonus quest 3: Collect 1 trap and use it to trap a bear and escort it to NPC<br />
<br />
Bonus quest 4 a1: Save gnome from being eaten up by big bear<br />
<br />
Bonus quest 4 a2: recruit saved gnome for garrison<br />
<br />
Bonus quest 4 b: Watch gnome being eaten by big bear and see what happens next <br />
<br />
Bonus quest 5 [PVP]: Kill 1 Opposing faction player who is also probably looking for bear asses<br />
<br />
Bonus quest 6 [Skinning]: Skin 5 bears for your Garrison <br />
<br />
Bonus quest 7: [Random spawned quest item] Bring this tainted bear ass to some npc. <br />
<br />
So i dont see all quest needing text.<br />
<br />
Some of these quests could be dailies as well, when you zone into the area. It makes content more dynamic.<br />

<br />
I am worried it will be called optional like the farm in MoP. But that farm rewarded so much gold, consumables and crafted gear and it only took 5 minutes to harvest and plant. It was just ridiculously efficient to make it popular (it didn't feel optional to me). I think they will do the same thing with Garissons because you can't spend so much time and effort into a feature and constantly remind us of it to then make it completely optional so barely anyone uses it. I for one wouldn't have planted so many crops on my farm if it didn't generate so much gold for minimum effort. Unless ofcourse it is actually so much fun that players shift more away from raids/dungeons to garissons which might be a bad thing...</div></div><hr />

The exact level to be agreed between us and 3% of the playerbase we consider it worthwhile to develop content for. You will keep paying us anyway, so suck it up.<br />

In a patch after release, Proving Grounds will be made to do a better job of telling you what you are doing wrong, rather than just being a test.<br />

Dead realms with no guilds to raid with are amoung our best income generators. You will keep paying us anyway, so suck it up.<br />

<br />
The Level 90 boost allows you to play with your friends without needing to level through the older dungeons now, making it less urgent.<br />

Fixing what we devastated in Cata would take actual programming and design skills, not to mention time we could use writing even more spiteful Aprils Fools &quot;notes&quot;.<br />
You're getting garrison NPCs able to dance with you instead and of course, you can always pay us extra money for never getting actual fixes to what we've broken. You will keep paying us anyway, so suck it up.<br />

If you can't handle a Proving Ground, then you can't handle the H.Dungeon which means I don't want you in the group to begin with. <br />

its not about not being able to &quot;handle it&quot;, and your condsecending attitude speaks volumes about you btw, its about putting weird gates onto content. I've never needed a proving ground previously, I've never had a need to require others to take a test, and lets face it, proving ground are not a good example of group play anyway.<br />
<br />
And if you really think garissons are optional, go read the information again, its sounding pretty damm compulsory to me no matter how much they say its optional, like they tired with daily quests in 5.1......yeah that was a load of BS then as well.</div></div><hr />

The people giving them aren't really important, but it's good to know that there are more people in the world than those who are going to be connected to big events.<br />
<br />
And <br />
<br />
<br />
I cant imagine an RPG without quest texts. But... i think its because i am to old and most of the teenage games will like it. <br />
I believe its not that hard to make some text to the side quests. The text of the quests = lore.<br />
<br />
Exactly this. Side quests added flavor to the game, a lot of it, even if they were a bit mindless at times. Now they will literally, be mindless. Remove spice from a dish and what does it become? Bland.</div></div><hr />

i disagree, i like lore and reading and fantasy and all that nerd shit. however, i don't read quests in this game because i cant be fucked to know the lore around collecting 15 cow pies. if those quests don't have an essay written about them but the cool ones about orcs smashing up the place do i'm more inclined to start reading quests again, giving me more immersion.<br />

So I'm seeing where they said bonus objectives will show up with no additional context other than that of the quest they're a part of, but am I missing the part where they said the same about side quests or are people just pulling this out of thin air?</div></div><hr />

Assuming the new proving grounds will be anything like the current, you'd need to be rather bad at your class to not be able to get silver. There is a difference between an attunement that requires getting a raid together, and one that requires you putting bare minimum effort into your character for 10 minutes.<br />

There literally aren't going to be side quests. Blizz even pointed out Jade Forest as an example of what they're trying to avoid (how there are multiple side quests).<br />
<br />
Imagine Jade Forest, where the only questline is entering as your faction, getting their forces setup with the Jinyu/Hozen, then having the fight at the Jade Serpent statue.<br />
<br />
Or if the only questline in Krassarang was aiding the night elves/tauren, then fixing the red crane temple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After rescuing members of the Frostwolf Clan in the Warlords intro quest experience, Durotan will give you a plot of land. This is where you start building your garrison.<br />
After you complete their quests, some questgivers will be available for you to recruit as a follower for your garrison.<br />
You will be redirected to your garrison frequently throughout the leveling experience, as it is integrated into the zones and leveling experience. Every time you go back, you will see familiar faces from your questlines.<br />
Garrisons offer lots of hard choices that give you nice rewards, such as the buildings you choose for your limited plots. Buildings and followers aren't a permanent choice though, so if you change your mind you can change things out.<br />
As you go out and adventure in the world and irritate the enemies in Draenor, they will attack your garrison. You and your followers will need to fend off these attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How mandatory will garrisons be? They do NOT interest me at all. I'm starting to worry they won't be optional content.<br />
Do you consider the farm mandatory? Why or why not? (Muffinus)<br />
<br />
How... How is this even remotely similar to the method they took with farming? You could completely skip the Farm quests. There was absolutely zero need to do them. Garrisons appear to be completely mandatory, insomuch as it's part of the intro quest. Then you get re-directed there as you level? Gah!<br />
<br />
I have zero desire to play &quot;house&quot;. Blizzard has been historically very good at making new features optional to the core game. Whether it be BGs, Arenas, Farms, Pet Battles, what have you. If they are of interest to you, you are free to enjoy. They've never shoved it onto the player like this though. <br />
<br />
I've pre-purchased so I'll definitely be giving it a try, but this is just baffling.</div></div><hr />

I've never needed a proving ground previously, I've never had a need to require others to take a test, and lets face it, proving ground are not a good example of group play anyway.<br />
<br />
And if you really think garissons are optional, go read the information again, its sounding pretty damm compulsory to me no matter how much they say its optional, like they tired with daily quests in 5.1......yeah that was a load of BS then as well.<br />
<br />
On a side note, after scoring the Gold Damage I still have no doubt whatsoever about PG experience having anything to do with any actual group content. The two are completely separate and no level of skill in doing PG implies anything about handling any actual group content, especially challenging group content.<br />
<br />
There is one and one function only they might really serve: give some extra epeen to pathetic creatures who suck horribly at Life but can optimize their way of playing a video game in a manner not perceived as worthwhile by most others and not really useful outside a very local context.

What I hate most is that PG for DDs is mostly about dishing out single target burst damage and very limited movement and no teamplay. That has not much to do with the job a shadow usually does in any type of raid or dungeon. Not to mention that people change skills and dress just for the PG...which says all about how realistic it is.<br />
That aside I think some gating is fine...however I think it should be somewhere between current bronze and silver. Heroics will be outgeared within a month anyway...and for serious challenge we have the CM.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, so much of a rotation on my DW Frost DK I almost lost my way twice. Duh.<br />
I pull ~220-240 on Ordos on my hunt (550, cape, flex crossbow) with castbars gone from the screen and 5fps at best (still, ElvUI is too useful for me everywhere else and 200 is more than enough with full group, so well, I'll just keep killing the cow without castbars). When I was trying Gold Damage on the same toon with smooth play of non-group content, I just couldn't kill that last big Sha, no matter what I poured in the burn phase.<br />
So much about PG serving as a check on my execution of rotation.<br />
<br />
<br />

Yeah, so much crap to get out of in Damage trial. Died 10 times to bananas, then I suddenly realized what the ice chains on Stone Guard do! Oh you mean the amber? Yeah it sure taught me to... play another game. Oh no, wait! There are them bombs in Siege of Niuzao Temple that have some remote indirect resemblance to PG ambers so I guess this is a great school of dungeon running skills.<br />
It's very useful!!!<br />
Oh, you mean tank trial maybe? Too bad crap on the ground in actual group content punishes everyone, not just tanks. And god save you if you start thinking floor fire always kills adds too.<br />
<br />
<br />
It means you know more than your average LFRer.<br />
Nothing you can learn in PG will prevent an LFR wipe. If 12 of the 17 dps pull extremely low numbers, it might help if you and 4 others go 200+. What wipes LFR groups is ignoring or simply not knowing the fights, not understanding what the target marks are for and so on. Nobody will learn any of that in PG.<br />
<br />
What dps PG taught me was how to tailor gear for PG in order to get through gold without too much pain (I might still have gotten it wrong if sha-touched gems really don't work there). Silver tank trial I did in my usual LFR gear taught me nothing at all and bore no semblance to any real content. Not overly interested in doing gold tank - a slightly improved target dummy exercise is not reason enough to change either my gear (again) or my talents.<br />
<br />
Going to sources OUTSIDE the game in order to learn stuff useful exclusively INSIDE the game is something I do anyway, but if people have to go to some external 3rd party websites in order to learn stuff that happens in WoW, then something is deeply wrong with WoW, not with people.<br />
<br />
I am levelling a healer now. Not even thinking about taking healer PG, not after following my GF's progress on that crap and her comments comparing how different healspecs perform in there.</div></div><hr />

See:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Jade Forest quests had a very clear story, but it also had a lot of side quests that could bog you down.<br />
In Warlords of Draenor, your map will show you where to go to continue the main storyline, along with the locations of bonus objectives.<br />
<br />
They begin by saying the Jade Forest gets bogged down with side quests. IE: Stuff like the Tian Monastary, or the side quest with the brewfather ghosts that didn't relate to the main quest.<br />
<br />
They then say they are focusing on the main storyline coupled with bonus objectives. In other words, they are getting ride of &quot;side quests that could bog you down&quot; and replacing them with &quot;bonus objectives&quot;.<br />

Here's the thing. You know what you are doing. The entire point in requiring people to get PV silver is to prove they know what they are doing. Of course you find it redundant: you already know what you need to do. <br />
<br />
That, and about your GF: Healing specs dont start to suffer in PV till gold rank. Getting silver is fairly simple. Base competency is all silver requires. This isn't about completing the somewhat poorly done gold PV. Its Silver, which is absolutely nothing but base competency. If you can't clear silver PV, then you have no business being in LFR, since you won't do anything but drag everyone down with your blatant incompetence.</div></div><hr />

Nothing wrong with having to know a tiny bit of how to play your class properly before joining groups so you don't waste peoples time, this will probably take like 10 mins for any player with half a brain, not like you need to spend hours grinding rep or getting a group together for 2/3 specific heroic dungeons..<br />

The only people that would be worried are the terrible players that make LFR and some heroics a nightmare and even then it will probably be easy enough for them to do it or put a tiny bit of effort in for a few mins before going back to being terrible/lazy.</div></div><hr />

Thats my point. Some people DONT learn these things. This isn't a difficult concept. If you know them, you spend all of ten minutes in the PV to show you know your class. If you don't know how to play your class, you won't pass the PV. When I did proving grounds, I marched in as a fury spec and had finished silver with zero difficulty because I actually knew how to play my class. On the other hand, people in my guild were struggling with it, and sure enough, they were the sorts who push half as much DPS as they should be in their gear.</div></div><hr />

Yes? I'm not sure what you are getting at here... The closest in game comparison I can think of is the Farm. It was completely skipable. There was absolutely no need to do anything with it if that was your choice. Everything about Garrisons as described seems to indicate that this isn't the case. You are being forced to engage in it, and then it appears that you will be brought back to continue your Garrisoning as you level.<br />
<br />
How is this idiotic. How is my preference idiotic? How is wanting a feature that I have no desire to engage in not be mandatory idiotic?<br />
<br />
Yes. Plenty of people like this feature. That's wonderful! I am happy for them, and unlike some, not calling people that have different views idiotic... Some people like Pet Battles. Great! I don't, but great for them. Some people loved the Farm. Not me, but hurray for people who did! The difference is that these are optional. Completely. The main story did not drive you through these. IF you so desired, you need not touch either one. At all. Can you say the same of garrisons?<br />
<br />
I have no idea why you are hostile about people stating what they do and do not want to see. If you want to enjoy Garrisons, go right ahead! I'm not trying to stop you. But. They. Are. Not. For. Me.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, people in leveling dungeons I think are actually retarded. Most the time if i'm not a dps leveling I wont even do them.</div></div><hr />

The closest in game comparison I can think of is the Farm. It was completely skipable. There was absolutely no need to do anything with it if that was your choice. Everything about Garrisons as described seems to indicate that this isn't the case. You are being forced to engage in it, and then it appears that you will be brought back to continue your Garrisoning as you level.<br />
<br />
How is this idiotic. How is my preference idiotic? How is wanting a feature that I have no desire to engage in not be mandatory idiotic?<br />
<br />
Yes. Plenty of people like this feature. That's wonderful! I am happy for them, and unlike some, not calling people that have different views idiotic... Some people like Pet Battles. Great! I don't, but great for them. Some people loved the Farm. Not me, but hurray for people who did! The difference is that these are optional. Completely. The main story did not drive you through these. IF you so desired, you need not touch either one. At all. Can you say the same of garrisons?<br />
<br />
I have no idea why you are hostile about people stating what they do and do not want to see. If you want to enjoy Garrisons, go right ahead! I'm not trying to stop you. But. They. Are. Not. For. Me.<br />
<br />
It only leads you there during leveling. Since its part of leveling, you won't need to take part in it past the leveling experience. It's about as &quot;required&quot; as doing questlines, and certainly wont be required at all for PvP, PvE, or really anything else but questing.<br />
<br />
Think of it as a &quot;Go to X, get quest&quot; quest. Since that is pretty much exactly what it is. You may as well get mad about Jade Forest being &quot;mandatory&quot;, since that is essentially what you're doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it isn't that, not at least from the info I've gleaned. Sure when leveling you hit the Jade Forest and completed quests. Same as always. That's par for the course.<br />
<br />
But Garrisons take out of the realm of pure questing, and put you into something of a mini RTS. Suddenly you need to recruit followers, gather resources, &quot;level&quot; buildings, handle attacks and counter attacks. This is less about a hero questing in a new world and finding glory, and more like playing a game of base commander.<br />
<br />
Again, my argument is a simple one: If you like the concept, awesome! Enjoy! But some of us (and hey, maybe I'm in the absolute minority, I have no idea) just don't want to play this game within a game. It's the fact that you seem to have no choice that bugs me. I'm sorry if you don't understand that, but the reality is that this is the first time Blizzard has implemented a feature in this manner, and I'm not a fan.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you need to actually take part in those aspects of the Garrison. If you did, that would mean you would need to reach a certain point in your Garrison's progress before you could progress through questing. That is to say, its not going to be like &quot;Level a stable to 3 or else you can't continue&quot;, or &quot;Find X person to continue&quot;, they won't have those aside from being framed as a quest. That is to say, the recruitment garrison quest will be &quot;Find the important person&quot;, which is no different from a normal quest.</div></div><hr />

Silver proving grounds is hardly hardcore mate, I think silver is a bit low tbh, anyone who cant reach such a low standard is going to inflict pain on their group and needs to spend at least a few minutes learning what the buttons do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Occasionally I do take the time to get into it and read the text though, and invariably I find it more enjoyable than mechanical questing. Unfortunately it's also much more time-consuming, and there are conflicting goals at work: Getting to 90 as quickly as possible, and Not hating life in the process. It's a balance.</div></div><hr />

The two are completely separate and no level of skill in doing PG implies anything about handling any actual group content, especially challenging group content.<br />
<br />
There is one and one function only they might really serve: give some extra epeen to pathetic creatures who suck horribly at Life but can optimize their way of playing a video game in a manner not perceived as worthwhile by most others and not really useful outside a very local context. That's some elite indeed, lol.<br />
<br />
Thats plainly not true. Anyone who fails silver proving grounds cant play that class yet. No biggie, doesnt mean theyre a bad person. Does mean they need to make some kind of effort to learn before going into a dungeon and learning while wiping. <br />
<br />
Skill in PG obviously carries over to group content, and the converse, to say otherwise is just saying white is black...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cptaylor38</div><div class="date">2014-04-15, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is this lazy? If, anything, it varies the questing experience. I see some potential - IF blizzard implements this way.<br />
<br />
Eg. You go into a field of bears to kill some bears and 1 big bear. You could get 1 or 2 of these random quests<br />
<br />
Bonus quest: Collect 10 Bear asses<br />
<br />
Bonus quest 2: Kill 10 bears in 1 minute<br />
<br />
Bonus quest 3: Collect 1 trap and use it to trap a bear and escort it to NPC<br />
<br />
Bonus quest 4 a1: Save gnome from being eaten up by big bear<br />
<br />
Bonus quest 4 a2: recruit saved gnome for garrison<br />
<br />
Bonus quest 4 b: Watch gnome being eaten by big bear and see what happens next <br />
<br />
Bonus quest 5 [PVP]: Kill 1 Opposing faction player who is also probably looking for bear asses<br />
<br />
Bonus quest 6 [Skinning]: Skin 5 bears for your Garrison <br />
<br />
Bonus quest 7: [Random spawned quest item] Bring this tainted bear ass to some npc. <br />
<br />
So i dont see all quest needing text.<br />
<br />
Some of these quests could be dailies as well, when you zone into the area. It makes content more dynamic.<br />
<br />
[Am a tad lazy but you can copy/paste this on US/EU forms or pass it to the wow devs if you want :P]<br />
<br />
<br />
Their whole argument for removing flying is that they don't want to destroy immersion.<br />
<br />
So they remove quest text from even minor quests that are the only way of creating anykind of immersion for them? &quot;We don't want you to skip by every mob from here to your objective. So we're going to remove flying and put in completely optional quests telling you to kill a certain number of each of the mobs you would normally fly over, that are still optional. But don't worry about why you're killing them or collecting more fecal matter from the wildlife, or why you need a dozen random fangs. It's not important. I just want you to do it for an extra opportunity to gain some experience. <br />
<br />
Wasn't one of their complaints about Mists that quests were way too linear? As they were in Cata as well? So they're going to make one major quest line as the only one that has anykind of text and then just throw in random grind quests and side quests here and there with no text? I mean that's the only thing they could be without quest text, right? Grind quests? Unless all the quest info is spoken in-game dialogue by the npc.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Translation:<br />
Fixing what we devastated in Cata would take actual programming and design skills, not to mention time we could use writing even more spiteful Aprils Fools &quot;notes&quot;.<br />
You're getting garrison NPCs able to dance with you instead and of course, you can always pay us extra money for never getting actual fixes to what we've broken. You will keep paying us anyway, so suck it up.<br />
<br />
Yes, Blizzard! Please take my money! I was about to dump it down a random drain, but I can spend it on you instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
LOL. I'm so stoked about being able to dance with the NPCs in my garrison. Maybe for like, holiday events and stuff... like the Christmas event and Valentine's event, I can get some special npc's that will come to my garrison that I can /emote and they will respond back to me. It would be amazing. And completely revolutionary. And if when I'm walking and they move out of my way, they WAVE at me. How cool would that be?<br />
<br />
It will make garrisons feel really lively while I'm instanced by myself in the middle of a pre-planned grindfest of a feature city collecting my Garrison/Farmville/SimCity resources and sending my garrison npcs on little side missions I control from a menu and will never actually see.<br />

So the Alliance players will start the game fighting alongside Thrall and Durotan to get garrison plots? Seems odd that Durotan would be handing out garrison plots in the part of Draenor under Draenei control. I guess there will be some book published to explain this to us?</div></div><hr />

I CARE about lore. Without lore, funny characters, cute little stories developed in side quests, the game is just a boring collecting 15 cow pies and I see no point in collecting 15 cow pies.<br />
<br />
The point is the game was more than simply collecting 15 cow pies : musics, stories, warcraft lore, humor, epicness, exploration, landscape, pvp, raids, meetings people and so on<br />

but more and more (since cataclysm but I'm totally panicked by what I read for WoD) they remove all flavor of the game, trying to make it a Diablo 4.<br />

Elitism isn't PV silver. <br />
<br />
PV silver is about as basic competence as you can get. Are you not able to complete it? Sorry to break it to you, but if you can't beat silver, you're bad.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drithien</div><div class="date">2014-04-16, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Questing: -The Jade Forest quests had a very clear story, but it also had a lot of side quests that could bog you down.<br />
-In Warlords of Draenor, your map will show you where to go to continue the main storyline, along with the locations of bonus objectives.<br />
-The bonus objectives no longer have any story text that go with them, just a list of objectives. Now when there is quest text, you will know that it is really worth reading.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, now questing is considered a detrimental experience... in a role-playing game. This feels like an episode of Punk'd in written form.<br />
<br />
So: -Instead of providing more quests, with more depth, additional complexity, offering increased challenge; instead for once developing questing as an equal at least to instanced raiding, they are going to reduce it.<br />
-Since big points on the map, automatic quest acceptance, and all other measures of the game playing itself for you (because clearly the average player nowadays lacks the intellect to use even a door-handle on his/her own), failed so miserably and are the primary reason for the game's decline; not the lack of content of any kind, much less open-world, role-playing content; now there will be ever-present directions. If that fails as well, in the next expansion there will be some kind of series of lighthouses spread all along the road you are supposed to take; because clearly the problem is with the lack of players' intellect, not the quality of the game and its direction away from what makes an open-world role-playing game such a game.<br />
-Less work for the developers, in a field where there is not much value anyway. All these years they failed to create a compelling questing experience, so they may as well give up most pretences and just have players whacking mobs. Less work, less costs to cover, the same boring tasks with the same non-immersive experience; everyone wins.<br />
<br />
I really don't understand how hard can it be for a, supposedly, role-playing game, with WoW's resources to do even the most basic thing about role-playing games right: offer a decent questing experience.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, actual problems with the design of the questing experience, such as the fact there is only one campaign for each faction, the linearity of it, the lack of personal decision, interactivity, choices; lack of race/class/specialization/profession-tailored questing; is largely ignored.<br />
<br />
And in the meantime despite years of the game's community showing its indifference towards it, once more, there is a massive push to shoehorn everyone into raiding. Because grinding the same bosses week after week for gear is such an exhilarating experience and what open-world role-playing games are about. And then the developers will wonder why subscriptions decline; and Bashiok will make a post about his wondering why players don't engage in raiding content since it is there in abundance, not once going through his head that the answer is simply: because most players don't like raiding.<br />
<br />
This philosophy that a feature is faulty, not the developers' work on it, seems to be getting out of hand in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The post we seem to be commenting on does not specify Silver as the level of PG achievement that will unlock HC5s. It can just as well be Endless 10, 30 or Bronze. Considering the overall levels of snowflake pandering in Bliz announcements so far, I expect it somewhere around Gold.<br />
Trying to cast people who don't want to bother with some contrived &quot;trials&quot; as &quot;bads&quot; is, indeed, elitism. Current dynamics of WoW already eliminate some of the most skillful players who simply no longer have time for all the extra shit required to stay relevant Where The Fun Is (my old friend was offsetting the grind he had no time for with his seriously mad skllz until well into Pandaland, then quit due to overflow of time-consuming compulsory crap; he was on cutting edge of HC raiding back in WotLK and Cata, but your ignorance would cast him as a bad anyway). Wish I could link his armory, but he's off for too long.<br />
Any attempts at justifying 7M subs forcibly sponsoring a minority (we'll see just how big, but I won't be surprised if it never gets above 1M) for which a lot of extra content is developed, is not even just elitism, it's Entitlement Princess pure and proud.<br />
What does one have to do with another?<br />
Well, if it's just Silver after adjustments to give all specs level playing field - we're all OK. Nothing special about beating it. Too bad expecting anything like this from Blizzard is a surefire recipe for sad disappointment. It will most likely be closer to Gold and in the very least as broken as current PGs. It's Blizzard we're talking about here. Which is to say, a whole &quot;tier&quot; of content, advertised as very well made and challenging (read: it consumed a considerable chunk of development time) will only be available to people with spare time to roll a PG-friendly spec and gather PG-friendly gear. Read: minority. I will not elaborate on moral implications of holding a position all WoW users should pay the same sub money while it's being spent on stuff most of them will never access.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's the thing. You know what you are doing. The entire point in requiring people to get PV silver is to prove they know what they are doing. Of course you find it redundant: you already know what you need to do.<br />
I'm QA, I don't mind redundancy at all. I'd LOVE some actual redundancy in this context, as in: PG minigames actually resembling group content. In my case it's not all that terribly relevant, since with Silver Tank and Gold Damage I'm already past the gate, but all borderline cases when people are very useful in actual groups while struggling with PG will be screwed. YES, I've read it the first time, Bliz said they will change PGs. So what? I'm just a WotLK kid, but I did have the time to see just how much to expect from such statements.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What? Why is that a problem? It would, like... re-sacred them. Doing lower level dungeons scaled at max level would be a dream come true.<br />
VP go away, so no more valour speedruns. This actually makes sense, as long as it doesn't replace speed levelling of alts by heirlooms with paid boosts entirely.<br />
<br />
<br />
That, and about your GF: Healing specs dont start to suffer in PV till gold rank.<br />
No. She was struggling with last stages of Silver Healing PG on her holy priest while already dominating LFRuns with people 10-20ilvls above her. Then she used her newly dinged resto shammy in timeless &quot;gear&quot; and breezed through both Silver and Gold. Same player, maybe slightly improved skill, an order of magnitude improvement in PG results.<br />
<br />
<br />
Base competency is all silver requires.<br />
No. It reqiures either high competency or a spec compatible with its gimmicky design. I can agree about damage, neither my hunter nor DK had any problem with it. Can't say about tanking besides doing Silver on first try with my DK, which doesn't actually mean anything to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can't clear silver PV, then you have no business being in LFR, since you won't do anything but drag everyone down with your blatant incompetence.<br />
Pure unadulterated bullshit. Once again, mah gurl was already a dominating carrier in LFR while still struggling with PG Silver. Same toon and same player, just a completely different game.<br />
Of course, once you accepted the &quot;PG = Competence&quot; dogma, I can't really expect you to believe any of that.<br />
<br />
If PG made any actual sense in any context, I would actually shout out loud to make it also a gate for LFR so that I wouldn't see so many people queuing as dps, coming on a blood DK in Timeless gear and doing 22k.<br />
But they don't and there's much more than not knowing your class that contributes to LFR wipes.<br />
What will it actually be in WoD, time will tell, but considering the consistent string of failures in design, balance and so on in recent years I don't expect it to be any better in any aspect, particularly as a check to see whether you have what it takes to complete tough group content.</div></div><hr />

Too bad expecting anything like this from Blizzard is a surefire recipe for sad disappointment. It will most likely be closer to Gold and in the very least as broken as current PGs. It's Blizzard we're talking about here. Which is to say, a whole &quot;tier&quot; of content, advertised as very well made and challenging (read: it consumed a considerable chunk of development time) will only be available to people with spare time to roll a PG-friendly spec and gather PG-friendly gear. Read: minority. I will not elaborate on moral implications of holding a position all WoW users should pay the same sub money while it's being spent on stuff most of them will never access.<br />
<br />
I'm QA, I don't mind redundancy at all. I'd LOVE some actual redundancy in this context, as in: PG minigames actually resembling group content. In my case it's not all that terribly relevant, since with Silver Tank and Gold Damage I'm already past the gate, but all borderline cases when people are very useful in actual groups while struggling with PG will be screwed. YES, I've read it the first time, Bliz said they will change PGs. So what? I'm just a WotLK kid, but I did have the time to see just how much to expect from such statements.<br />
<br />

VP go away, so no more valour speedruns. This actually makes sense, as long as it doesn't replace speed levelling of alts by heirlooms with paid boosts entirely.<br />

No. She was struggling with last stages of Silver Healing PG on her holy priest while already dominating LFRuns with people 10-20ilvls above her. Then she used her newly dinged resto shammy in timeless &quot;gear&quot; and breezed through both Silver and Gold. Same player, maybe slightly improved skill, an order of magnitude improvement in PG results.<br />
<br />
<br />
No. It reqiures either high competency or a spec compatible with its gimmicky design. I can agree about damage, neither my hunter nor DK had any problem with it. Can't say about tanking besides doing Silver on first try with my DK, which doesn't actually mean anything to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pure unadulterated bullshit. Once again, mah gurl was already a dominating carrier in LFR while still struggling with PG Silver. Same toon and same player, just a completely different game.<br />
Of course, once you accepted the &quot;PG = Competence&quot; dogma, I can't really expect you to believe any of that.<br />
<br />
If PG made any actual sense in any context, I would actually shout out loud to make it also a gate for LFR so that I wouldn't see so many people queuing as dps, coming on a blood DK in Timeless gear and doing 22k.<br />
But they don't and there's much more than not knowing your class that contributes to LFR wipes.<br />
What will it actually be in WoD, time will tell, but considering the consistent string of failures in design, balance and so on in recent years I don't expect it to be any better in any aspect, particularly as a check to see whether you have what it takes to complete tough group content.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was assuming silver because numerous blue posts prior to that one had noted that they were considering challenge mode silver for queing in certain modes. <br />
<br />
That said, you are very obviouslly mad. And I stand by what I said: If you cannot pass PV silver. You are bad. You may not think you are. But you are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats my point. Some people DONT learn these things. This isn't a difficult concept. If you know them, you spend all of ten minutes in the PV to show you know your class. If you don't know how to play your class, you won't pass the PV. When I did proving grounds, I marched in as a fury spec and had finished silver with zero difficulty because I actually knew how to play my class. On the other hand, people in my guild were struggling with it, and sure enough, they were the sorts who push half as much DPS as they should be in their gear.<br />
<br />
then the arguement is surely to fix the F-ing game's 100 levels to teach this stuff, rather than dumb it down then bandaid in a PV requirement for endgame? Surely? or does the Bliz &quot;solution&quot; seam fucking arsebackwards to anyone else<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BahamutOmega</div><div class="date">2014-04-18, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kinda like having the PG's silver achievement giving players the ability to bypass the base ilvl requirement deal (if that's still on the table, I know the devs were tossing that about back in early discussions). Would hope it would be account wide for each class type you get the 'cheev' with. We'll see how it goes. Overall, I still think WoD will go the route of Cata, but people will still play it (like me) regardless. I'm very unenthusiastic about just about everything in the new xpac. The only thing I'm really excited about is the more direct flightmaster paths... which is kinda sad. But hey, we're getting Garrisons to fill all our time killing and multi profession needs... that's got to account for something, right? Also, still no shaman tanking so I guess I better get to trying the &quot;You're Doing It Wrong&quot; PG tank 'cheev' on my shaman before we can't any more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bad &amp; mad. Hell yeah. I actually have a tshirt saying just that.<br />
Something tells me you were trying to imply I'm also wrong.<br />
Oh well, here. Have a lollipop.</div></div><hr />
