MMO-Champion acquired by Curse<br />
There we go. <br />
<br />
Press Release<br />
San Francisco, CA &#8211; July 19, 2010 &#8211; Curse, Inc. announced today the purchase of the #1 World of Warcraft news site, MMO-Champion.com. The site was bought from Major League Gaming for an undisclosed amount.<br />
<br />
MMO-Champion is a natural fit for Curse which already possesses the largest repository of add-ons available for MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) games such as World of Warcraft, Warhammer Online and Runes of Magic as well as extremely popular forums for Runescape, Aion and Final Fantasy XIV. The World of Warcraft news site attracts 7 million unique visitors and more than 80 million page views per month (Google Analytics WW, June 2010). The combination makes Curse the #1 MMO destination online.<br />
<br />
&#8220;The acquisition of MMO-Champion markedly sets Curse apart from the competition,&#8221; said Hubert Thieblot, CEO and Founder. &#8220;Not only does the addition solidify Curse as the largest MMO destination on the web, but it plays a central role in delivering a complete Curse MMO solution. Curse is now the ultimate resource for MMO news, forums, databases, and add-ons.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Gamers and advertisers alike will benefit greatly from MMO-Champion&#8217;s purchase by Curse. In the next few months, visitors can expect an updated page design and improved user experience. To insure the site&#8217;s strong content offering will not be compromised, Fabien Bonte, the site&#8217;s founder and administrator, will be joining the Curse staff as a full-time employee. Advertisers can take advantage of Curse&#8217;s extended reach into the core MMO market, making MMO gamers easier to connect with than ever. For more information about Curse and MMO-Champion, please visit www.curse.com.<br />
<br />
<br />
Boubouille's word (That's me!) <br />
NEW OWNERS! WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!<br />
<br />
No, seriously. This change will hardly affect the users, we will see a lot of improvements on the site over the next few months (not immediately, we still have to move to new servers) and a lot of people will be working hard to make MMO-Champion a wonderful place filled with love and gnomes. Our first goal is obviously to stabilize the current site and fix all the minor bugs you've been experiencing since the migration, then we'll work on the big stuff and eventually come up with a shiny new design and more features.<br />
<br />
I would also like to thank Major League Gaming for the 3 years I spent with them. They're the one who gave me a chance to bring MMO-Champion to a much higher level and even if it isn't obvious to everyone, the site probably wouldn't exist today without them. MLG's management and tech teams went through a lot of efforts to keep the site alive during its ridiculously fast growth, we're here today because of them. Curse and Major League Gaming will definitely keep working together in the future and great things will come out of this partnership.<br />
<br />
MMO-Champion has been around for 3 years, 4 months, and 19 days. Let's see how much further we can go.<br />
<br />
<br />
Update - Let's try to address some of the concerns. <br />
<br />
1. Redesign<br />
Redesign means &quot;make the site pretty&quot;, not completely change the layout of the page. If you want more details: <br />
The site won't change to a fixed width because it sucks to read wall of texts (=80% of my news posts)<br />
You will never get &quot;AWESOME NEW STUFF RELEASED! Click the link below to actually see the news&quot;, everything will stay on the front page, simple and clean.<br />
I want the blue tracker latest posts on the front page.<br />
We might add a couple of extra features like a separate box to track new posts in Off-Topic forums, etc ... <br />
We have to hunt down all the terrible bugs we have on the design. I mean, did you try to open the current site with IE7? Or did you try to edit your forum preferences (http://www.mmo-champion.com/profile.php?do=editoptions) without killing yourself because of how bad it looks? That's what I meant by &quot;the current design sucks&quot;<br />
Visually, we can probably do much better than that without changing the structure of the site too much. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Premium<br />
I'm not going to bullshit you, premium might happen but it's really not a top priority for the moment. I would hardly call it premium, more like &quot;Donator/Sponsor&quot; for people who would like to help, I would also like to explore new features through that like user generated blogs or user groups on forums, etc ... But really, I don't see it happening in 2010. <br />
<br />
If I ever add a Premium feature to the site, it will be because it can bring something more without penalizing people who don't want to pay, it won't be just because I'm jealous of Ghostcrawler and want to buy a bigger yacht than his. If something is free today, it will stay free. It's that simple.<br />
<br />
Doesn't sound attractive or well-thought? Good, that's because we have no immediate plan to do that. Exactly my point.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Control over the site<br />
I still take 99% of the decisions on the site, MMO-Champion is the biggest WoW news site out there and it means that the people I now work with know I'm not stupid when it comes to WoW websites. You don't just buy a site that works just fine with a plan to change everything, it's not worth the hassle, the only major change we could do to boost the traffic is to offer Night Elf porn to the users, and I was told I can't do that. <br />
<br />
<br />
4. Current plans with the site<br />
A lot of people are scared of the future, I'll try to layout the current plan for the next months. <br />
Reactivate the search function. <br />
Stabilize the site and make sure we stay online on patch days.<br />
Clean up the forums, add a moderator application form to the site, recruit more moderators and open a couple of extra forums.<br />
Redesign slightly and improve the Blue Tracker. (Search Function, etc ...)<br />
Redesign the site to make it good looking, see 1. Redesign<br />
Stronger support on all the tools I use to work on news each day, you have no idea how fucked up some of them are. I can't really post all the super secret stuff here but I can assure you that the sale will be a huge relief for me on that point.<br />
Possibly go full-scale with db.mmo-champion.com because I'm pretty sure you're all bored of the item pages with just a tooltip and no drop location or screenshot. (But we still have to decide that)<br />
<br />
<br />
If everything goes well, I will end up having a lot more time to work on news posts and the site will only get better, I think some people just underestimate the technical shitstorm behind each Beta patch or every single news. Having the backup of a WoW-focused company with tons of WoW-focused developers is a pretty huge thing for me.<br />
<br />
If you remember the last beta patch, there wasn't anything on the front page for 10 hours. That's the time I currently spend on tech stuff that I could spend on pretty screenshots of mechanic bunnies.</div></div><hr />

Then pretty much just ignored wowmatrix when they tried to contact curse about it, saying they would be nonprofit?<br />
<br />
And then curse made a curse client? That horribly slow thing?<br />
<br />
The Curse that offers paid premium services?<br />
<br />
You have sold your soul, Boubouille. YOUR SOUL.<br />
If I see any &quot;premium&quot; shit up here I'm going to be damn pissed, as will many others, though I'm fairly confident you won't let that happen :p</div></div><hr />

Kinda funny two of the major sources of wow news is both owned by curse. Lets hope that mmo-champion isn't pimped out like they have done to worldofraids with the blue comments and all the other extra stuff they have. The only feature I'd like to see added is a main page blue tracker widget like world of raids has so I can just see the recent stuff from the main page. That really is the only reason why I tend to visit world of raids cause I can get news + blue posts with out having to open another page right away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Grats... I guess...<br />
<br />
Accusation != proof.<br />
<br />
Curse has never sold gold. Curse has never &quot;stolen accounts&quot; with &quot;malicious software&quot;.<br />
<br />
Fake Curse clients have circulated around, but they're fakes used by hackers to phish. <br />
<br />
Ads on Curse have sometimes maliciously taken advantage of Flash vulnerabilities, but that isn't Curse's fault and nor is it something that is a unique problem for Curse, it can happen on any site.<br />

Check your facts please!</div></div><hr />

I don't care what kind of financial situation you were in, but submitting yourself to the Curse Empire is not the way to go.<br />
If your visitors wanted to be apart of a Curse community, they would be visiting World of Raids.<br />

This will not end well for you Boubouille, this will undoubtedly change MMO-Champion for the worse.</div></div><hr />

He didn't own the site; MLG did. Therefore it is them you should be hating for dishing the site out to Curse. I am sure he has to keep a roof over his own head and I am sure he loves doing this job otherwise he wouldn't put such 1st grade effort into it like he does, therefore I am pretty sure he doesn't have much choice in terms of sticking with the website, which is now owned by Curse; again, MLG's sale, not his.</div></div><hr />

No matter. Congrats to Boub for the new job. At the least, now you get paid for doing this stuff for us.<br />

I don't want Curse to infiltrate mmo-champ too much, or this will be a Real ID rebellion all over.<br />

As long as i dont have to sift through spamming of addons or links everywhere to curse.com, and of course any kind of paid service Im fine with this. Grats to boub capitalisim is still alive :D<br />

That makes no sense. If you are leaving mmo-champion because they are now owned by curse, why would you change to another curse owned site? You would be better of going to a site like wowraid.com even if it isn't as on the pulse of info as mmo-champion or world of raids since wowraid.com isn't owned by curse as of yet.</div></div><hr />

I don't care what kind of financial situation you were in, but submitting yourself to the Curse Empire is not the way to go.<br />
If your visitors wanted to be apart of a Curse community, they would be visiting World of Raids.<br />
<br />
This will not end well for you Boubouille, this will undoubtedly change MMO-Champion for the worse.<br />
<br />
Way to be unsupportive. Boubouille has been loyal to his readers through a lot of ups and downs, so I really doubt he'd go with this change if he wasn't sure that this was a positive thing. I for one hope he (or MLG or both) got a lot of money for this sale.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Curse has never sold gold. Curse has never &quot;stolen accounts&quot; with &quot;malicious software&quot;.<br />
<br />
Fake Curse clients have circulated around, but they're fakes used by hackers to phish. <br />
<br />
Ads on Curse have sometimes maliciously taken advantage of Flash vulnerabilities, but that isn't Curse's fault and nor is it something that is a unique problem for Curse, it can happen on any site.<br />

Come on people the website was not even owned by Boubouille it was owned by MLG prior to this. It was then bought out by Curse. Things like this happen in businesses. Nothing to go crazy about.

<br />
Frankly, I didn't know MLG &quot;owned&quot; the site. All I saw from them around here was one or few adds and that's it, I just figured they're frequent add-customers and since I, like on 99.99% sites completely and utterly ignore adds, it never crossed my mind to do anything for MLG/buy anything from them/etc.<br />

Oh well. Bottom line is, hope it doesn't change anything significant for the users. A forum for the add on requests/creators could be the only cool thing I can think of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;No, seriously. This change will hardly affect the users, we will see a lot of improvements on the site over the next few months (not immediately, we still have to move to new servers) and a lot of people will be working hard to make MMO-Champion a wonderful place filled with love and gnomes&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah...heard that before Curse got it's cash infusion/overlords, then they turned the site into something so full of 'features' that it turned into unusual crap and I gave up hosting my mods there. I dread going back the few times I have to every year. And at least it's still there; I still mourn the community-death that happened at wowace.<br />

the forums were already garbage, the only thing worth it was the front page news, i say we get boubille out of here, we all donate 2$ each to his paypal and he starts his own website from scratch, i'm pretty sure most of these 7 million users would migrate over</div></div><hr />

curse is poorly designed, navigation is a pain, crappy asp pages, dozens of links to everything. nobody with a brain, and really inside addons stuff, uses the curse website. the mac client is still useless.<br />
<br />
my hopes were something like some good people like kealten from curse moving here and boost mmochampion, not vice-versa. my hopes were about create something with wowinterface guys, a wow website with a community. my hopes were really different, including the minion updater from wowinterface. no way, go curse. i really cant understand why everything moves to them. <br />
<br />
now i just hope they will not move your stuff to the trash can. this website is nice because it's fast, and the whole forum-like browsing keeps users in a community mood, even if 3/4 comments are nonsense.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noomz</div><div class="date">2010-07-20, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2. Premium<br />
I'm not going to bullshit you, premium might happen but it's really not a top priority for the moment.<br />
<br />
If I ever add a Premium feature to the site, it will be because it can bring something more without penalizing people who don't want to pay<br />
<br />
You sound like Blizzard. This is disheartening.<br />
<br />
I hope you realize that it's the every day Joe user that makes this place live, and that having to pay for a premium service when you haven't had to for the years this site has been around, would be preposterous.<br />
Why would anyone need to donate anything, by the way? I thought finance was the least of the troubles now.<br />
<br />
If Premium means &quot;something extra&quot; and not &quot;Pay for what was previously free&quot; then it can be considered acceptable. Like Blizzard with their little payed services, we don't really need them but they're nice to have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
though my bigest fear is the whole premium thing as stated by many others (and now confirmed by you bibi).. that this MIGHT happen and it's this little might.. do I brace myself for impact once I have to pay to post more than 10posts an hour ? do I have to pay to be able to post links/imges?<br />
<br />
or is it merely increase my sig size or some silly title, if the latter then sure I can live with it.. but oh the damn horrid things I can see comming from this sale...<br />
<br />
for now bibi I'm on your side, but that may very well change once the changes are implemented..<br />

This seems like a double edged sword if you ask me. Curse has been my only source for addons, but in the long haul, I've had to be extremely cautious in what I download. I find if no coincidence at all that literally a day after I updated addons from curse, I was hacked (authenticator was en route via USPS...)

It will mean something extra, usually something that we can't just support on a large scale. I just don't like not having a feature around just because we can't do it for 1M people each day. <br />

Once again, I'd like to remember people that I'm not completely stupid and that I have no plan to jeopardize all the work I've put in MMO-Champion for the past 3 years. I'm not really known for bullshiting people (well, not in public.). If I say it's a good change, it is.<br />

<br />
You can't get hacked with addons fyi ;p but Curse is definitely the target of a lot of malicious attacks, a lot of people who think that Curse is unsafe are actually people who got scammed by fake Curse sites on Google. The only thing they can do is report and wait until Google reacts. <br />
<br />
Curse definitely had a couple of security issues in the past, but, well, so did MMO-Champion. (It wasn't too bad, but it happened, and I'm pretty sure it happened on every single WoW site out there)<br />
<br />
<br />
WELL! My account got hacked a few months ago and blizzard told be to not trust CURSE.COM.... Hmmmm.... FUCK! I use to love mmo-champ!<br />
<br />
Curse.com is an official fansite, I sincerely doubt a Blizzard employee told you to not use a site linked on the official site (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/community/fansites.html).<br />

Not gonna happen - right now there's two major MMO networks, Curse (Curse, CurseForge, WowAce, wowdb, World of Raids, Arena Junkies, and now MMO-Champion) and ZAM (zam, Allakhazam, wowhead, Thottbot, TankSpot, wowinterface)<br />

It's really respectful and thoughtful of you to understand that and take the time to update this post with answers to try and quell any fears that the community might have about this change. <br />
<br />
This is a wonderful opportunity and it's great to know that MMO-Champ is getting this sort of acknowledgment. <br />
<br />
You've never steered us wrong before and you've always made efforts to give the community what they've wanted. I don't think anyone can deny that you've always been real with us. You're more of our friend, in that regard, than just the guy who runs MMO-Champ. And, that's probably why so many people are a bit scared of you disappearing or the loss that we'd all feel if this site was no longer still greatly in your hands. <br />
<br />
Again, congrats so much to MMO-Champion and to you! I'm definitely looking forward to everything that's to come, in the future, and to you having a bit more time to focus on showing us the beta goods! ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
To an extent. But a fixed width site doesn't work very well with the amount of content that goes into a news post on sites like this. You end up scrolling for a majority of the time you're on the site.</div></div><hr />

Companies don't work like that. Curse didn't save up $xxxxxxxxx without doing anything with it and woke up one day thinking &quot;hey, we should buy MMO Champion!&quot;. The acquisition is an investment that will hopefully be profitable over time. <br />
<br />

You know the reason everyone is so heated because this comes on the heels of the blizz real id thing. Calm down, relax and just see what happens. Stop thinkin the worse. Even if it is no one owes this site to you. If it goes under there will be another.<br />
<br />
It's a great thing to be concerned, not aggressive or hostile, but to be concerned and to show it. That is the best for the page.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Armond</div><div class="date">2010-07-20, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fixed page width is bad for a number of reasons, even ignoring the wall of text thing. The most prominent are sideways scrolling on smaller resolution monitors and wasted space on higher resolution monitors. I'm sure we've all experienced both at some point in our lives (such as RuneScape on 800x600 back in the day or GameFAQs on 1280x1024 more recently). Can we stop talking about it now?<br />
<br />
All the complaints and &quot;oh noes&quot; I've read here have basically boiled down to &quot;Curse is going to change things&quot;. But, as Boub said earlier, he's still in control of nearly everything. It doesn't look like premium membership for regular content is something he wants to do - I interpreted an earlier post of his as &quot;premium membership would be for content that would be awesome but would suck up bandwidth&quot;. With regards to malicious ads, it's already been said that there's no proof that Curse was at fault for that instead of the ad-makers. Occam's razor says that without proof of a Curse conspiracy, it's more likely that Curse was the target of various attacks because they're a big site.<br />
<br />
The Curse move does, however, provide increased benefits for the MMO-Champion employees. I'm not positive on this because I've never cared before, but I believe that consists of Boub and the moderators. Quite honestly, I don't envy their jobs, but they do them well (I think every problem but one I've ever had with a mod has been my fault anyway), so I think the increased pay is a great thing.<br />
<br />
The short version: If you use any sort of ad protection utility (noscript, adblockplus, etc), you should only notice an increase in the quality of the site.</div></div><hr />

Things are always promised during a merger or acquisition like this. Those things that are promised are not always held to, however.<br />
After that little RealID stunt Blizzard pulled last month, I don't have much trust for companies making decisions in the best interest of the customer anymore. Most of the world operates on a &quot;money is king&quot; mentality, it's sad to see the gaming industry* throwing themselves into that more and more. You can make a profit and guarantee success without selling out.<br />

Interesting... I've been considering getting this curse premium thing for a while now but there's still too little to justify spending that much money on it.

Could work out alright, could work out the way all the people shouting &quot;we're doomed&quot; seem to think.<br />
<br />
I have some faith in the WoW community at large though. If this turns into your average &quot;sold out disaster&quot; a new site will spring up somewhere somehow by someone, word of it will spread and the majority or MMOC users will eventually find their way there. <br />
<br />
Lets hope it dosen't come to that.<br />
For now i'm just hoping this turns out alright and we can all keep enjoying our daily updates courtesy of Boub till the end of time. Which at this point seems as likely as anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
anyways curse wont change too much because mmo community is fast and mostly doesnt like big changes, a new site would be established very soon ,and i think boub knows that very well. if mmochamp goes the wrong way i'm sure he will play his part to prevent something like that.<br />
<br />
keep up the good work boubouille</div></div><hr />

MMO-Champion is always the first site I check in the morning and the last I check at night, just to see if anything interesting is happening. If you'd ever like a copy editor, you know where to find me. For instance, in press releases, it's generally best to aim for the correct word--ensure, not insure. Unless you're paying money for an insurance policy against the eventuality of compromised content offerings, of course. And yes, I'm a professional copy editor. I realize that makes me hated by most of humanity, but there it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This made me lol. The (probably) million dollar website needs sponsors and donations? Yeah right. Nice try of making the corporate bullshit seem innocent there, Boub ;)<br />
Let's face it people, MMO-Champ won't be for the fans, it'll be for the wallets.<br />
<br />
And by the way, if the site was recently owned by MLG Gaming, I doubt Boub is getting a lot of cash in this transfer, just for the record. I see some people goes &quot;Gratz Boub, you deserve it!&quot;<br />
I'm no expert on the site's history, but based on what was said in the news post Boub already sold it ages ago to another site, when the market value was a lot lower... could be wrong though.</div></div><hr />

-facepalm-<br />
<br />
Some people are being a little melodramatic, I think.<br />
<br />
First off, it wasn't really his choice. MMO-Champion belonged to MLG, and thus it was their decision to sell the website to Curse--besides, the hell does it matter? I saw, keep coming to the site until it does die out, if it does at all. And I highly doubt that. Boub seems to know what he's doing.</div></div><hr />

Good riddance. Also, Boub didn't get any money from this ordeal, it was MLG who sold MMO-Champion, not Boub. The site was already sold once, to MLG.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to the changes, hoping they'll just focus on fixing the numerous errors on the current site. We've already got adds, and I don't think they'll add much more of them. <br />
<br />
Don't you just hate when people go over dramatic over things? And how some people just are against any changes, just because its cool and some others decided to do so.<br />
<br />
One mammot dies and will be replaced by another one? I really doubt it.<br />

As long as Boub stays around, it will be fine.</div></div><hr />

That reputation was created by idiots. If you lack the common sense of checking wether you're actually on the right site and dowloading the right stuff, its your fault. You cannot accuse Curse for people being stupid enough to click on wrong links @ google. And the adverts, well, its not Curse's fault there are some with spyware or anything, its the ad-providers fault.</div></div><hr />
