Dev Watercooler: Mists of Pandaria PvP<br />
Now that Mists of Pandaria has been out a few weeks, we wanted to let you all know what we consider working well in PvP, what we want to improve, and what’s coming down the pike. I’m going to split this up into three parts: a discussion of Matchmaking Rating (MMR), class balance concerns, and a sneak peek at some of our PvP plans.<br />
<br />
MMR<br />
As I’m sure you’re aware, the intent behind MMR is to match players by skill. This is accomplished by comparing an assigned number (MMR) that adjusts based on the relative MMR of the opponents you win or lose to. Matching players by their effectiveness or performance helps make sure that less experienced players aren’t always getting stomped by expert players, and that competitors at all levels are earning their victories by battling players of roughly equivalent ability. MMR isn’t intended to be a “PvP score”—its primary function is in matchmaking. We’ve seen a lot of players asking for an MMR reset, and to be fair, we had originally planned on doing one (and even announced it beforehand). Some of you may be concerned that high-ranking players won’t have a reason to play and will be able to just sit on their high ratings, perhaps even earning Gladiator without having to fight opponents. While we think there’s some legitimacy to the concern, we don’t think resetting MMR is the right way to address it.<br />
<br />
Because MMR is a measure of your performance as a player, we don’t think it makes a lot of sense to reset MMR at the end of a season or expansion. It’s unlikely your skill atrophied significantly more than that of your competition between seasons, so there isn’t a lot of benefit in measuring it again. If we did reset MMR then what you’d likely see is a handful of mismatched games, where experienced players rock weaker players until MMR is calibrated again. That’s a lot of pain for relatively little gain since the MMRs will likely settle back into the same places anyway. It is important to remember that the Conquest point cap, Elite rewards and Gladiator titles are all tied to Team Rating and not MMR. Your Team Rating increases and decreases as you win and lose, and your Team Rating is really the most important number when it comes to Arena PvP.<br />
<br />
However, we took a hard look at the way we measure Team Rating, and came to the conclusion that our formula doesn’t do a good enough job of measuring the potential for improvement over the course of a season. While your skill may not necessarily improve over the course of a season, your gear definitely does, and that should have an effect on the relative power of your team. We’re currently working on a change to allow Team Ratings to grow faster over time, as long as you keep playing. We don’t have any specifics to share yet, but this correction will have the added benefit that players who continue playing will be capable of reaching higher Team Ratings, and therefore potential access to rewards, than someone who stops playing and sits on their rating.<br />
<br />
As a potential example let’s say the Fatty Goat Steaks have a Team Rating of 2700 and the Mushan Tongues have a Team Rating of 2500. The Fatty Goat Steaks decide their Team Rating is high enough that they’re going to sit out the rest of the season. The Mushan Tongues keep playing each week, their gear gradually improves, and they continue to win many of their matches. Because of the new inflation component, their Team Rating rises, let’s say, 300 additional points to 2800. They are now higher ranked than the Fatty Goat Steaks. If the Fatty Goat Steaks decide to jump back into Arena matches, they can benefit from the inflation as well, but they’re going to have to play and win to catch up. It’s not going to be a system where you have to play every day just to defend your rating, but certainly one where you can’t sit at the top doing nothing and collect your rewards at the end. We’ll have more details on exactly how this system will work as we get closer to its implementation.<br />
<br />
We believe this adjustment to the Team Rating formula will have a similar benefit to the “rating decay” that some of you have been asking for, but will feel more positive – rather than feeling like you must keep running just to stay in place (i.e. keep your current score), players that continue participating will be rewarded with higher Team Ratings. As a season wears on, this should also make upper brackets more active as well.<br />
<br />
To support this change we’re going to expand the 5.1 feature of improving the item level of your raid armor and weapons using Valor to now include Justice, Honor, and Conquest points as well. A Gladiator who has purchased a full set of Conquest gear will now have a compelling motivation to keep playing in patch 5.1, since they’ll be able to improve that set by spending Conquest points.<br />
<br />
Class Balance Concerns<br />
We have 34 class specializations in the game now, and the intention here isn’t to go through every one to discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Instead, I’m going to address the ones that players seem to be most concerned about. That’s inherently a subjective call on my part, so I apologize if you think we missed something. Also, simply because something isn’t mentioned here doesn’t mean it’s being ignored. You can see some of the specific changes we are trying out in the 5.1 patch notes.<br />
<br />
Beastmastery Hunters – We agree that stacking too many cooldowns to blow someone up is not interesting, skillful, or fair. (I also want to be clear that with all of these issues, we’re not blaming players for using the tools that we gave them; we’re blaming ourselves.) We’re taking a hard look at the various Hunter cooldowns with the intention of reducing their burst. Hunters are receiving a buff in that they will no longer need to swap between Aspect of the Hawk and Aspect of the Fox. We also hope these changes help result in higher representation of Survival and Marksman Hunters.<br />
<br />
Update - We have just discovered a bug in which the debuff that makes Stampede pets weaker than normal pets was not being applied in Arenas. This helps explain why hunters could cause so much damage in Arenas but not in (say) the outdoor world or a dungeon environment.<br />
<br />
Warriors – We don’t think Warrior burst is out of control the way Hunter burst is. It’s possible that the combination of Warrior control and burst are too hard to counter, though. The changes we’re looking at are reducing both burst and control. The Glyph of Gag Order in particular is just too powerful for PvP. We think that if you manage to keep a Warrior from you, you should be allowed to get off a cast (and if you’re a Warrior who just can’t stand the thought of that, you can still spec into Storm Bolt.) Shockwave, Avatar, and Recklessness are also mentioned a lot, and we’re looking at them as well.<br />
<br />
Rogues – We think that Rogue damage in PvP is appropriate—the damage that some other classes are dealing is too high, and we want to adjust those cases before we do any tinkering elsewhere. We still like the Rogue suite of tools and abilities, but we feel like some of these mechanics might have been eclipsed by newer, shinier versions. We are looking at improving Rogue mobility and control in conservative ways.<br />
<br />
Mages – We are going to tone down Mage burst and control. We had hoped moving more of their control to talents would force some exclusivity in crowd control options, but it wasn’t sufficient. We increased the cost of Spellsteal significantly to promote its use strategically instead of stealing everything available. We’ve also been trying out changes to Deep Freeze, Frost Bomb, and Pyroblast to reduce burst and control.<br />
<br />
Monks – We know some players are concerned about Windwalker viability in Arenas. The Monk class has a high skill cap and they come with a learning curve. The Windwalker PvP bonuses are quite powerful and players aren’t really taking advantage of them yet. We absolutely want the newest class to be popular, but we’re also trying to be conservative and not recreate the situation where the Death Knight dominated PvP and PvE when it first launched. We do want to give the Monk a few more weeks and see where it stands, but we are keeping a close eye on how things develop.<br />
<br />
Healing – We agree that off-spec healers are too competitive with dedicated healers. Specs such as Shadow, Elemental, and Balance are supposed to be able to provide some healing—that’s one of their perks—but they shouldn’t be able to substitute for a dedicated healer. The change we are going to try here is to have PvP Power benefit either your damage or healing depending on spec. We are concerned that healing may be too high even for dedicated healers, especially for Restoration Shaman and Holy Paladins, who are incredibly strong in PvP at the moment. After we tone down some of the burst damage coming from Hunters, Warriors, and Mages, we may try the PvP healing debuff at 30% instead of the current 15%, but that won’t happen until after we’ve resolved the damage issues.<br />
<br />
Crowd Control – At the moment, we’re satisfied with the state of crowd control. We tried to not add new stackable forms of crowd control to any given spec, but because players have so many crowd control options (say, choosing a stun vs. a snare via talents) the overall number of crowd control spells that a PvP player needs to learn has grown. The pool just became deeper. We know that some of you have concerns, and we’ll keep an eye on it.<br />
<br />
Burst – Aside from Hunters, and possibly Warriors and Mages, we don’t think burst is out of control. Other specs that get mentioned by players are Destruction Warlocks, Frost Death Knights, and Shadow Priests. Those are definitely on our radar, but we don’t have any changes to announce at the moment.<br />
<br />
PvP Sneak Peek<br />
We have a lot of irons in the fire on the development team, and we’re usually reluctant to discuss ideas that aren’t fully implemented in the game yet. Despite all of our caveats, ideas that we delay or cancel tend to get turned into “broken promises.” With that in mind, please understand that you may not see some of these ideas in the next patch, or the patch after that, or any time soon. These are just ideas we’re bouncing around:<br />
<br />
Loss of Control UI – This is a feature we’ve wanted to build for a long time, and it’s finally close. If you’re feared, you probably realize you’re feared because your character runs around crazy with a big chattering skull over your head. However, if you’re stunned or silenced or disarmed, you don’t often realize it immediately and push your buttons which don’t do anything and as a result the game feels unresponsive. The loss of control UI makes sure you know when something prevents you from using your abilities. It has benefits for solo or instance play as well, but it’s largely a PvP-driven feature.<br />
<br />
Rated Battleground Participation Rewards – If you’ve PvPed for any length of time, you’ve been in one of those matches where the final score is so close that victory was a breath away. When we do our jobs right and give you one of those really close matches, it’s sad to not get any reward for participating, so we want to give out some kind of small reward. The rewards will be based on the final score to discourage exploitation.<br />
<br />
Battleground and Arena Maps in Dungeon Journal – While veteran PvP players already know all of the Arena and Battleground maps, we think Dungeon Journal is a good way to introduce the basic objectives and map overlay so newer competitors don’t have to learn to swim while drowning.<br />
<br />
Improved Scoreboard – It might seem silly to some, but we think small touches matter. Right now, the entire way we end a Battleground hasn’t changed much: it feels a little archaic and isn’t very exciting. We want to have an actual “You win!” toast, followed by a more exciting scoreboard.<br />
<br />
Smoother Battleground Brackets – We have technology now to scale down player items for Challenge Modes, and you might be aware that we scaled up player items during our beta raid testing. We’d like to use the same mechanic to scale up players within the lower level PvP brackets. For example, in the level 15 to 19 bracket, we could make all characters behave as if they were level 19 for purposes of the Battleground. If this idea works well, we could potentially condense lower level brackets and maybe reduce queue times.<br />
<br />
Matchmaking – Our Battleground matchmaking system hasn’t changed much since it debuted and doesn’t yet benefit from many of the advances we developed for Dungeon Finder and Raid Finder. The original Battleground queuing system was designed for speed because it only had a single realm of candidates. By incorporating more of the new tech we’ve since developed, we can help ensure that there are a certain number of healers per team or at least a good class distribution.<br />
<br />
Honor and Conquest Item Upgrades – We’ve talked about how we’re going to allow players to upgrade raid items with Valor. As mentioned above, we are going to let PvP players increase the item level of their Honor or Conquest gear by spending Honor or Conquest, respectively.<br />
<br />
Small Groups joining Rated Battlegrounds – We still don’t want to let solo players queue for Rated Battlegrounds because it would undermine the intent of coordinated group PvP, and then they really just become normal Battlegrounds that reward better gear. However, we’ve heard your concerns that getting even 10 players together to queue for a Rated Battleground can be challenging. Our idea is to let a group of 5 players queue together, which we would then match with another group of 5 players. We think this can still provide a relatively balanced and viable team. One of the crazier ideas on the table would be to convert some of our smaller Battlegrounds, such as Gilneas, to have a 5v5 option.<br />
<br />
Tol Barad and Wintergrasp – We are discussing making level 90 versions of these PvP zones that players could queue for to earn bonus honor.<br />
As I said, this is a brain dump of a lot of ideas that a lot of different developers are working on. This is not a list of patch notes and not all of these may come to pass. Please let us know what you think, if we’re on the right track, or if you think we missed a big PvP issue. PvP balance is always going to be really subjective, and while balance is desirable, continual buffs and nerfs that don’t actually solve problems have the potential to be worse than the imbalances they’re trying to fix.<br />

New rating change sounds absolutely terrible. <br />

Upgrading gear with conquest sounds stupid too. I'm already being punished enough for not doing snoozefest RBGs by getting my tier 2 a few weeks later and the rest of my gear a month later, now my iLvl will be lower than RBG heroes too. Fantastic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axi</div><div class="date">2012-10-31, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reasoning on the MMR not being reset is still ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Rank 1 Gladiators and 1300 rated casuals agree that unbiased competition is healthy for the popularity of rated pvp in this game. There is no problem with MMR sorting the wheat from the chaff over time, but the people who design the game implying that it is a foregone conclusion who will do well and designing the game around that is quite insulting to all of us.<br />
<br />
Other things I want to mention: <br />
<br />
1) rated 5v5 Battlegrounds would be epic and immense, great idea to avoid the drama from big guilds who you are sort of forced into joining if you want to RBG on my server.<br />
<br />
2) Like the change for offhealing, and I play Spriest main.<br />
<br />
3) Like the 30% healing debuff too, might even need to go further.Healers are OP even vs current levels of BM/Warrior burst, let alone what level they could be at after the burst nerfs and with gear constantly improving.<br />
<br />
4) The throw silence nerf is not good, its only lowering the skillcap of warrior. 95% of pvp warriors would sooner lose damage or burst or see nerfs to shockwave than the throw silence. It feels an epic ability to use, and intelligent use is a great filter for the best warriors to shine.<br />
<br />
5) Not bothered about making sure each team in a random BG has a set number of healers, the problem is more that some healers are generally too powerful, esp. Resto Shaman and Druid.<br />
<br />
6) Mage changes have been urged by so many for so long, and I'm glad to see they are finally getting some balancing adjustments, but I'm worried that they could go too far and be too slow to react should their arena viability decrease too much. Their class design is too much based on shatter and burst in general, until you fix that whole premise they are going to be very hard to balance.<br />
<br />
7) The 2s bracket with the offhealing changes could actually be sort of enjoyable if healers were banned from it. I know its kind of draconian but healers in 2s is absolutely stupid. MMR in 2s also needs to be looked at, it changes far more slowly than 3s or 5s, and results in people who have a 1500 MMR needing to go on absolutely crazy winstreaks to improve their rating by any margin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogues are mediocre. I still see them in BGs putting out some damage. A couple of simple buffs can fix their pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope they have two tiers, 1-60 (no resilience) and 61-89 (resilience on gear, ability to gem for resilience). A single 1-89 bracket would be too punishing for players with no resilience.</div></div><hr />

Oh right thats warriors, hunters and spriests. <br />
<br />
I'd be more worried that they considered resto shamans and holy paladins to be 'worse' than resto druids at the moment, rather than (the lack of mentioning) ret paladins dominating baddies at 1500.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They didn't mention us because we're not a problem. Off-Healing is our only real strength as a class; our mobility is pretty lousy as is our control. Retribution burst is also in a much better place than it was in Cataclysm, and chaining all of our cooldowns onto a single Macro isn't the best way to play Retribution; smart PvPers don't try to CC ret until AFTER the Guardian vanishes, after all.</div></div><hr />

Resto Shaman is definitely better in high level pvp than Resto druid, but its pretty close, and for 95% of people Resto Druid is a lot more difficult to play against in arenas.<br />
<br />
Agree though that Resto druid needs nerfs badly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No PvP power scaling from hybrids is quite a big change. I had hoped they would have toned it down by 50% or something. Many players are sitting at 40% pvp power. 40% less healing is a big game changer. Elemental shamans and moonkin druids went from being in a bad position to absolute garbage.<br />
<br />
I had hoped Blizzard would have realised that putting in a 30% less damage and 45% less healing debuff in PvP zones would have fixed some issues. At least made it more playable. Waiting with a healing reduction is beyond stupid. But as long as warrior and hunter burst is being reduced further Im somewhat satisfied.</div></div><hr />

It’s unlikely your skill atrophied significantly more than that of your competition between seasons, so there isn’t a lot of benefit in measuring it again.<br />
<br />
the problem i have with this statement is the fact that there is the possibility of some comps that will be viable and some that will not when they do buffs/nerfs. since they did not reset the mmr, comps from the previous season dont really have to play and can sit on their rating and get gladiator whereas if they were to start from scratch they may not have attained said rank.<br />
<br />
i understand the theory, because quite frankly the good players will naturally be back at the top within a few weeks, and there may be no instances in which i described that never (or have ever for that matter) happen but the possibility is there.<br />
<br />
to be a little more clear, i will just use this as a rough example, note i said rough example. lets say that during season X a warrior, spriest and resto druid are a crazy comp, able to obtain ratings that are good for glad and this is due to some imbalancing issues wth warrior and spriest synergy being to strong. after season X they decide not to reset the mmr and during season Y the same team keeps their ratings despite the fact that some nerfs came their way and because of this they most likely would not have obtained the same rating.<br />
<br />
this is my issue with the non reset of mmr, but then again i dont play the game anymore lol. but if i were this would be my issue because thats all i ever did was pvp</div></div><hr />

You cant hit a high team rating without a high MMR unless you never lose, ever. personal MMR and personal rating move with each other depending on your performance, with MMR being less reactive than personal rating.</div></div><hr />

You did, you missed the entire section devoted to mages (specifically, frost) and the fact that there are other casters in WoW outside of mages as well. Balancing two classes against each other and saying &quot;screw you&quot; to the rest isn't good balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've already made numerous nerfs to Hunters, rightfully so, but seem to still be working on day 1 MoP or live builds for balancing, not 5.1 like they should be. Stampede popped, AoE CC such as a root, fear bomb, or freeze. BW popped, CC the hunter and/or pet. So that leaves just Rapid Fire as our CD for the pvp power. Countering a 5.1, or hell a live, CD alignment isn't hard. Worst comes to worst, jump from high ground to low ground and ta-da, pets still have to run after you burning precious CD time.<br />
<br />
Hunter representation is high because of day 1 MoP. Saying that we're still OP, especially with 5.1 coming, is just plain silly.</div></div><hr />

Its no surprise that they dont care about shamans as usual and neither does anyone else unless your resto</div></div><hr />

MMR is just a skill rating that matches you to like-skilled players. TEAM RATING is what matters.<br />
<br />
i dont think you have a full understanding of how mmr works. im in not way a professional but i know that without resetting the mmr, the scenario i described can in fact happen.<br />
<br />
your mmr and team rating are somewhat independant of each other. therefore if you keep your mmr from the previous season you will gain team rating a much faster rate than anyone else. while i agree with the fact that good players will essentially get to the top within a few weeks not resetting the mmr allows these teams to reach previous team ratings obtained the previous season much quicker<br />
<br />
basically what it does is make the ladder screwy. for instance if a team that was previously not very viable suddenly becomes viable due to buffs/nerfs they now have to play, and win, a lot more games than the team with the higher mmr.<br />
<br />
for instance. my warrior/spriest/resto druid team that obtained the rating good enough for glad (who due to nerfs and buffs, would have a much more difficult time reaching the same rating) now only has to win 20 games to get back to their previous rating. whereas, lets for example say, a warlock, rogue, and holy paladin team that now has viable synergy, and would most likely beat the warrior,spriest, resto druid, now has to win 100 games in order to even get close to glad ratings.<br />
<br />
remember my examples are just that, examples.<br />
<br />
tl:dr not resetting the mmr makes it incredibly easier for teams that camped ratings last season for glad to do so again this season with minimal effot. theyre actively encouraging people to not play games throughout the season since within the first week 2800+ rated teams will be back at that rating and then not play anymore</div></div><hr />

If you take healing away from ele/enh is really all we got to stay alive with and that isnt really that much! i think were the only class that dont have a respectful self def Cd. Such as a war Die by the sword or a hunters retrance. As far as enh goes i hate that my dmg is tied to searning totem. It dies 24 7 in pve and pvpe and i have to throw it down ever time a healer is running away when i catch up with them, or it just dieing from some small dmg. And my last complaint for shamans is Capacitor Totem. Yes if glyhp it does reduce the amount of time for it to go off but i cant lose my other Glyhps. wars have 20 sec frontal stun for 3 secsl. why cant shaman i haven a instant stun that on a 45 sec cd?? I just want enh to not to worry about searning totem as much and have a decent self def cd and Capacitor totem to be instant a maybe a lil bump on dmg. I dont want us to be op, but i dont want to walk in to arena with rockbiter &quot;useing UF for the 40% dmg reduce&quot; on my weapon and poping every self def cd i got &quot;shaman rage and Stone Bulwark totem., and note im full pvp gear with almost 60% res&quot; just to get shit on so easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1)if you want to have a leg up on other players play all the classes we discussed as being OP or on the radar of being OP. Trust me, we will talk about nerfing said classes but we might make another problem, so don't worry as far as this expansion is concerned these OP classes will remain OP until the next expansion to be sure.<br />
2)we listened to everyone calling to make healing less OP in pvp for the last 3years and our healing is so OP now, that our off-healers are healing for extreme amounts. We really do listen to you guys! We really do!<br />
3)for those times when we get pvp right and the matches are super close, enjoyable and make you want to pvp more, we will give a small prize to the losing side. These close matches are so fucking rare that its like winning the lottery, so we will treat it as such.<br />

In conclusion, we suck at pvp, all the promises about balance etc. that we have made for the last 3 expansions, we admit are all bull shit. Just keep paying us money for being failures lol.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanegasi</div><div class="date">2012-10-31, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dont think you have a full understanding of how mmr works. im in not way a professional but i know that without resetting the mmr, the scenario i described can in fact happen.<br />
<br />
your mmr and team rating are somewhat independant of each other. therefore if you keep your mmr from the previous season you will gain team rating a much faster rate than anyone else. while i agree with the fact that good players will essentially get to the top within a few weeks not resetting the mmr allows these teams to reach previous team ratings obtained the previous season much quicker<br />
<br />
basically what it does is make the ladder screwy. for instance if a team that was previously not very viable suddenly becomes viable due to buffs/nerfs they now have to play, and win, a lot more games than the team with the higher mmr.<br />
<br />
for instance. my warrior/spriest/resto druid team that obtained the rating good enough for glad (who due to nerfs and buffs, would have a much more difficult time reaching the same rating) now only has to win 20 games to get back to their previous rating. whereas, lets for example say, a warlock, rogue, and holy paladin team that now has viable synergy, and would most likely beat the warrior,spriest, resto druid, now has to win 100 games in order to even get close to glad ratings.<br />
<br />
remember my examples are just that, examples.<br />
<br />
tl:dr not resetting the mmr makes it incredibly easier for teams that camped ratings last season for glad to do so again this season with minimal effot. theyre actively encouraging people to not play games throughout the season since within the first week 2800+ rated teams will be back at that rating and then not play anymore<br />
<br />
My understanding of MMR is from what Ghostcrawler JUST posted, which was clear as day. MMR has no bearing on Team Rating and it does nothing to how fast you can raise your Team Rating. MMR is nothing but a &quot;you are at this skill, so let's queue you against this other team with a similar skill&quot; number. It amazes me that you continue to ignore what Ghostcrawler said. You even said they're independent of each other. Please explain how that makes Team Rating raise &quot;faster&quot;.<br />
<br />
In fact, if we want to take this speculation further, higher MMR may actually hurt your Team Rating gain when compared to a new group. A new group with similar skill can blast through the lower MMR &quot;ladder&quot; because they are easy, playing more games, while the higher MMR old team has to actually fight each match, playing less games. If this was in the new &quot;reward play time&quot; system, the new team/lower MMR team has the clear advantage.<br />
<br />
Again, that is merely speculation into how MMR and Team Rating could possibly be related based upon how teams operate, but the plain and simple fact is that MMR HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH END OF SEASON RESULTS. It is entirely possible for a team with a low MMR to have a higher Team Rating than a team with a higher MMR, given the new system works and assuming the higher team &quot;sits&quot; on their rating. To explain the new system better than Ghostcrawler, think of Juggernaut from Marvel's X-Men. The longer he moves, the more momentum he gains, and the stronger he gets. The new system is Juggernaut-based. If you play more games, you gain more Team Rating per win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Read the goddamn blues. For the final time, Mages are not the only casters in the game, or are you too thick skulled to grasp this? Maybe Blizzard won't succeed in re-designing mages to avoid their burst issues. However, it doesn't justify the continuation of the poor balancing tactic of keeping up a mage/warrior arms race while forcing other classes to end up in their path of destruction. You can continue to engage in tribal little tirades and rants and how you're &quot;entitled&quot; to hit them for half their HP blah blah blah, but in the end, it's just whining and not going to fix anything.</div></div><hr />

Or, translated from Devspeak: <br />

WTB a smokescreen, incapacitating abilities, an instant disorient, teleporting, speed boosts, a disarm, a better 6 second stun, and not needing to place a stupid totem that can be melee'd/LoSed, cutting the damage output for my enhancement sham.<br />
<br />
You can have Hex/On demand selfhealing back, if that's all it takes to get that many tools.<br />

Rogues did crap damage in Wrath. Did get pretty high late Cata.<br />
<br />
They've definitely had a solid PVP toolset for a long time. Shamans for example, have a really terrible PVP toolset (although I haven't played mine much since MoP launched). I think their objective should be to improve some other classes' PVP utility/survivability/etc rather than pigeonholing classes into &quot;your class works well but to offset that your damage sucks&quot; and &quot;your class sucks, here's some huge damage to make up for it&quot;. Just my opinion.<br />

That's not true, rogues did very well in wrath, they just had low survivability tbh. I agree on the utility, but I don't mind damage being a little uneven. Take the rogue/mage combo for example, it has reigned supreme for years, and it's still in a good place, rogues being the class to catch and lock down people, mage being the class to absolutely destroy it if the opposing team is caught off guard. Let the rogues keep their awesome arsenal, but keep their damage mediocre.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad they admit how powerful resto shamans and holy paladins are right now in PvP, as that was my main concern. Resto Shaman especially are like tanks and once again mana is never an issue for them. Though all the community seems to care about is high-lighting Warrior and BM burst. Healing has always been a serious issue in PvP and in later tiers of PvP gear, its only going to get worse. Get that 30% reduction in for starters, but it's a band aid fix at best. If it doesn't make it in with the patch, i'm going to be depressed.<br />
<br />
Would also like them to fix the amount of healers per a team in Random Bgs. Some of us still enjoy jumping in a random game from time to time. With the state of current healers, seeing the oppsing team with 4-5 healers and your own team with just 1 or none, it's safe to say that game is an automatical loss from the begining. Arena and Rated bgs are typically balanced on role numbers, so it's not an issue there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kinda surprised they didn't mention ret on either being too bursty or having too good off-healing....<br />
<br />
Because you seriously can't even compare a Ret Paladins off healing to a Shadow Priests. It's not even comparable. A ret paladin typically heals for far less than a shadow priest will. The burst is also typically, all CDs. Which is comparable to any class that pops all their cds.</div></div><hr />

This must be a troll? Right? Because there is NO WAY warlocks are even close to mages on any level.<br />

It has been said a million times already. If you let the warlock cast a chaos bolt on you then you are either;<br />
<br />
1. Very bad for letting him build up a cast that long or<br />
<br />
2. Insanely outplayed by the warlock.<br />
<br />
Both cases makes it right for the warlock to fk you up with a chaos bolt.<br />
<br />
Also.. Both Chaos Bolt AND insane dot damage? Yeah... try harder mate :)<br />

In the end its all about learning to play!<br />

They aren't the best healers. Resto druids are better and have been since beta. If they nerf KFC, you will see a lot less holy paladins in arena.</div></div><hr />

The next thing would be to make Elite gear PURELY cosmetic. This isn't PvE where gear is everything, in PvP I believe players should all have an equal footing in terms of stats, etc, but you still need to climb up there. <br />
<br />
For example, doing your 2v2, 3v3, 5v5, and RBGs will still reward conquest points to be spent and a higher rating will allow you to purchase gear quicker, but not better gear than the rest of the players, just some sweet looking Transmog gear! Keep it up Blizzard!<br />

<br />
While Warlock chaos bolt damage is pretty intense (I'm in full dread with 5 mal pieces) and I get crit usually around 105k-190k with a bolt. That's a third to more than half my health, it is rather high, but you gotta rely on your team mates for interrupts and CC. This game isn't balanced for 1v1, hell barely for 3v3. <br />
<br />
I would like to see a nerf to their self-healing. I've taken 490k warlocks down to a sliver of health and then they are magically back at half their hp, then I'm feared and they are siphoning my health. It can be real rough, but they can be beat! I'm a fire mage btw. Fight fire with fire right ;) (dot's and burst)</div></div><hr />

Have you looked at the elite armor sets vs the normal conquest armor sets? It already is only cosmetic. Only the elite weapons are actual upgrades.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has been said a million times already. If you let the warlock cast a chaos bolt on you then you are either;<br />
<br />
1. Very bad for letting him build up a cast that long or<br />
<br />
2. Insanely outplayed by the warlock.<br />
<br />
Both cases makes it right for the warlock to fk you up with a chaos bolt.<br />
<br />
Also.. Both Chaos Bolt AND insane dot damage? Yeah... try harder mate :)<br />
<br />
In the end its all about learning to play!<br />
<br />
(And before you rage and call me a warlock i can tell you that im only playing druid!)<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe you should learn your classes better because everything you just said was bullshit. Let me guess, you're a resto druid who doesn't pay any attention to anything but how much health someone has?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The warlock concern with Chaos Bolt is primarily an issue in battlegrounds, where it is simply impossible for you to lock down every chaos bolt while keeping tags on the healers, flag, whatever the hell else. Other than that I stand on that getting a Chaos Bolt in your face really IS a problem on your end, not the warlock's end. Furthermore, it's pretty much all warlocks have got at the moment. Unfortunately, Affliction has never been in a worse state, and destro higher-end really is barely viable at all (of course, it is extremely viable in lower brackets because people don't interrupt :D). Next patch may bring some relief for affliction, but that is to be seen yet.</div></div><hr />

Anyone seen Swifty's latest videos on fastest kill times with various classes against a druid? BM Hunter was way down the list, barely beating a Resto druid in cat form. Meanwhile, Arms warrior with 5 stacks of Taste for Blood, he two shotted the druid which took less than 1 second. for the hunter - 4.27 seconds.<br />

If you aren't watching warrior taste for blood stacks and have zero aware ness that he has 5; you deserve to get hit by a 250k heroic strike. Pay attention to the enemie buff and CC him noob.</div></div><hr />

Im pretty confident in how well i know my classes and their specs and i also dont need to prove anything to someone who think they know stuff.<br />
Everything i said is true from an arena pooint of view which is the ONLY way to measure pvp balance in wow. Go finish that duel and cry some more :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've already made numerous nerfs to Hunters, rightfully so, but seem to still be working on day 1 MoP or live builds for balancing, not 5.1 like they should be. Stampede popped, AoE CC such as a root, fear bomb, or freeze. BW popped, CC the hunter and/or pet. So that leaves just Rapid Fire as our CD for the pvp power. Countering a 5.1, or hell a live, CD alignment isn't hard. Worst comes to worst, jump from high ground to low ground and ta-da, pets still have to run after you burning precious CD time.<br />
<br />
Hunter representation is high because of day 1 MoP. Saying that we're still OP, especially with 5.1 coming, is just plain silly.<br />
<br />
They're already hit Warriors hard with a lot of stuff...and for the record I play with squishies, not any Warriors on my teams.<br />
<br />
Avatar is no longer snare immunity, just a snare break. This alone is MASSIVE, they can't run around unCC'd for gigantic periods of time. Gag Order doesn't work in PvP, also huge.<br />
<br />
As a healer, I tend to AGREE that Warrior damage isn't completely insane. It's high, don't get me wrong, but it's more the unrelenting pressure they can apply thanks to Avatar and Gag Order. With less mobility and less control, I think they'll be fine.<br />
<br />
BM Hunters like yourself on the other hand? Once Stampede is fixed we'll see how it feels, but right now teams with BM Hunters have COMPLETELY unhealable moments.<br />
<br />

I think the ratings inflation and gear improving are brilliant ideas.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of guys like me around that used to play 2500+ all the time, but now we're pretty casual in our playtime...it's hard to keep good relationships with the guys you need to work with to achieve those ratings when you don't play enough. It's really a refreshing idea to me, that while I'm let's say playing on a 2k skill level with my team, that we will someday see 2200 weapons and be able to upgrade gear and all that fun stuff.<br />
<br />
The gear improvements will be really nice as well. I can only assume here that by the end of a season, you'll be able to have a full set of either 476 gear through honor, or 496 (maybe even 503) gear through conquest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But they're actually admitting there are issues with specific classes, and far more importantly, they're actually admitting healers are probably broken, something that NEVER, EVER got even MENTIONED during the entirety of Cata.<br />
<br />
I guess we'll have to see how this patch goes. 3.0 during Wrath was terrible, but the Ulduar update turned WoW's PvP into the best it's ever been. Maybe we'll see a repeat here - even episodes suck, odd episodes are great, right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xbander</div><div class="date">2012-11-03, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, Gregg Street is concerned that now certain classes bursting neither takes skill, nor is fair play?!? Excuse me? Wait a second, what game do you work for? You've based entire classes around their ability to burst and claimed it's &quot;working as intended&quot; in pvp (Frost Mages, Retadins, Enh--ok so the last one is as of MoP) and NOW you're concerned about burst damage? This is the same guy who made sure that a raid of 10 Blood DKs could do Firelands, and Blood/Blood or Ass/Ass were nearly unkillable arena comps in Cata. This is just retarded, Greg. In pure Blizzard fashion, you halfwits absolve yourselves of any foreknowledge of possible problems. A shrug of the shoulders and &quot;Gee, we didn't see that coming...who knew?&quot;. <br />
<br />
I don't play a Hunter, but I sure don't crap myself when I see one in an arena. Their sudden burst damage is more of a shock than a problem, considering you've made sure entire specs were centered around bursting. You should be more interested in cranking up the damage or control of other classes that are NOT viable arena specs. And Warrior burst damage is really all they have at the moment. Everyone was terrified of Dragon Roar until they got gear and saw it no longer one-shotted them. Warriors don't have steady damage because they're always getting peeled off their target or having everything dodged/parried. Bursting is the only way to get up to par. Now tell me, if you take away Gag Order, how is a Warrior going to apply pressure? Stormbolt is your answer? Nobody in their right mind trades Avatar for that. You said a caster should be able to CC a Warrior, get away, and get off a few free casts. It's not like Gag Order stops that from happening, it only means that cloth casters must now up their skill instead of cackling &quot;Oh it's just a warrior, lol no problem, I'll just nuke it&quot;.</div></div><hr />
