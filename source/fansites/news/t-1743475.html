Armory Stats - Legendary Quest Line Achievements<br />
Today we are taking a look at the legendary quest achievement completion rate of players. The data used today is a sample of 6.1 million characters from 3.1 million accounts. We also did this at the end of 2013 for Mists of Pandaria, which you can see here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3644-Armory-Stats-Legendary-Quest-Achievements-Blue-Tweets-IV-Contest-Voting).<br />

Archaeology Tab Progress Fix<br />
It looks like the Archaeology fix isn't done just yet. <br />
Thank you for your reports so far guys, they have all been forwarded on for further investigation. We'll post back here once we have updates to share. In the meantime, please remember to submit the following information if your Archaeology progress has NOT been fixed:<br />
<br />
<br />
Character name and realm<br />
Did you recently perform a character service on the affected character? If so, what was the character service and when was it performed?<br />
What progress are you missing?<br />
What skill level did you lose?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Class Changes<br />
Hotfixes continue to make minor to moderate class changes where appropriate. Depending on what you're referring to it could be a change we'd need to make in a patch, and patch schedules are set pretty far in advance. We're not quite ready yet to begin discussing changes for 6.2, but certainly you can follow along for the hotfixes that are being made, look forward to future patch announcements, and share your feedback here in the appropriate forum.

.Why does the Windwalker movespeed aura not stack with the passive portion of Pursuit of Justice?<br />
It's by design. From the Pursuit of Justice tooltip: “This does not stack with most other movement speed increasing effects.” (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578337646260330497))<br />

the rogue talent Shuriken Toss' auto-attacks only apply lethal poisens? Is this intended?<br />
Yes, only lethal poisons. This was inadvertently left out of the tooltip. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578334625535115264))<br />

thx for all the heirloom upgrades/tab. Any plans to convert existing plate to str/int like wod add int plate for pallys?<br />
We don’t currently have plans to do that. We like heirlooms being targeted to specific roles. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578334442877423616))<br />

is crit chance reduced versus raid bosses?<br />
Crit chance is affected by the target’s level, yes. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578333770459185152))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
When does the 18sec window start? At the beginning of first cc, end of the 3rd cc? It'd be awesome, if that was specified.<br />
It starts each time the crowd control effect is applied (e.g. the moment the target becomes stunned). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578252494360326144))<br />

I feel like it would have been more useful to have the polls be, &quot;What do you expect the price to be&quot; rather than what they'd pay for. :I<br />

LFR drops are _IDENTICAL_ to Normal/Heroic/Mythic. You can complete it just fine. Nothing influences the amount of quest items drop. For a ring that increases your DPS by ~5%, it's decent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone said they already announced the price. I think I missed that. All I have seen is the $20 for the token to start with. I have not seen in game price. Plus sounds like this will fluctuate. <br />

There is no way it will be that cheap, so there is no point in having that option. 10-20k is already lower than it will end up most likely. If you wouldn't pay 10k, there is a View Results button that allows you to see the results without voting.</div></div><hr />

This legendary quest is a disaster<br />
&gt;hyperbole<br />
<br />
can't play 3 days per week<br />
&gt;takes roughly 30min to do HM LFR and maybe about an hour, up to 2 max to clear BRF LFR<br />
<br />
LFR drops are bad<br />
&gt;same as Normal, HC and Mythic<br />
<br />
legendary itself (non visible ring) is also not a great reward.<br />
&gt;very good DPS increase, except that you can't see it graphically on your character until it becomes legendary<br />
<br />
by far the worst endgame content<br />
&gt;hyperbole again!<br />
<br />
working on alts and transmog but there will be a point when even that will dry out<br />
&gt;you have time for those but no time to do LFRs?<br />

Not everyone is going to feel it is worth their money or gold to use this system. That's fine. People like me will though. You see, I play wow as a hobby. It's something I enjoy doing during my off hours. I make around 80k a week just from logging on my 10 alts and doing the gold missions (each week I recruit another treasure hunter follower and disable one without it). I have 4 scavengers on each toon as well. They get me garry resources that I trade for dranic dust when its 4 resource per dust. That I then feed into enchanting hut and sell the shards on tuesdays. It seems like alot but it honestly takes about 5 min a day for each toon, so less than one hour a day to get 80k per week. And, like I said, I enjoy this among many other aspects of WoW. <br />
<br />
So for me it is a no brainer to buy these tokens, even in excess of 40k. The reason Blizz is doing this is they make 5$ extra for every token sold than they would have by base sub. So it's all about profit for them, but it works out for me to. Maybe it does not work out for you. That is OK, you just have to not use it. But there is no reason why I should not have the option just because it is not for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This legendary quest is a disaster, i simply cannot complete it because i actually can't play 3 days per week or dedicated evenings of raiding to it. LFR drops are bad and non stimulating and the legendary itself (non visible ring) is also not a great reward.<br />
<br />
this is really by far the worst endgame content they have ever put out and i hope this changes. For now i'm working on alts and transmog but there will be a point when even that will dry out.<br />
What are you even talking about?<br />
<br />
The legendary quest is WAY WAY easier than in mists.<br />
<br />
In 7 weeks I got 1 secret out of 20 in full ToT clears before they added guaranteed one from Lei Shen, that is 5% complete.<br />
<br />
In 6 weeks of BRF I am 611/900 and I have not done a full clear in a single week (8/10 atm) that is 70% complete in less time with less kills.<br />
<br />
Just stop with the hyperbole.</div></div><hr />

I definitely won't be selling any tokens for gold, but I have no idea if I might buy any or not. I don't expect that they'll sell for little enough gold to be worth it to me. But they might.</div></div><hr />

I'd think it is in line with progression in BRF overall.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that you need blackhands arm for the last part, which until today wasn't doable by a grand majority of characters.</div></div><hr />

Aside from the whole token thing, all I have done in Warlords is really leveled alts, run lfrs for my legendary, and worked professions. I agree that there is actually very little to do in Warlords. I don't want to level another toon, I don't want to gear another alt, and I am not interested in raiding more than once or twice a week, so really....what is there to do on the nights I don't? Nothing really, and I find myself not logging in more often than not these days. Patch 6.1 was kind of a joke. I guess one or two quests a day and a selfie camera were supposed to be fulfilling content? Because it wasn't. This expansion has really disappointed me, and so many people I've known have quit the game. I know there numbers are up right now, but that is something I see dropping drastically. Maybe I am wrong, but my opinion is Warlords is really lacking in content.</div></div><hr />

Oh, it's possible that most players with active accounts at the end of the expansion will have done the legendary chain, if only because so many others just quit.</div></div><hr />

What it most certainly does is giving a good idea of the gap of perspective between token sellers and buyers. 10-20K is what roughly half the people would want to pay. I highly doubt any seller would be willing to spent $20 to receive 10-20K gold. I think most sellers dont even value 20-30K enough.<br />
<br />
So I am curious as to what will happen. If the gold price will be set at 30-40K, demand will be lower. But if prices are going to drop, I can see supply dropping way much faster as we're talking people RL cash here.<br />
<br />
I am a potential seller. I have a good job, and I'm not afraid of spending RL cash on transfers, faction changes or race changes when I'm bored. I can easily miss $20 each month to generate some extra gold. Let it be said, I've never had issues generating gold. Spent roughly 300K this expansion so far, and only this week I dropped below 100K again. But it should be rewarding enough for me to sell tokens. 20K gold is not worth $20 IMHO.</div></div><hr />

We might not be at the end, but its not hard to figure out where we are going, given what we been given to date. I simply see more jumping puzzle and stuff attach to the garrison to make it so they still do not have to bend on the whole not letting people flying in this content. We might get couple daily hubs, because more people are now asking for them. More quest lines like the Harrison Jones ones, they were actually pretty decent once the masses got through them and it started to trickle down to a handful of people doing them.<br />
<br />
I doubt we see much actual content beyond 6.2, jury is still out if they will ever get to those other islands and such and even if they do they will probably be more on the lines of being used as catch up system for the coming expansion. This expansion has been largely about, How do we stretch out and maximize the little content that we create outside or raid content work to our advantage and continue to profit from that. As well as keep people guessing as to whether or not we are going to create more content or at least give the illusion that we might create more content to keep them on the hook for the long haul until the next expansion comes out.<br />
<br />
Its really not hard to see what and where we are going, 6.1 is showing the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the first 7 weeks of ToT I completed 5% of the items I needed for the FIRST part of the ToT part (I got 1 Secret in 7 weeks of full clears).<br />
<br />
In 6 weeks with zero full clears (currently 8/10) I have 70% of the items I need.<br />

<br />
<br />
Does not matter at this point how special something is, what matters the items that given at the end of the chain, the ring and the follower, both are not visible to other players, so they don't really show off anything special on the character itself. Personally, I am on the rune part and I believe I have around 140 or so of those. I have not been bothering to do BRF, I been spending my time leveling characters and doing old content, because its better than continuing to do the same thing every day on all the level 100 characters I presently have, which to date are 12. I don't really find the ring chain to be even as good as the cloak chain was, but then only being at the runes, it might get better by the end, if I bother to get there.<br />
<br />
Its been really hard to really get into playing this Timeless Isle type of expansion. I did not like the island one bit and I guess this content reflect what I did not like about it.</div></div><hr />

Nope. I think they are roughly the same. Many that started in time with the runes will be done this or next week. I don't think I needed longer for any type of fragment or stone during MoP.<br />
<br />
The only thing that changed is the inflation of numbers. You don't get 1...you get 9. You don't need 9...you need 90 or 900...of everything. Made 0 sense to increase stacks to 200 if you increase the number of drops(and items you need to produce anything) by factor 10 as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You gotta remember in HotS the most characters on screen will be like 10 (might be off by a bit), but in wow, you might see like 100+ characters at a time in a raid or in a major city. The models must be simpler to compensate for that otherwise it would too much for some machines to handle. Even the environments are all viewed downward in HotS, so they can delete alot of stuff you wont ever see (bottoms of trees, backs of buildings, etc). In wow you can see things from every angle, so they have less ways they can reduce the number of polygons screen. SO they tend to make wow look less detailed and lower poly count because of this. I know some people's machines can handle this with no problem, but they design wow to look as good as it can on lower end machines. HotS is very focused in what you see on screen at a time, if you had the same freedom you did in WoW to look around I'm sure people would notice a ton of visual issues.</div></div><hr />

They are guaranteed to get at least 9 from every single boss each reset, sometimes 18, once you have done it on your main your alts are guaranteed 18 each boss.<br />
<br />
At start of ToT nothing was guaranteed at all trust me Mists was way way worse.<br />
<br />
Now if your comparing how it was at the end of mists to now, then sure its about the same but you have to wait till the end of warlords to compare the drop rates to the end of mists as they will more than likely up everything again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed, anyone who thinks these things are going to sell for 20k gold or less has never been to the BMAH. People pay 500k gold for a mount they will barely use, you don´t think they are going to buy tokens and save some real life money?<br />
<br />
Anything under 50k is a dream, more than likely they will be at 100k for at least the first few months. There are way too many players with a ton of gold and a ton of inactive accounts with inactive gold waiting to buy these things. Demand is going to be huge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What people don´t understand is that supply and demand is not about averages, it is about the price point where demand and supply intercept.<br />
<br />
20 people want to buy tokens for gold. 10 of them say they will pay 10k gold for them. 10 say they will pay 50k gold for them.<br />
10 people sell the tokens.<br />
<br />
The price is not going to be 25k or 30k.. the price is going to be 50k.<br />
<br />
There are going to be a huge number of people willing to buy these things for 100k gold. It does´t matter if 75% of people say they will only pay 10k<br />
<br />
There are hundreds or even thousands of people who have been gold-capped for 2 or 3 expansions with nothing to spend their gold on. Those guys are going to be buying these things for 100k without batting an eye and they are going to be the ones who are setting the price point for a long time until they run out of gold.<br />
<br />
The number of people who have more gold than they know what to do with is vastly greater than the number of people who would sell a token for 50k.</div></div><hr />

It absolutely does not speak for each and every single person that pays to play the game. There are literally millions of people we have seen no opinion from. Once we get each and every one of those opinions, then we can start stating facts.<br />
<br />
*woosh* What he means, is if you look at the previous poll, more people who respond to these polls have 5+ lvl 100 characters, while most plays only have 1 lvl 100 character. So we represent a vocal minority. So these polls do not reflect the average WoW players opinion, and are probably why people here are so whiny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
20 people want to buy tokens for gold. 10 of them say they will pay 10k gold for them. 10 say they will pay 50k gold for them.<br />
10 people sell the tokens.<br />
<br />
The price is not going to be 25k or 30k.. the price is going to be 50k.<br />
<br />
There are going to be a huge number of people willing to buy these things for 100k gold. It does´t matter if 75% of people say they will only pay 10k<br />
<br />
There are hundreds or even thousands of people who have been gold-capped for 2 or 3 expansions with nothing to spend their gold on. Those guys are going to be buying these things for 100k without batting an eye and they are going to be the ones who are setting the price point for a long time until they run out of gold.<br />
<br />
The number of people who have more gold than they know what to do with is vastly greater than the number of people who would sell a token for 50k.<br />
<br />
50k gold for 1 month or even 2 months is highway robbery, guess i'll stick with the goldsellars in trade chat since its 10k-12k for 1 mnth of gametime.</div></div><hr />

It is not. This shouldn't be accessible through cheap means - a month of free play time should be something deserved. Beside, as the polls show, there's a greater number of people who'd pay gold than those who'd pay money. So you have to be logical - the price definitely won't be around the 10~12k gold mark - too many people would have a free month. The price will, most likely, be around the 50k and more likely to go up once the initial burst is gone.</div></div><hr />

cmon man be real... the bolded parts are just hilarious to read... do you think that the wow token is some new and miraculous thing? ppl have been doing that (getting free time) for YEARS now... only thing Blizzard is doing is jumping on the deal and increasing the price...50k + for 20$ when you can have the same deal with less money...<br />
and its easier to pay 12.99$ for a sub than making all that gold you want for some ppl...<br />

- should be more than average player makes in gold/month<br />
- can't cost to much gold because of the relation of pay to win<br />
$20 -&gt; gold. Gold -&gt; BMAH...... Won't be a wise idea to give players like 500K gold / token.<br />
- I would set the range between 80-200k gold depends on demand.<br />
<br />
Don't forget the tokens are available region wide! The main point of the token is $ profit for Blizz b, ut it can be a great gold sink as well. <br />
<br />
Endgame: correct me if I'm wrong but Blizz stated 2 raid tier for this xpac right? HM and BF considered 1 raid tier. So we are far from the so called end game content. <br />
<br />
Legendary: named wrongly the MANDATOY would suit better for this extremly high ilvl pieces. Any pug leader will pick ppl with higher ilvl for the same role....<br />
<br />
I love the story, the scenarios doable (so far did on mage/ druid). I remember some wow friends gave up in mop legendary because of the difficulity of the scenarios. So I would say it's ok to have it in the game but it's sad as the whole expansion built up on that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's an interesting sentiment, since generally the people buying the gold will be setting the price through simple demand causing the price to more than likely skyrocket driving the gold sellers out of business or resulting in them having to raise their prices to comepete. The system is meant for people who are rich, not nickel and dimers who complain about parting with 50k. I complain that the value of the gold however is going to cheapen, and I'm not interested in trading it for gametime since I pay my sub legitimately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, Einstein, compare what you can do now with what you will be able to do after this goes into effect. You will NOT be able to buy gametime for 12k gold after this starts, and you probably can´t right now either. The ONLY reason gold-sellers are selling you gametime for 12k is because they are able to sell that gold for $20. Let me make it more obvious for you.<br />
<br />
I have $20 and want to buy gold.<br />
<br />
I can go to Blizzard store, buy a token and sell it for 60k<br />
I can go to 3rd party website and buy 25k and risk my account being banned and my credit card stolen.<br />
<br />
In order for those 3rd party sites to get my business, they are going to have to offer me more than 60k gold for my $20....which means.... wait for it... there is no way they are going to turn around and sell you gametime for 12k gold. They are going to have to sell you gametime for MORE than the price of the tokens (because of the safety premium).<br />
<br />
Now from a business standpoint, they also have operating costs (probably cheap, but still they have some bills they must pay). So not only do they lose some money because they have to pay a safety premium over what Blizzard sells the tokens for, but they also have to have some type of profit just to pay their bills... both of those things put them at a competitive disadvantage to Blizzard.<br />
<br />
For Blizzard, they can actually lose a little money on this entire process and it will still be a net gain because they will be crushing gold-sellers which will drastic reduce the amount of money they have been spending on customer service for hacked accounts.<br />
<br />
TLDR.. just because you used to be able to buy gametime for a certain amount before, does not mean you will be able to do it after this change. Blizzard has every advantage in the ´gold-selling´ business compared to illegal sites.</div></div><hr />

I don't really understand your point. If you believe that the wow token is going to sell for 20k or less, you're up for a huge deception. It's a simple economical theory called supply and demand. If pieces of gear sells for 50k gold, I do not see how a month of game time would sell for less. You act like if this is something that should be available for everyone. It is not - it's luxury. <br />
<br />
Either you have the gold - or the money - or you don't and you don't get it.</div></div><hr />

Wrong. The guaranteed drop is 9. The bonus drop gives 27 total (which means 18 more, not 18 total) and the alt bonus is always 4 regardless if you get bonus runes or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would suspect a large number back when heroics were relevant, with a huge falloff once LFR got rolling.<br />

<br />
<br />
Nope. I think they are roughly the same. Many that started in time with the runes will be done this or next week. I don't think I needed longer for any type of fragment or stone during MoP.<br />
<br />
The only thing that changed is the inflation of numbers. You don't get 1...you get 9. You don't need 9...you need 90 or 900...of everything. Made 0 sense to increase stacks to 200 if you increase the number of drops(and items you need to produce anything) by factor 10 as well.<br />
<br />
I'm not subbed, and when i was, I only did the quest up until I had to go into heroics (nope, not going into those, sorry, no ring for me)(I swore off pugged content for WoD), but looking at the requirements, it looks the same as the Cloak - same time to get all the drops, but with more rng for the runes, to replace the valor and PvP steps of the cloak chain. The amount of valor for the cloak, before they nerfed it, was a numbingly large amount.<br />
<br />
They're going to stretch this out, you know they are. They don't want everyone getting the ring right away. Same as anything else, there's no surprise here.</div></div><hr />

But $20 for maybe 25K doesn't cut it either for sellers. If the gold amount you receive is too low, this selling market just isn't interesting. Barely supply means high demand, means high gold cost for those few tokens that do excist, but high gold costs means nobody's buying either.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that sellers get the amount they listed it for, that price set at that point simply doesn't drop anymore, meaning the system makes the market get stuck.</div></div><hr />

Good. Legendaries are meant to be earned, not handed out like candy. You chose to not sacrifice work to work on your legendary, so of course the progress will be much slower. And be thankful that LFR even allows you to progress on it, whereas it should have been made that LFR won't allow you to progress on it, like the Legendary Dagger quest line in late Cata.<br />

<br />
No freaking way it will be 250k. I will buy 40 game tokens if it's 250k gold. It's going to be closer to the 50-100k range. <br />
For myself, at 50k I'd buy 1 token maybe a year. At 100k I'll buy 1 token a month.</div></div><hr />
