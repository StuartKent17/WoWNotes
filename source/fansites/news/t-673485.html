You can now query for a list of completed quests with “QueryQuestsCompleted()” then wait for the “QUEST_QUERY_COMPLETE” event, and call “GetQuestsCompleted(&lt;luatable&gt;)”.<br />

At the same time, I'm a little bummed about the name change to Oswald. I was really liking his name, but I know that many people preferred Mr. Chilly. So, I guess there were more who preferred that, over Oswald. I'll love him all the same, though! <br />

<br />
* Create Soulstone: The cooldown on this spell and duration of its buff have been lowered from 30 minutes down to 15 minutes. Cannot be used in Arenas. <br />
<br />
I don't really understand this change. The lowering of the cd is nice, but why the duration, too? I'm not really looking forward to having to cast ss on myself every fifteen minutes, rather than every 30. Especially now, when they still cost a soul shard. <br />
<br />
Edit: To clarify, I definitely see now that this is mostly to help with raiding and I can fully understand and appreciate the reduction of the cd. That sounded nice from the get-go. I just wonder why they're also reducing the duration of the buff. Seems like if they just changed the cd, that this would fix the wait for a new ss, during raids and after wipes. While, if they kept the duration of the buff the same, it would make it much nicer for when you aren't raiding and you're simply farming or questing. I'm by no means lazy, but having to SS every fifteen minutes, just doesn't sound as appealing as every half hour. <br />
<br />
I'd simply enjoy the lowered cd, so that if I did need to ss sooner than every thirty minutes, I could. But, if I didn't, I could relax and know that I wouldn't have to reset my ss for a half an hour. <br />
<br />
But, no worries, honestly. All the changes sound great and I'm looking forward to hearing everything else that's to come! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, I guess. It still just feels like a bit more of a hindrance to me, more than anything else. '<br />
<br />
'Cause, when would you honestly die that much, so quickly? It specifies that it can't be used in Arena, and I don't know about other Warlocks, but I very very rarely use an ss in BGs. And, so, that only leaves world pvp. And, I don't usually get ganked or die enough to warrant wanting to ss every fifteen minutes. Especially when I'm farming, I sort of see this as bit of a bummer. I would enjoy a reduction on the cd, but not the duration of the buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
'Cause, when would you honestly die that much, so quickly? It specifies that it can't be used in Arena, and I don't know about other Warlocks, but I very very rarely use an ss in BGs. And, so, that only leaves world pvp. And, I don't usually get ganked or die enough to warrant wanting to ss every fifteen minutes. Especially when I'm farming, I sort of see this as bit of a bummer. I would enjoy a reduction on the cd, but not the duration of the buff. <br />
<br />
<br />
Its called raiding. You are aware that if you fail on a boss, waiting only 15 mins is a huge thing to have another SS. Or having the soulstoned person die on a fight, but now you just have to wait 15 mins to use it again.<br />
<br />
I don't get why you are complaining about a buff. I see a bigger issue why you feel the need to keep a soulstone up on yourself constantly. If you can do it every 30 mins, just do it every 15 mins. Its no more an annoyance then keeping one up on you all the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I see now that it's a raiding thing. Don't ask me, but it just honestly did not dawn on me, at first. Probably because I don't have the availability to raid, so my mind when straight to pvp. Thanks a heap, everyone!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glyph of Shadow +30% from spirit? Combined with Glyph of SW:P and haste changes inc shadow dps! And yes all this spirit in my gear suddenly makes sense!<br />
<br />
And nice that all the raid utility spells are given a cd reduction in a way that doesn't make affect arena balance. It can save a lot of time for people who do heroic raids and sometimes don't even bother a try if soulstones and rebirths are not available (and yes I feel they should be on a timer so as to be available reasonably often, you should be able to count on basic utility skills of your raid).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The obvious is of course:<br />
+ now affects all spells (not just the GCD for RJ/LB/WG)<br />
- longer GCD for the above<br />
<br />
Right now I have 17 % haste. With the change I would have 27 % instead.<br />
<br />
GCD / cast times before and after change:<br />
<br />
GCD (RJ/LB/WG) ... before: 1.03 ... after: 1.18<br />
GCD (others) ... before: 1.28 ... after: 1.18<br />
Nourish ... before: 1.28 ... after: 1.18<br />
Regrowth ... before: 1.71 ... after: 1.57<br />
HT (talented) ... before: 2.56 ... after: 2.36<br />
HT (normal) ... before: 2.99 ... after: 2.76<br />
<br />
So blanketing the raid with Rejuv gets a slight nerf.<br />
<br />
On the other hand the ideas about making HoTs tick faster with haste would be interesting. I am seeing a lot of overhealing because other healers see a health deficit and heal the same targets as me. (though that usually happens when healing isn't coordinated, like in pugs)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Wow, way to be rude. I wasn't complaining, I was saying that I didn't understand the change and simply expressing that I sort of disliked that the duration of the buff was changing, as well. If the whole point of this change is to make it so that after a wipe, ss can be used sooner, the reduction of the cc fixes just that. There's no need to reduce the duration of the buff. Do you see what I'm saying? Cause, not everything revolves around raiding, nor pvp, nor casual play. They all count and all have their purpose and fun for most people. <br />
<br />
All I said, was that I liked the reduction of the cooldown, however, I wasn't as thrilled about the reduction of the buff duration. <br />
<br />
I didn't throw some sort of ridiculous tantrum about it or QQ all over the place. I just said that I didn't get it, really, and that it wasn't my ideal way of having ss work, basically. But, we'll see how it goes. No worries. <br />
<br />
Also, I don't know about you, but I play on a pvp server and when I'm out farming and/or questing, it's pretty irresponsible of me to not have an ss up. And, I know few 'locks who don't in said circumstances. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure, but I'm thinking you might need a nap?</div></div><hr />

You don't need any extra information aside from that anyway. Addons like QH already have a huge database of QuestID -&gt; QuestData, which one could assume would contain location information.<br />

Also, as a bastardized SP (Aff Lock) am I the only one a little frustrated by the implementation of haste and DoTs? SPs have haste applied to ALL their DoTs via Shadowform (which is completely reasonable), Aff Locks have 3 DoTs and we have to sacrifice a major glyph slot to have haste benefit 1. I know Blizz has said they would be &quot;experimenting&quot; with the implementation of haste's affect on DoTs, but really?<br />

I'm worried about this - Blizzards engine is rubbish when it comes to clipping, it takes way to much processing power and drops the fps across the line. This may very well introduce even more overhead...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is a good thing!<br />
<br />
For a start, most bosses in raids now have a 10 minute enrage anyway so it will generally only be available once per fight.<br />
It just means that if you wipe or get to the next boss, your druid's battle res is available much sooner.<br />
<br />
Blizz are trying to make it so that people that can only play a short amount of time each night get a fair chance to raid still and this is another (small but significant) change towards doing just that :)<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;Any party member may mark raid targets&quot;, I would guess that means only when in a party, not a raid.<br />
I know it says raid targets, but the actual icons are called raid target icons anyway.<br />
<br />
This would probably be designed for the fact that in cross battleground instances, the leader of the group gets a &quot;bonus&quot; of some sort. This way, the tank wouldn't have to be the leader...<br />
<br />
And if someone starts screwing around with party target icons in a pug, you know it's time to find another group.<br />
<br />
*edit. I can't log on to PTR to test any of this as it doesnt like my account name or password so of course this is only my opinion. But it would seem to make sense why they're doing this. I think the next step would maybe be an option for the group leader to assign a &quot;marker&quot; instead of allowing everyone to mark. Time will tell what Blizzard decide to do with this option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Totally agree. Elemental shamans only use flameshock to refresh the dot. The dot lasts 18 seconds, so we would lose 3 seconds of that dot to refresh the totem buff. The T9 2p bonus is totally incompatible with this as well since it adds 9 seconds to the flameshock dot. Unless... someone can figure a way to add Earthshock into the rotation. Also, this would be much better if it was spellpower instead of crit.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it. Critical Strike Rating isn't a terrible stat by far, but just using simple EP values, it still is only worth around 1.8 EP. Although, I think on some fights it could be worthwhile to switch depending on mechanics and the fact that Shocks are ranged and SS is not :P.<br />
<br />
You could probably test this easily by simply adding a flat 438 AP (and the appropriate spellpower) or adding 219 critical strike rating and removing whatever totem you have and then testing it in the simulator. It isn't perfect, because technically the crit totem would add up faster because shocks are only on a 5-6 second cooldown (depending on reverb levels) but Stormstrike is on a 8 second cooldown. So it will take 12s to stack one and 16s to stack the other, but you could sort of ignore this slight ramp up time to see the overall potency.<br />
<br />
But at first glance, I'd rather use the Enhancement totem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it may end up used by enhancement, afterall. Based on my alt shaman knowledge (which still has its holes), haste becomes the best stat after a certain point for fights without too much running around/time at range.</div></div><hr />

Well no shit Sherlock! Hence the necessary need to Buff Shadow Priests to bring their DPS up to par somewhat to other DPS classes - keep your moronic sentiments to yourself.<br />
<br />
But you seem to be just some ignorant kid who's got no concept of how a Shadow Priest plays like - they require hell of a lot more thought to pull off their DPS compared to other classes like Mages and Warlocks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're probably correct about it being prudent to swap out totems depending on the fight. My current concern is that, if you take a full SS cooldown (8 seconds) and then assume that all three attacks with higher priority than Stormstrike come off cooldown (Feral Spirit, MW5-LB, and ES w/ SS debuff already applied) and a full 1.5s global cooldown, you're looking at 8 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 12.5 second interlude between Stormstrike casts. Given even a latency of 500, you might get dangerously close to the full 15 seconds of the buff, resulting in the entire stack dropping off; which WOULD be a significant DPS lose. It sounds fairly unlikely, but I can imagine it happening more than infrequently. Of course, to combat this, you could make a mental note when casting ES w/ SS debuff that SS debuff only has &lt; 4 seconds left and that SS might warrant priority over that last ES. But given the fact that you JUST cast MW5-LB (and the average stack-time for MW5 is closer to 4-5 seconds, according to EJ), it's entirely likely that the only source of damage that you'd lose out on from the SS debuff dropping off before you recast would be a Static Shock proc. A sacrifice that would definitely be compensated for by getting one last ES off on the SS debuff.<br />
<br />
Of course, all this could be avoided by just going for the Ele totem as max interlude between ES in the same scenario is 6 seconds (untalented shock cooldown) + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 (assuming in this case, that SS debuff is not applied so SS takes priority over the next ES) = 10.5 seconds, which completely guarantees that you can get another ES off before the totem buff stack falls off (unless you're terribad... like me). <br />
<br />
Just my random musings; I'm sure the numbers will be crunched and that the Enhance totem will come out far ahead. The prospect of 219 crit rating = ~5% crit got me all excited. Oh wellz.<br />
<br />

From Ghost crawler himself:<br />

We were concerned that a really short cooldown on an ability that rezzes you and only rezzes you would lead to bizarre behavior. Shamans could just commit suicide every fight knowing that they could come back. Standing in the fire too long? No problem. Too far away from where you want to be? Just die. Out of mana? Just die. Yes you might lose dps or healing time, but we still think it would happen and we think it would look weird.<br />
<br />
Soulstone by comparison can easily be used on the &quot;wrong&quot; person (if they don't die) and Rebirth can't be used at all if the druid dies. In some ways, Reincarnation is the only cooldown that you are guaranteed to see every fight as soon as it becomes that dependable.<br />

This makes the amount of haste to reach a 1sec GCD incredibly higher. <br />
This may sound like a bad thing but it's already very easy to reach. With gear inflation in ICC we should be able to attain it but we'll actually have to try. <br />
I forgot the number exactly, but it's a few hundred haste rating higher.<br />
So, haste gear in ICC will far outweigh the crit gear to reach our 1sec GCD. Once we reach that number, not only will we have the GCD - but our casts on Regrowth and Nourish will be incredibly fast with the GotEM change.<br />

The ability hasn't been changed in any significant way aside from the way it is applied, so why aren't Shadowpriests the best AoE healers in the game already? Because the way you described it is not how the ability works.</div></div><hr />

Vampiric Embrace with Improved Vampiric Embrace heals for 5% of damage done on people who aren't you.<br />
<br />
Also it didn't change the functionality, before it was a five minute debuff you would have to cast on the target, now it's just a self buff, so it can be up during trash or boss fights without having to renew it. This is a convenience buff.</div></div><hr />

Yep.... a 15 second immunity where you can cast as many heals as you want is sooo much better than dying ten seconds into the fight, and then getting back up to heal/dps for the remaining 5-6 minutes.</div></div><hr />

So, haste gear in ICC will far outweigh the crit gear to reach our 1sec GCD. Once we reach that number, not only will we have the GCD - but our casts on Regrowth and Nourish will be incredibly fast with the GotEM change.<br />
<br />
<br />
My math may have been a bit off, since I haste rating is additive and haste percentage is multiplicative.<br />
<br />
I redid some of my math. One will need 50% haste to reach 1 s GCD:<br />
<br />
Celestial Focus: 3%<br />
Improved Moonkin Aura: 3%<br />
Wrath of Air Totem: 5%<br />
Gift of the Earthmother: 10%<br />
<br />
So assuming my math is correct this time it would require 22.5% haste from gear to achieve 50% total haste.<br />
<br />
1.225 * 1.03 * 1.03 * 1.05 * 1.10 = 1.50 ie 50% haste<br />
<br />
With no points in Celestial Focus one will need 26.1% haste from gear. instead<br />
<br />
Without any raid buffs it starts at 36.4% assuming 5/5 GotEM.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, our crit rating will suck ass but our casts will be super fast and we will still have our 1sec GCD.<br />
With that much haste rating though... would glyph of rejuvenation be worth it? I'd like to see the theorycrafted numbers on that when they come up. It seems interesting.<br />
<br />
<br />
In my personal opinion I doubt it. I've always felt that when someone is below 50% health I want to heal them up asap and not have to wait 3 s for each tick.<br />
<br />
If they were to make HoTs tick faster with haste on the other hand...</div></div><hr />

I will never understand this mindset. Why people are so hard-on on Arthas? It was a character that was developed in one game of the franchise, not even mentioned in the rest. Like every other villain, it was developed so it could be defeated by the heroes.<br />

your 3rd shock will have the 3 stack up, and as long as you shock once every 14 seconds after that it will stay up, so how is this useless?</div></div><hr />

Gift of the Earthmother now increases your total spell haste by 2/4/6/8/10%<br />
<br />
considering that with 0 haste u have 100% casting speed and with 20% haste u have 120% casting speed, doesn't this talent increase TOTAL spell haste like 120% *110%=132%, that means that instead of 130% haste u have 132% haste so the more haste u have the more this talent gives u?<br />

this makes alot fo diff to the crit it said initially, just hoping this update is correct of its like <br />
T7 naxx totem of hex =get<br />
T8 ulduar thunderfall totem=pvp ignore for pve<br />
T9 ToC totem of electrifying wind= get<br />
T10 ICC= dont get<br />

Shadow is already not the easiest spec to play well. Haste affecting all the dots will make the specs priority system even harder to manage, especially with 4pT10 (which may well push Mind Blast out of the window dpswise, making it a loss for us to keep replenishment up (or even talent imp MB).<br />
<br />
<br />
Making it harder to play is a bonus. Facerolling is not fun, and anything that increases the gap between beginner and professional play is good for the game-experience. Though I share your concern about MB becoming obsolete except for keeping replenishment up.</div></div><hr />

I know blizzard wants us to use all of our 3 healing spells, they even wanted us to think about the Judgement of Light heal on the tier9gear.<br />
I think blizzard just havent seen a really good paladin healer on movies or whatever, cuz afaik most of all paladins just spamm holy light like madmen.<br />
This is the only reason why we get those kinds of shit libralms and pretty bad setbonuses. Just dunno why blizzard did this one, maybe cuz ppl forgot to use holy shock or something. But imo, we havent forgot it, we just use it as a Swiftmend if someone is close to death, but I guess you want it in a kind of rotation. Isnt it better if you just remake the Holy Relic to affect flash of light and holy shock, cuz afaik ppl will still spamm holy light, but this actually makes it more usefull then just trying to use holy shock every cd just for the heck of it.<br />
<br />
GOOD PALAS USE HOLY SHOCK, But we dont wanna use it for fun, we wanna save it for special situations. <br />
(example, the whole raid is taking 3k dmg each, Using holy shock and at the same time the tank is getting hit superhard, we will have the holy shock on cd. and he/she will die)<br />
<br />
See what I mean, Its about using the right heal for the right situations and not to just use all your spells.<br />
<br />
The libralm could even be, &quot;When you use Holy Shock or Flash of Light you gain &quot;Light's lol&quot;, which stacks 3 times, When you have 3 stacks your Holy Light spell cost 50% less mana. Or whatever.</div></div><hr />

For follers pvp librams are better.<br />
<br />
<br />
yes. <br />
<br />
ive grown rather tired of the lackluster approach they make tword librams. granted-i dont think they should be op, but i mean, atleast put some thought into it maybe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HotsPal</div><div class="date">2009-10-14, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know blizzard wants us to use all of our 3 healing spells, they even wanted us to think about the Judgement of Light heal on the tier9gear.<br />
I think blizzard just havent seen a really good paladin healer on movies or whatever, cuz afaik most of all paladins just spamm holy light like madmen.<br />
This is the only reason why we get those kinds of shit libralms and pretty bad setbonuses. Just dunno why blizzard did this one, maybe cuz ppl forgot to use holy shock or something. But imo, we havent forgot it, we just use it as a Swiftmend if someone is close to death, but I guess you want it in a kind of rotation. Isnt it better if you just remake the Holy Relic to affect flash of light and holy shock, cuz afaik ppl will still spamm holy light, but this actually makes it more usefull then just trying to use holy shock every cd just for the heck of it.<br />
<br />
GOOD PALAS USE HOLY SHOCK, But we dont wanna use it for fun, we wanna save it for special situations. <br />
(example, the whole raid is taking 3k dmg each, Using holy shock and at the same time the tank is getting hit superhard, we will have the holy shock on cd. and he/she will die)<br />
<br />
See what I mean, Its about using the right heal for the right situations and not to just use all your spells.<br />
<br />
The libralm could even be, &quot;When you use Holy Shock or Flash of Light you gain &quot;Light's lol&quot;, which stacks 3 times, When you have 3 stacks your Holy Light spell cost 50% less mana. Or whatever.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A. Its a stupid buff to even give us-i mean 3 stacks for spell power is kinda dumb to begin with on a holy pally. <br />
B. Who uses shock every cooldown to even get 3 stacks, or maintain it?<br />
C. And the 4 piece t10 bonus is retarded also. Shock gives you a .3 sec less HL cast time. wow, a .3 sec cast time reduction on HL. you could achieve that by socketing one haste gem. <br />
<br />
what is with the focus on shock? its useful you need to plop one quick heal, its useless to put into a 'rotation', seeing as how pallys dont have a rotation.</div></div><hr />
