For The Horde (http://www.for-the-horde.de) went in Coilfang with a GM and had a try on the new Vashj .... They dropped something very interesting. (It wasn't a legit kill, according to a member of the raid the encounter still needs massive tuning to be manageable with the 2.1.0 consumables changes)<br />
<br />

<br />
So you might ask ... What's the use ? Easy, you can use this scroll to attune someone to Serpentshrine Cavern instantly, no quest, nothing (You use it like any other scroll, if you still can't really understand, think about a Scroll of Stamina). Kael'thas will also drop an item of the same kind.<br />
<br />
The other loots were (+ Nether Vortexes, Tier 5 tokens)<br />
[Coral Band of the Revived]<br />
[Ring of Endless Coils]</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-05-20, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Droprate is probably 100% (but can't be confirmed, there was only one kill)<br />
<br />
Of course it doesnt have unlimited uses, otherwise you could get all Shattrath attuned with a single scroll. I don't know if it's stackable but I guess it's easily checkable in the game infos, check wowhead tomorrow :p</div></div><hr />

Okay attunement may be a problem serveral months from now, but right now i don't see the use for it other than people begin to skip content. <br />
<br />
From my knowledge things like onyxia scale was also first implemented after onyxia was killed the first time. So people that wanted to kill nefarian had to wait to gear their guild up. Also in retro wow i have never heard of guilds that completely skipped MC (unless they had already done it before), so why should guilds want to skip karazhan or gruul for that matter. And the attunement for serpentshrine is really not that hard if you are in a raiding guild, i can understand if they want to do something similar for the eye, since that attunement can be a killer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to quote one of the FtH guys:<br />
<br />
The first bosses in BT were 2 easy...and the last 2 bosses were to easy to be in that place. The whole instance is more casual than anything before.<br />
<br />
Translated freely on german base ;p<br />
<br />
Well anyway. You can see it everywhere: Daily quests, consumable change, encounter tuning, attunement changes and gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
Untill now, raiding has been hardcore - no matter who you gonna ask, they will tell you that. It has been a pain in the ass, yes, but you felt probably more accomplished than you will feel anywhere in the future.<br />
<br />
We will see.</div></div><hr />

The way I see it is I put in hours upon hours of heroic runs to key myself for SSC and The Eye, why should a casual gamers playing experience be any different from mine becuase they dont have the time to run endgame. Well I hate to break it to those casual gamers my guild as well as most out there sure as hell wouldnt ever allow an undergeared player in SSC, shit we dont let guildies alts into Kara if they have even 1 green. As for the thing about ppl being worried about alts getting attunded and thats one of the reasons for this new loot, plz no guild in its right mind is going to utlize this loot to attune a guild alt, they are going to sell it. <br />
<br />
Really the only thing this new SSC loot is doing is putting a few more dollars in Blizzards pockets .... The new SSC loot will ensure thousands of accounts that would be otherwise inactive because the gamer doesnt have time to play will now be active cause hey who wouldnt want there all green lvl 70 to run SSC.</div></div><hr />

People selling it might become problem tho in the later stages but no different to guilds selling MC,bwl etc items to the more casual players.</div></div><hr />

You miss the point completely. The scroll would never end up in a casual players hands because they would have no need to go to the instance at all. Backflagging simply makes it easier for you to get new guild recruits into the instance without requiring them to be attuned. You could argue that its laziness on there part but it makes recruitment so much easier.<br />
Doesn't mean they are going to be handed free loot does it.<br />
<br />
And you may wish to give it to Alts in the future when interest in the instance drops and you fail to get enough players show up for runs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Schnobie1</div><div class="date">2007-05-21, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand and accept that arguement Relm and it does make perfect sense that &quot;in the future when interest in the instance drops&quot; however I still see this new SSC loot as an insult towards players who actually go out of their way and take the time to complete complicated quest chains.</div></div><hr />
