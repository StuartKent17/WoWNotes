<br />
Yes. Carbots does a weekly animated short for starcraft, and also did the 'official' launch party trailer for Heart of the Swarm, which is probably why Blizz picked them for this.</div></div><hr />

each side represents a blizzard franchise... Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo... look at a close up of the title and you can see each is different</div></div><hr />

<br />
'League of Legends' vs 'Heroes of the Storm'. I'd say both sound sufficiently nerdy and can't really see a difference in vibe. Blizzard All-Stars makes me think of Warcraft Baseball or something.<br />

Well, seeing as it all began with custom made maps made in Warcraft 3, it's only fitting and honestly fair, that Blizzard now does the same.<br />

<br />
Well, it gives off a sports vibe. League.. Allstars... it's all about the esport presentation. While, Heroes of the Storm, make sit sound too RPGish, and less about competitive team play.<br />
<br />
While, DOTA is just short for Defensive of the Ancients. You had to play WC3:TFT at it's prime to really understand the name. Now it's just DOTA, because quite frankly, that's exact problem with HOTS, people are just going to call it HOTS. Too close to the red-headed step child, HON, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there's already a lot of info about the gameplay, the champions (i want more!!!) and how is going to work, is not like DOTA or LoL, the jungle will be really different cause when you defeat a big mob of the jungle it will replace one of your minions in the lines, the Towers will be more like DOTA (not that OP) and they will also have a quantity of ammo, so if you leave a tower alone, it will be easily destroyed, but the minions will be more LoL like cause you won't be able to deny minion kills, etc...</div></div><hr />

Guinsoo and later Icefrog, both BEGGED. BEGGED, Blizzard to give official support of the game. They laughed! Laughed, at Guinsoo. I remember later when Gunisoo quit having anything to do with DOTA, and started on the &quot;client&quot; he called it, which would later be called, you guessed it, League of Legends. I was in the chat room, when everyone was saying &quot;goodbyes&quot; to him even though he officially quit off the screen.<br />

Meh, the free to play model sucks. It didn't work well with HoN and it doesn't work well with Dota, the reason being that there's no penalty to breaking the rules or being an overall douchebag. Oh no, they banned his account, he already has 5 other accounts ready to go since they don't cost anything...<br />
<br />
But it will most likely be a free to play with an in-game store where you can buy cosmetic stuff, just like the other ones. <br />

I really have no confidence in Blizzards ability to be successful in the MOBA area however, but it would be nice if they proved me wrong.</div></div><hr />

LoL might have a huge playerbase but it also has a really awesome reputation of a terribly toxic community. HoN has the same problem, and it's a problem that will be ever more noticeable in Dota as time goes along.<br />

Imagine the cheesy powermetal theme of everything.

Yep agreed. I'll be surprised if it's not linked to BN. It has to be. It's their central hub for all their games and the game will be launched from the BN launcher etc. And this will hopefully be enough of a deterrent to prevent people abusing the game.</div></div><hr />

I was referring to Dota 2 with Dota, and as I said in the post it's a problem that will become more and more noticeable. Dota 2 is still really young and came out of its beta quite recently, give it a year and we will probably see the same shit I experienced in HoN.</div></div><hr />

DOTA on Wc3:TFT was a notoriously toxic community. While they did try to clean it up. It was just awful sometimes. Not only that, if you were trying to learn. You would get banned for sucking.<br />
<br />
It's only a matter of time until the toxic shit leaks into DOTA. I had a grand time last night with a dude, that insisted on calling everyone over the mic, &quot;Fat Nigger vaginas.&quot; Spamming chat, and feeding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's sadly the nature of the game. Be it HoN, Dota 1, Dota 2, LoL, or any other MOBA which is even remotely similar, it will bring out the worst in some people. A lot of it probably has to do with how greatly a team mates play can even benefit the opposing team if he/she plays badly, along with everyone being completely anonymous and most likely never ending up playing with or against each other again. Add free to play on top of that and you have created some of the best possible circumstances for a toxic community.<br />
<br />
The whole &quot;screw you guys, you took my mid now I'm going to feed like no tomorrow!&quot; wasn't uncommon at all in public games in HoN, I can imagine it happens in LoL too and it will most certainly happen to Dota 2. People are incredibly selfish and hateful when they can get away with it.</div></div><hr />

WoW expansion will be biggest announcement, but i think there will be a gameplay video of heroes of the storm, maybe a release date / beta.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxilian</div><div class="date">2013-10-17, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like how certain people blame the GAME ( Dota 1 &amp; 2, HoN, LoL, Whatever ) for having a horrible playerbase. It's the nature of MOBA games and if you think Blizzards version of their MOBA game won't have the usual bunch of angry nerds and LFR attitude, you're silly.<br />
<br />
Actually is expected, but you know that HoN was pretty much destroyed by it, the question is... &quot;How bad will it be in HOTs?&quot; and &quot;Will it survive?&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RoKPaNda</div><div class="date">2013-10-17, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guinsoo and later Icefrog, both BEGGED. BEGGED, Blizzard to give official support of the game. They laughed! Laughed, at Guinsoo. I remember later when Gunisoo quit having anything to do with DOTA, and started on the &quot;client&quot; he called it, which would later be called, you guessed it, League of Legends. I was in the chat room, when everyone was saying &quot;goodbyes&quot; to him even though he officially quit off the screen.<br />
<br />
Now Blizzard wants part of the pie. Sorry, but League is the WoW of MOBAs. While, DOTA is a good game, it just won't drag as many people around like League has and will. Egg in the eye, Blizzard. Egg in the eye.<br />
<br />
They want part of the pie, and they're going to get part of the pie. They're not going to become the next LoL, and they're not likely to become the next Dota 2 either, but they'll have some success. The funny thing is, Valve is actually pumping a significant amount of money into Dota 2, and Dota 2 is doing quite well. The reason why WoW is the WoW of MMOs isn't because WoW is perfect it's because for the longest time WoW had no competition. League already has good competition from Dota, and I think if Valve keeps pumping money into Dota and generating hype, eventually it might surpass League in some regions. Valve was late to the party, and for the longest time the game wasn't very accessible, but it's steadily gaining ground. If Blizzard takes a page from Riot and Valve's books and pumps cash into the game, generates significant hype, etc they can realistically steal a decent chunk of the playerbase. Nothing crippling, nothing that makes them top dog, etc. And that's good enough for them. <br />
<br />
When Blizzard didn't support Dota, it's not like Blizzard said no to something that was as significant as League. Dota while being the most popular War3 custom map by far, wasn't a very large community. Compared to other fan made maps? Absolutely. In the grand scheme of things? Not so much. And this was before indie games really took off, this was before F2P with microtransactions was a thing, the market was just different. eSports was in it's infancy. Passing on supporting League wasn't a bad decision because nobody at the time could have predicted that League and Mobas in general would for some reason take off the way they did. I get why they're great to play with friends, but to this day I still have no idea how so many people can enjoy watching them. <br />
<br />
TLDR: I have no interest in this moba or any moba, but I think it will do well enough. It'll probably pay for itself and Blizzard will break even on dev costs through microtransactions just based on the Blizzard name alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually is expected, but you know that HoN was pretty much destroyed by it, the question is... &quot;How bad will it be in HOTs?&quot; and &quot;Will it survive?&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm actually kind of surprised that LoL is surviving it, even after the supposed measures to reduce community toxicity, it's horrible. That's probably the #1 reason why I couldn't stay interested in playing LoL. The game itself was fun, with friends it's fun, but the community is just ... gahhhhhh.</div></div><hr />

There's nothing wrong with blaming the game, they clearly can't take proper course of action to get rid of them. I would seriously pay to get an account that would allow me to play against other people who payed for their account, thus only playing with/against people who take the game at least a little bit seriously. My friends who also play Dota 2 would gladly do the same thing.<br />
<br />
It's possible to filter out the childish mentality of such people if they actually have something to lose.</div></div><hr />

Not really. I don't know if you have ever played HoN, but toxic players are all over the MMR. It's worse the lower you go, but even on the higher ratings it's common to run into them. Even if you play as a whole team of 5, the opposing side might still be filled with them, granted the risk is a lot lower but the likelihood is still there.<br />

I've already run into some of it when queuing alone in Dota 2, not even close to as bad as in HoN but it's there, bubbling on the surface.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying Dota 2's playerbase is bad now, for the most part the people are really friendly and nice (which is the primary reason I prefer it over HoN at the moment). Just saying it will probably not stay like that for long, HoN was the same on its release and got worse by the years, especially notable once it went free to play.</div></div><hr />

Dota 2 not toxic? You must be playing a different game. They all have a toxic community. It just comes with the genre. It will be funny to see players who have never played Lol or Dota 2. You think LFR is bad? Hahaha the games are far worse. But play with a group of friends and its completely different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
granted there will be an intial surge im sure, people checking it out being curious and all, but unless the gameplay is truly innovative and groundbreaking i dont see it becoming quite as popular as LoL and Dota2 are.<br />
<br />
mobas work well as an esport and if they are smart theyll put a lot of time developing the interface to support spectator mode and stuff but unless theyre willing to dish out massive rewards from tournaments then i dont see a lot of the pros switching either. the pay outs for the winners of the season splits and world championships are quite impressive in LoL.<br />
<br />
just my opinion however<br />

yea moba's and fps games are generally quite terrible as far as the community goes and not to sound like a debbie downer but i dont expect this games community to be any better. youre going to get some people who are familiar with mobas trashing and bashing a bunch of the people who are fans of blizzard games but have never played a moba before.</div></div><hr />

In my experience, any game that revolves around people &quot;killing&quot; other people is over the top toxic. &quot;Competition&quot; brings out the worst in people, not to mention when said &quot;competition&quot; is (relatively) anonymous.</div></div><hr />

An your gullible to believe that any one can create a trademark under Blizzard's name &amp; get away with it. If anything Blizzard pulled it changed the name or registered it in Swaziland.<br />
<br />
If they pulled it and registered is elsewhere, people would find it....just like they find all the other &quot;trademarks&quot;. Thanks for playing.</div></div><hr />

Its still a very cheap video for BLizzard to announchea new name on their title.

It's not the first time Blizzard reaches out to the community and sponsors and or supports someone's work. Remember the Lore on the forums? He used to be working for Tankspot now he's with Blizzard. Extreme example sure but I think it has merit.</div></div><hr />

If Tencent has no effect in Activision BLizzard.... Then why is BLizzard releasing such a junk video when re-branding of new franchise name for the company? And again... its junk compared to what players are used to from BLizzard.<br />

Interesting that you know everything of what Tencent is doing... when you didn't even know 30 mins ago they were part of the investor group.<br />
<br />
In other words... you have no idea. The deal between Tencent and Kotick is between those two. Lets not forget that Kotick is Activision ... not Blizzard. And Blizzard as a developer company has now absolutely ZERO to say about the future of the company. They don't even have a member on the board.</div></div><hr />

i can make up lies to. and the reason i didnt know, is because they didnt buy much, they bought a small portion of the company, i dont have to KNOW what they are up to they literally CANT do what you are suggesting they dont have the majority.<br />

and part of the contract between blizzard and activision is that they get to continue doing things on their own without outside interference, this has been part of the deal since the beginning and unless someone new buys back the stocks nothing changes</div></div><hr />

Blizzard never did any deal with Activision. Vivendi did. Vivendi is now gone... and the former Activision group is now in control of the entire company. <br />
<br />
Everyone knows how Activision as a publisher has been treating their developer companies for the past years. Thats not going to change. Legally - Blizzard as a company has no say in their own future. Thats just a fact.</div></div><hr />

You obviously know very little about appealing to fans. Carbot has a large series of videos with millions of views. This is not a demonstration of the artstyle at all of the game, this Blizzard having fun with an announcement. Not every game needs to be announced with million dollar cgi master pieces. Heroes of the Storm has always been designed a lower profile game much like Hearthstone (that game did not have a huge cgi launch trailer, it had a video made up of stills). You are grasping at straws now to try to support an argument that others have already punched numerous holes in.</div></div><hr />

They would probably have to make it F2P if they want any hope of challenging Valve and Riot Games. That was one of the reasons why SC2 shrunk as an e-sport, due to needing to pay for it and attach it to a battle.net account.<br />

its a game where characters from different universe are shoved together and forced to smack each other. <br />

if you dont go into it with a silly comic booky cartoony feel to its premise you arent really doing it right.<br />

And LoL features characters like Tristana and Lulu and Veigar and Fizz and Amumu... obviously, the only reason they would include champions like these is to try to rope in the seven-year-olds, right?<br />

<br />
I agree. Blizzard needs to do something different to appeal to non blizzard fans who already have a favorite game like dota or league. I really think the answer is having multiple types of game modes. Moba, arena, tower wars and frenzy would be the best thing ever.</div></div><hr />

I was in the chat room, when everyone was saying &quot;goodbyes&quot; to him even though he officially quit off the screen.<br />
<br />
Yes this is 100% credible right here. You totally didn't make this up.<br />
<br />

Now Blizzard wants part of the pie. Sorry, but League is the WoW of MOBAs. While, DOTA is a good game, it just won't drag as many people around like League has and will. Egg in the eye, Blizzard. Egg in the eye.<br />
<br />
You're telling me that a for-profit company is trying to make more money? What? BLASPHEMY! While LoL may have more players Dota 2 is doing quite fine for itself with a solid 6.5 million active players (not including people who are still playing WC3 DotA). It's a more solid title with better production quality, more depth and more diversity within the gameplay. It's proven its longevity while LoL is more of a fad that is poorly balanced and the company (Riot) treats a good portion of its players like shit and handles the game disgustingly badly. Best of all it's made by a respected company (Valve) that has long seen the value in community made content. Valve also has a little something called Steam which has over 50 million active users, more so than LoL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they dont have a choice, really, if they wanna atlast try to compete. dota is completely free to play, LoL somewhat too, HotS cant come up with just a copy of LoL system, as that wouldnt attract LoL players at all, who already invested in their game, nor would it attract dota players tbh. And lets be honest, both dota and LoL are absolutely massive, I dont know exact LoL numbers other than the fact, that its played by much more people than dota, while dota2 has about 7million players and 500k+ concurrent players are the norm, weekends are even bigger (And the fact, that dota2 isnt even launched in china yet). Thats more than WoW had in years (and what whole bnet barely touches in weekend peak), thats how big those two games are and thats what Blizzard wants to compete with. <br />
<br />
This isnt vacated RTS playground, where SC2 had all the room it needed to make a lasting, popular esport (and still failed tbh.) This would be like making an MMORPG that can compete with not one, but TWO WoWs, good luck with that. Its a blizzard game, so obviously, its gonna be solid game and have some foolowing regardless, but its not gonna be a real competition to those two, unless some miracle happens.</div></div><hr />

To actually reply. Sorry, your behind the 8 ball, and had no actual clue what went down. Yeah, you can claim I don't have a clue, but I was there. Guinsoo had a meeting with Blizzard, once in person and once over the phone, over getting official Blizzard support. At least that's what Pendragon said, I mean FFS. Did they, actually, laugh. Probably not. Though it was just simply a joke to Blizzard, easily dismissed.<br />
<br />
It seems you are a bit of a Valve fanboy. I like DOTA2, I played it everyday. Though, it's not as fluid, it's clunky, blocky, and quite frankly dull. LoL, offers a more fluid game and better color scheme. Which makes LOL more appealing. I will agree, that DOTA2 has more depth and diversity as far as Champion customization. That doesn't make it better a game. That makes it a more complicated game. Combined with the FPS issues, delay issues, and overall shitty quality of the game, it makes for unnecessary complication.<br />
<br />
I wasn't wrong with my assessment of WoW = LOL, in terms; when it launched, how it has broken open the market, the color scheme and fluidity of the play.<br />
<br />
With your current attitude it's no wonder you got banned, from both MMO Champ and LOL. Butthurt much?</div></div><hr />

Of course, but I didn't start it. You make an account just to discredit someone, with no credence of your own. Is irony at it's finest. He bashes LoL and raises Valve on a pedestal. Fanboy. If he didn't want to be a fanboy, shouldn't act like one.<br />
<br />
I gave my experience with early stages of DOTA:TFT. Simply said, that the game, DOTA2, won't garnish as much of a following as LoL. Mainly because LoL is the market. I also praised the game in the same breath, and gave no critique. LoL is like WoW in comparison, already gave my reasons and I stand by it.<br />

<br />
Anyway, while Heroes of the Storm would have been a pretty janky name for the next expansion, I figured it would have made a decent title for Blizzard's new ARTS or whatever it's going to wind up being. I wonder if they're going to keep the DOTA style stuff down to the letter, give it a few twists here and there like Smite and Dawngate, or try to mix things up entirely and craft something that doesn't really fig snugly into most of the usual standards.</div></div><hr />
