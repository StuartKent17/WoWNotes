Blue Posts<br />
Mythic Item Level<br />
I've seen most groups ask for people at 305 to 315ish that's just my experience though and I can see people asking for higher. <br />
<br />
Honestly they're very doable under 300 as long as you can follow mechanics and figure out some strats with your group.<br />
<br />
If I was doing a World Tour with all pugs, I would aim to have the group be all 320.<br />
I would ask for something similar if we were doing a World Tour. Some of the dungeons are a bit harder than the others and can be pretty challenging at lower ilvls but for the most part they're pretty doable and similar to the heroic counterparts in difficulty.

If they want to reveal Diablo 4 (I don't imagine what else, they released hype video right before they sold new tickets for Blizzcon) it would be pretty stupid to annouce it on Gamescom and leave Blizzcon empty, don't you think?<br />

We have 45 minute long panel on Gamescom about WoW (+ however long is WoW section on opening ceremony). It may be about BfA launch, sure, but so far they always used Gamescom/Blizzcon to talk about upcoming content.</div></div><hr />

I started doing them with a group of guildies at 290-300, but i still understand the requirements.<br />
People are generally quite bad, and if i can get a way with asking for a high itemlevel, i will do it for sure so their gear can carry them a bit if they suck.</div></div><hr />

I do like PL. Got one toon decked in like 344 and a second on the 320ish climb. Looking forward to raids with PL too. Questing was a little much but it was over really quick. So trade off? For sure. You loving BFA?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually he's right. I started doing Mythics, as a DPS, at ilvl 304. I wasn't even able to queue for Heroics. At 329 currently and it's not hard finding groups. There's just lots of competition when it comes to DPS especially if you have rogues queuing up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
he might be right though<br />
<br />
he simply doesnt see them since if people tick 320 or 325 in req box he simply doesnt see those groups. <br />
<br />
im personally gonna be putting 335 in that box for next weeks clears making people below it now seeing it,<br />

i know people who run 3 alts through all mythic 0<br />
<br />
Yes, because 3 Mythic is all I was able to get in after hours of finishing up the requirements of 120, making sure I went through and geared up in as many Heroics I could, completing as many WQs as I could, and finishing up completing all the major Quests in the zones for the Seige dungeon. <br />
All within the first 3-4 days of launch.<br />
Its not called lazy, its called having a real life and work.<br />
Get out of here with your elitist-jerk attitude</div></div><hr />

I remember this also happening in Legion too. Moral is pretty much if you're not already half Mythic-geared already, your gonna have a bad time getting accepted as a dps.<br />
<br />
How about you find yourself a guild and/or friends. It's completely normal people don't want to waste time while doing their chores. Minimum ilvl is one way to filter the shitters. Maybe not 100% accurate, but we don't have better tools.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, because getting in a group as a &lt;335 dps is impossible, but getting a tank and healer as a &lt;335 dps will totally work!<br />

Since loremaster is now &quot;do the chapter story quests&quot; now and not &quot;ocmplete X quests in a zone&quot; they should really differentate the story quests from normal ones, so if someone wants to avoid the side quests they know which ones they are.<br />
Story quests are the ones you get following the very first quest you get when you go to a zone. If you don't pick up new ones by yourself, so just get the new one that follows on the one you just did, you will only do the chapter story. It's not that hard. If you start running around and clicking exclamation marks that no one asked you to get, you'll be doing side quests.</div></div><hr />

Gamescom schedule, but is it in Gamescom time or my current time, would be cool to mention this. I'm going to assume it's Gamescom time so opening ceremony is at 11:30 CET or whatever.</div></div><hr />

Ugh, that hurts. I was hoping tomorrow panel is about new content, but it's &quot;Island Expeditions showcase&quot;. Let's hope they at least say two words about next patch on opening ceremony, since Azshara Warbringer is scheduled for friday anyway.</div></div><hr />

Whole Gamescom situation is weird, I'm not sure if Blizzard plans to live stream it at all as times just don't match. Opening Ceremony is at 11:30 CEST yet on their Gamescom site the timer counts down to 17:00 CEST. Also on Mmo-champion's Blue Post there is info that Gamescom home experience has pre-recorded stuff in it so it could be a recap.<br />
<br />
Also it seems Ion isn't attending Gamescom if he is to do a Q&amp;A on Thursday from Blizzard at Irvine. However he is going to Pax so they could reveal info there instead.</div></div><hr />

Just want to ask.<br />
<br />
Will Twitch have a stream for it and will Blizzard have their stuff up on theirs? Never really watched this other than for the Legion reveal. But I really want to see the Warbringers short. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
