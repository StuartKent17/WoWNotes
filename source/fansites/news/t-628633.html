The reward for completing the hard modes are not going to be just achievement points, titles, or mounts, but improved, additional item rewards.<br />
<br />
I think it's safe to say that Ulduar will be a bit more difficult overall than Naxxramas, even without the hard modes. We're still going to tune the zone for accessibility(*), but a raid group that's done Naxxramas, Malygos, and Sartharion and obtained the gear from those encounters should be well prepared for Ulduar. Not only is the raid's gear better, but players should now have some raiding experience under their belts. We also have a much more accurate picture of what guilds are capable of from a healing, damage, and tanking perspective then when WotLK first went live. If Naxxramas was the introduction to raiding 101 class for players who have never raided before, think of Ulduar as the second year class.<br />
<br />
* There will be one optional encounter that is only tuned as a &quot;hard mode&quot; encounter.<br />
<br />
I don't think you have to worry about spoilers from Achievements, to be honest. Seeing achievement text before you fight a boss is like seeing a single piece of a large jigsaw puzzle. Sure, it's something, but it's nothing really without seeing the context of the encounter as a whole. I also expect achievements to be something tested late in the PTR process. Implementing them is one of the last parts of the development pipeline. <br />

<br />
Class vs. damage in Arenas<br />
In the interest of encouraging discussion, I am going to pose a question below.<br />
<br />
Caveats: Please don't derail this thread. It it liable to get long. Also please do not take my comments out of context or attempt to read too much between the lines. I hate having to communicate like a politician. &amp;#58;(<br />
<br />
The same classes keep coming up in Arena discussions: rogues, mages, death knights and paladins. In a world with low resilience, it is perhaps unsurprising that classes that combine burst damage with so many tools for avoiding damage would be powerful.<br />
<br />
Let's set aside the discussion of these classes for a moment (and to be fair, it is probably specs, not classes). My question is this: In an Arena match in which none of those 4 are participating, do you feel that damage is too high *given* that it will only come down once players acquire more resilience?<br />
<br />
If you can't tell, I am trying to get the community to explore whether it is those classes or damage in general that is causing so much consternation. (Original thread (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14132914177&amp;sid=1))<br />

Burst damage vs. Healers efficiency in Arenas<br />
We understand that many players feel burst damage is too high right now. We hear you. But when all is said and done, there still needs to be a place for damage dealers. Killing a healer, even in the absence of crowd control, silences or whatever, still needs to be a viable tactic at the end of the day. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14133413664-ghostcrawler-this-is-what-worries-me.html))<br />
<br />
PvE Gear in PvP<br />
Ideally, PvE gear should be what you use until you have PvP gear. The same should be true of using PvP gear to do a raid. Weapons are a little bit of an exception, since traditionally their damage has been high and resilience low. That may be worth changing though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14135703817-gc-how-do-you-feel-about-pve-gear-in-arena.html))<br />
<br />
Gear Upgrade - Slightly different stats on different tiers<br />
Unless the piece's name is orange, gear should almost always be a choice. Even if you are jumping up a tier you may be dropping some stats in order to increase others.<br />
<br />
Gearing up is one of the most interesting parts of the game. Deciding whether you want X or Y is supposed to be a tough decision. We make no guarantee that everything that drops is an upgrade for you, even set pieces.<br />
<br />
Building the most optimal set of gear for your particular spec is also one of the things that lets more expert players demonstrate mastery of the game. If the set pieces were always better, that wouldn't happen. In fact one of the reasons we made sets smaller (not 8 pieces or whatever) is so players could still undertake the challenge of completing them without also getting in a position where they were very reluctant to upgrade again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14132373550-haste-and-me.html))<br />
<br />
Buffing vs. Nerfing<br />
We often owe it to the community to take the easy way out, because that means faster changes and fewer bugs. But it isn't always the right decision. Elemental dps is low, and instead of nerfing everyone else we buffed Elemental, because that was a lot easier to do. We have a lot we want to do with the game. We are nearly always going to opt for easy solutions unless the outcome is a lot worse.<br />
<br />
I'm not quite sure what your point about tanking is. We're pretty happy with the state of tanking. It still takes a reasonably clever person with good gear to MT a raid, but there are four classes who can do it now. I don't think the threat game was a particularly fun part of PvE for many players, but I also don't think that is why the encounters are easy right now. They are easy because the damage and health done by the mobs is low, and because none of the encounters require that much raid coordination (and the trickier ones are encounters players saw before in the 40-player days and were allowed to practice on during beta). Ulduar is all new content and it will be a lot more challenging. I am thinking of one fight in particular that will probably take some time to conquer.<br />
<br />
Tanking is still stressful until stuff is completely on farm, not because the tank is furiously mashing Heroic Strike to stay above the lock on threat, but because the tank needs to position the boss and know when to use their cooldowns. Healing will always be stressful, and I don't actually believe the way to make healing more fun is to make healers overpowered. I think it has more to do with giving them cool tools and then beefing up the UI to give them the information they need. Penance is a pretty cool tool. Beacon of Light makes you feel clever when you use it in the right situations. Swiftmend is a lot of fun. I like Riptide.

<br />
AE Damage and AE Healing<br />
The four classes do have ways of dealing with AE damage to the raid. You have instant spells, hots, fast casts and AE heals. We have tried not to make any encounters that throw out so much damage that you can't function without a heal that hits 5 targets at once. As I said, those events are supposed to be about triage and coordination, not mashing the uber &quot;fix this&quot; button.<br />
<br />
We throw AE damage at groups to challenge the healers, and to a lesser extent, the raid. Hitting one button 2 to 3 times in a row is not challenging. That's not how we want you to solve the problem of Saph's aura or Malygos' Vortex. It is in fact so not challenging that it starts to look pretty attractive any time more than one or two people are taking damage at once, such as most trash pulls and many boss fights. Sure maybe it's not the most efficient or even smartest way to heal, but it's sooo easy.....<br />
<br />
We throw AE damage at the raid because players have proven they can pretty much handle any situation where only a few tanks are taking tons of damage (though we still have some fights like that). We feel like we need diversity in order to offer as many encounters as we do. Naxx and Ulduar have a lot of bosses.<br />
<br />
If we find that we are throwing too much AE damage at the raid with the nerfs to CoH and WG, we'll adjust those encounters. I kind of doubt that will be the case since many groups have those fights on farm even without priests or druids, but because a lot of players are concerned about it, we will absolutely pay close attention to those situations. If we find that CH trivializes AE damage, or if cutting-edge guilds start stacking Resto shamans to the exclusion of other healers, we will make adjustments as well. Again, we don't think that is likely or we would have already done something. But we won't close the door on the possibility of that happening either, because clearly it is a concern of the community.<br />
<br />
I have stated the above paragraph many different ways in many different threads over the past couple of months, so please forgive me if I start trotting it out a little less frequently. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13908950575-worried-about-gcs-post-on-chain-heal.html))<br />
<br />
Healing and UI Mods<br />
Some players just like mods. Messing around with them and reconfiguring their UI is part of the game for them. That's cool and why we promote it.<br />
<br />
However, I also think there is a group of players (healers even) who would be content to use the default UI if they could make it work. Identifying areas where the default party and raid UI fall down can help us to improve it.<br />
<br />
For example, we are unlikely to ever fully support Clique-style one click healing. We just don't think it's necessary to play the game and it's more of a user preference -- perfect for a mod.<br />
<br />
However, I do find it annoying that our raid UI can show you buffs or debuffs but not both at the same time. This can be a real pain for say a priest or druid that has both hots and dispellable debuffs and long-term buffs to manage.<br />
<br />
A useful question to ask is: What would the default WoW UI need to do to convince you not to install a mod? (&quot;Nothing&quot; is a perfectly acceptable answer -- as I said, some people just like mods.)

Dual Wield vs Two-Hand<br />
The goal is to let death knights make a choice between DW or 2H dps. We realize there is a risk that DW will overtake 2H at some point, but that is not the goal. For most existing classes that promote DW, we allow DW to dominate.<br />
<br />
It's hard to tell if that is happening yet on DKs. Patchwerk is a short fight where blowing cooldowns reaps big benefits, and I tend to agree with the opinions that this guy won the lottery.<br />
<br />
We haven't decided if we are going to take steps yet to back off DW damage. I think the jury is still out on whether we are going to see a lot or most DKs go the DW route. If DW DKs are only going for the fastest possible weapons in order to maximize procs per unit time, then that is something we might address.<br />
<br />
I definitely wouldn't vendor your Colossal Skull-Clad Cleavers just yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13908727986-6352-patchwerk-dps-as-dw-dk-03239.html))<br />
<br />
Anti-Magic Shield/Zone<br />
We buffed AMS because we dropped the mitigation of Icebound Fortitude and Bone Shield by a pretty hefty margin.<br />
<br />
I believe we did adjust the AMS glyph, but I'm not in front of my desk at the moment.<br />
<br />
One idea that has been circulating is to have AMS and AMZ share a cooldown so that the DK can't just pop both in rapid succession. It's possible this might make AMZ pretty unattractive in PvE though, which is why we haven't pulled the trigger on that one yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13909410400-antimagic-shellzone.html))<br />
<br />
Summon Gargoyle<br />
My suspicion is the Gargoyle is OP at the moment. It may only be in situations where the DK needs a lot of burst on demand, but it definitely seems more popular than we suspected it would be. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13909388867-gc-quick-dk-questions.html))<br />
<br />
Heart Strike<br />
Heart Strike should be your go to ability in most cases. When you are at risk for breaking CC, you can use Blood Strike instead. But the intent is that Heart Strike will do more damage. It competes with Frost Strike and Scourge Strike in the other trees. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13909388867-gc-quick-dk-questions.html))<br />
<br />
Blood Spec<br />
For PvE, we've seen some pretty decent numbers come out of Blood. I think players just need more time to try out all the build combinations. For PvP the big hits of Scourge Strike, the mitigation of Bone Shield and AMZ and the extra damage from the Gargoyle and ghoul probably make Unholy overshadow the other trees. This should be better next patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13909388867-gc-quick-dk-questions.html))<br />

Explosive Shot countered by both anti-magic and anti-physical abilities<br />
I agree it should make up its mind whether it is a physical or magical effect. We'll look into it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14133093673-design-choice-or-bug.html))<br />
<br />
Exotic pets (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14133093176-exotic-pet-damage-and-ptr.html))<br />
I have said most of this before, but perhaps some of you are just joining us. <br />
<br />
Exotic pets should be a choice. We do not want every BM (or every hunter for that matter) feeling like they have to get an exotic pet to be competitive. We spent a lot of effort to get say gorillas, crabs and spiders up to snuff so we didn't want hunters to actually enter LK with fewer pet choices. Even a 51 BM hunter should feel like a crab (especially a crab) should be a useful pet.<br />
Exotic pets should be a choice, part ii. They should not be demonstrably below say cats and scorpids. That seems to be the case on live at the moment, so we adjusted it. Because of the somewhat convoluted way that pets scale, it's not always easy to predict what the average pet will look like on live -- it varies enormously depending on gear and buffs (more on this below).<br />
Our target is that the exotic pets are slightly better than normal pets. The key word is &quot;slightly.&quot; If you forego an exotic pet for whatever reason, you should not feel like you are gimping your team or group. Note that part of the value of the exotics is their unusual abilities, some of which can fill in missing debuff holes if you are lacking certain classes in your group.<br />
We offered the Spirit Beast as a challenge for hunters to try and tame. It would be a big mistake if we made this pet the best one in the game. For starters, it would no longer be rare. &amp;#58;(<br />
We disagree that the 4 extra pet talent points are useless. You can call them useless if you only care about your pet's dps and can max that out without those talent points. Not all pet talents were intended to buff dps. (More on this below too.) At the end of the day, the BM 51 is just one talent point. It shouldn't grant you a 10% dps increase. We like for the 51 point talents to be attractive but not mandatory.<br />
If you think that no hunter cares about the look of their pet, you are just wrong. Very optimized players might be willing to tame an untextured cube if it had the highest dps. However, a great many hunters (I would argue probably even the majority) rolled their class because they wanted to tame pets. Being able to tame exotic pets is very exciting for them. <br />

Mortal Strike debuff on Paladins?<br />
I can understand why paladins think they need utility besides just massive damage and the occasional stun.<br />
<br />
That said, the Mortal debuff is in a tricky position. If we hand it out to too many more classes then it feels like we should just put everyone in a healing debuff aura when they step into Arenas, because it will just always be on. I think it's probably a good thing that Arms doesn't corner the market on the debuff anymore, but I'm also not sure we want to keep handing it around to every dps spec.

Warlocks in PvE<br />
We're generally happy with locks for PvE too. I think the rotations are more interesting than they were in BC and it's nice to see Affliction up there with Destro. Demo is probably still too low, but see below.<br />
<br />
As I've suggested before, there are a few things we are looking at on the PvE side of locks:<br />
<br />
Get shards into a place that is more interesting and less of a hassle. We have two models we're considering. One is very cool, but a huge change to gameplay, which might mean it has to wait. The other is more of a quick fix that we'd do until we can implement the very cool model.<br />
Simplify Affliction's rotation a little bit. This might involve making dots last a more uniform duration (so you didn't feel that external mods were mandatory) or just reducing the number of spells you're expected to cast.<br />
Locks are still built a lot around damage over time, but a lot of fights just aren't lasting a long time. This might mean locks needs some more options for quick damage, or the problem might fix itself in Ulduar.<br />
We're a lot happier with demons in LK, but we still have some work to do. The Voidwalker, Succubus and maybe the short-term demons aren't quite there yet. Improving demons should also help kick Demonology up a notch.<br />
There are a couple of awkward places in the talent trees still.<br />
<br />
Note that I am only talking PvE here. Some of these changes will help PvP too, but some of the lock problems in PvP will require different solutions too. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14135703666-warlock-pve-feedback.html))</div></div><hr />

Now if only they would bring back someway from people dinging 80 and just heading to heroics I would be very happy.<br />
<br />
Also just to add, I think tanking has become what it should have always been. As a warrior, tanking has not become easier or more trivial, but definitely more fun. It still requires timing, positioning and coordination, it just has provided more tools for us to do this with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That way the more relaxed, not-so experienced, casual or whatever you want to those guilds can do the raiding content the standard way and get the standard rewards, and at the sime time guilds that are up for the task can clear it the more difficult way and get both extra and better gear, and achievements to show other players that they're better than average guilds.</div></div><hr />

Burst damage vs. Healers efficiency in Arenas<br />
We understand that many players feel burst damage is too high right now. We hear you. But when all is said and done, there still needs to be a place for damage dealers. Killing a healer, even in the absence of crowd control, silences or whatever, still needs to be a viable tactic at the end of the day. (Source)<br />
<br />
What a complete and utter bullshit statement.<br />
<br />
In the absence of crowd control, silences or 'whatever', any player should not be able to kill a healer. I even dare to go as far as saying that '1 on 1' anyone should not be able to kill a healer.<br />
<br />
Why ? Staying alive is our only form of defense! <br />
<br />
We gained virtually no new healing tools to assist us, let alone escape mechanisms or have ours updated like so many damage spells have been. We are not be able to kill you, certainly if you're a Death Knight. In my case, I lost Insect Swarm - I'm certainly not going to bother trying to take you out with my untalented Starfire or risk getting my Nature school locked via Wrath. So that leaves us with what, Moonfire ? <br />
<br />
Still, fine. Moot argument since I can agree with when I say 'People should not be able to kill a healer 1 on 1' that people find I should not be able to kill the guy too.<br />
<br />
But please Ghostcrawler, are you even being serious ? <br />

I think you are misunderstanding slightly.<br />
<br />
Blizz's idea is that if in arena it came down to any 2 players facing off at the end with the rest of the team dead, then the outcome should be determined more by skill than by class matchup. Currently, if it comes down to dps vs. healer then the dps will pretty much stomp all over the healer. However, some of this is because people are using PvE gear - which emphasises output over survivability. This may change slightly when everyone is in full iLevel213 PvP gear - survivability will go up and damage output will go down (since resilience gobbles a larger proportion of output stats than it did in BC). Whether this will completely balance the current &quot;Burst&quot; situation is unknown - it likely wont, but it may give clothies a few more seconds to hit an emergency button or two rather than being autogibbed if their trink is on cooldown.<br />
<br />
Compare this with Season 4, where druids (and to a lesser extent pallys and priests) would tend to merrily laugh at dps. Unless they got lucky with crowdcontrol or interrupts, the dpser was pretty much going down (not always, mind you, but a large proportion of the time - you don't need to drag out anecdotes about how you pwned some healer). For specs that lacked those tools, well, they were completely shut out.<br />
<br />
Blizz is looking for a medium ground between the two - they want to make it clear that it should be possible for a dpser to kill a healer without having to rely on a lucky interrupt or cc. Shutting down casters is still part of the game, but you shouldn't waste 5mins of carefully wearing down a healer because you mistimed one skill. The key word here is &quot;possible&quot; - as I understand it, they also want to make it possible that the healer can outlast the dpser too.<br />
<br />
While class selection should be an important decision, it shouldn't be to the point of &quot;Oh crap, I'm fighting a &lt;insertclasshere&gt;. I might as well give up now&quot;. It looks like they overshot the mark currently, but hopefully they can push it back without completely rescaling everything.</div></div><hr />

I also see how frustrating it is to guilds like the much hyped Ensidia, who feel that even casual gamers can gain the same rewards if they push at the same instance hard enough. Give the Uber-Guilds the Uber-Challenge with Uber-Loot, perhaps the whole &quot;it's too easy QQ&quot; might die down then. <br />
<br />
PvP vs PvE, I honestly think, and this might be a too massive of an overhaul to be feesable but there should be separate abilities/stats/gear kept purposefully (and perhaps forcefully) for the relevant play-focus. I mean aside from resilience, more like, seperate Talent Trees (entirely reformatted to give accessability to spells/abilities that are more PvP or PvE focused) Similar to this Dual Spec idea, PvE spec vs PvP spec, but you can only access whichever it is you want when you are in the relevant area/zone, so as soon as you go into a BG/Arena game, you get your PvP spec etc, PvE jumps in when you zone into an instance for example. Keeping them a little more separate. When the discussion of &quot;burst damage&quot; comes up, I instantly think, &quot;What's wrong with burst damage in a PvE setting? Surely you want a big ol' nuke fest?&quot; But of course this is then considered over-powered in a PvP setting where some fights between players last only moments (thinking of battlegrounds here where rating/gear isn't similarly matched as per Arenas) If you had a method of separating the two ways of playing, then they wouldn't have such a massive impact on the other. Such as the Warlock changes mentioned above, &quot;This works for PvE, PvP we'll have to have a think about a little bit more...&quot; The designers have to play a balancing act, gently tweaking here and there so as not to entirely upset the class (or other classes) and yet, as will happen, something is changed that does make it unbalanced somewhere else. Just a thought here :)<br />
<br />
AE Healing: If people communicate more in guilds, people listen and work together rather than overhealing etc, there would be less panic about this CoH/WG CD. I personally find it more effective to slap a rejuv on 6 people (as an example) in time to head back to the MT and refresh LB, rather than spamming WG. It just seems like a daft spell. The only time I have personally felt a need to reach for the WG button was when I first encountered Telestra (Nexus) and she uses that Gravity Well spell that flings you all over the place dealing AE damage at the same time, I punched that button...but with later encounters, even on HC I don't see the need for it. I loved WG in MGT, in the Vexallus encounter with all those damned mana worms it saved my hide, but then this is just an opinion and I don't expect it to be agreed with :D My general feelings towards AE heals is that Shamans take the lead and the rest of us top up and help but DONT override. Same for MT/Single target healing. This could also be a case of too many bad pugs and not enough co-ordination and too much emphasis placed on the stupid healing meters. For the records: I hate those meters and how they make people behave. This is also a reason (I believe) that people are worried/QQing about the CD to CoH and WG, they're worried that they will slip down the healing charts once their spammable has been taken away. <br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents, I wonder if there are others who do agree with me :D</div></div><hr />

I'm a lock, so when getting consistently hit by by druids in cat form for 6-9k, damage is a problem. Warriors, with whirlwind, kill my pet and hit me pretty hard. Can't fear them during that. You can fear them after that, but then they'll just interecept. Double my resilience and increase my bonus spell damage by 20%, and melee will pretty much continue to destoy my class. Increase soul link percents does nothing if pets are so easily killed and do little damage to speak of. I am speaking of your average everyday player. Not the elite players which are few and far between. <br />
<br />
I would bet if you increased resilience for my class and that of shamans by 150%, the four classes you said to ignore in the conversation would more than likely still kill us more times than not. IMHO it's a combination of both class and burst.<br />
<br />
My interpretation of how PVE was set up was so raids wouldn't be class dependent ( X number of warriors, rogues mages, etc). The only way for a lock to be successful in arena (based on my limited understanding of and stomach for arena) is if they only partner with a particular class or two. I assume that holds true for shamans as well, but I could be wrong. <br />
<br />
I don't want to be OP'd (boring). I don't expect to get the best gear because I will do little to no arena, but I would like to be competitive, knowing maybe I could have done something different to survive instead of it being no chance just because of the class and burst damage.</div></div><hr />

The same classes keep coming up in Arena discussions: rogues, mages, death knights and paladins. In a world with low resilience, it is perhaps unsurprising that classes that combine burst damage with so many tools for avoiding damage would be powerful.<br />
<br />
Let's set aside the discussion of these classes for a moment (and to be fair, it is probably specs, not classes). My question is this: In an Arena match in which none of those 4 are participating, do you feel that damage is too high *given* that it will only come down once players acquire more resilience?<br />

<br />
The answer is still a resounding yes, the damage is too high. Hunters, feral druids, and warriors still output ridiculous damage. My jaw still hits the floor whenever I face a feral druid who can just shapeshift into bear vs me and my rogue partner, have nearly 40k HP, incredible mitigation, hots ticking, and still go around critting me and my partner for 6k+ damage. Warriors can just build rage on my partner and come to me, unleash everything they've got and kill me in one CC duration. And it came to no surprise when the first 2150 player in the world, a Hunter, said that it took no skill, and that all he does is hit BW and win.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, you have 7 classes doing out of control damage, 3 healers that can't keep up with anything, and 3 DPS that are effectively worthless when overshadowed by the other 7.<br />

<br />
Burst damage vs. Healers efficiency in Arenas<br />
We understand that many players feel burst damage is too high right now. We hear you. But when all is said and done, there still needs to be a place for damage dealers. Killing a healer, even in the absence of crowd control, silences or whatever, still needs to be a viable tactic at the end of the day. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14133413664-ghostcrawler-this-is-what-worries-me.html))<br />
<br />
If anyone needed any confirmation about how incredibly out of touch Blizzard's devs are with their own game, this statement takes the cake. Killing a healer should NEVER be a viable tactic at the end of the day if you find yourself without any CC, silences, or &quot;whatever.&quot; I'll even go so far to say that if 2 classes are only doing pure DPS, they together should not be able to outheal what a single healer is doing. It should always come down to skill, which is where the cat and mouse game of CC, snares, silences, peels, and environmental awareness comes into play. Arena would be a measure of absolutely nothing if it was only 2 sides running at each other with sticks trying to see who can hit one another the fastest. And sadly that's what it has turned into. Whichever side can just burst down the other fastest in the first 30 seconds wins. Grats Blizz, your triumph of PvP skill is ruined.<br />

Mortal Strike debuff on Paladins?<br />
I can understand why paladins think they need utility besides just massive damage and the occasional stun.<br />
<br />
That said, the Mortal debuff is in a tricky position. If we hand it out to too many more classes then it feels like we should just put everyone in a healing debuff aura when they step into Arenas, because it will just always be on. I think it's probably a good thing that Arms doesn't corner the market on the debuff anymore, but I'm also not sure we want to keep handing it around to every dps spec.

<br />
Where Blizzard screwed up was in having no decent high end PvP gear at launch. Now all the PvPers are crying because their blue crafted gear doesnt hold up to full epic Naxx 25 sets. It is the equivalent of someone in season 1 gear crying because they got burst down by a player in full sunwell gear. <br />
<br />
The natural progression into PvP gear is going to have huge affects on the Ret Palas and DKs. Teams without any healing debuff are incredibly sensitive to even slight increases in enemy survivability because the moment their burst no longer kills someone and healing kicks in they are screwed.<br />
<br />
That anyone is even mildly surprised to see burst damage teams doing well at the start of the first new arena season amazes me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A couple of things come to mind immediately. Sure resil will make a difference, but realistically how much? When people get 700-800 resil, how much incoming damage will that reduce, an extra 10% maybe? Thus still subject to an insane amount of burst dps.<br />
My guess in whatever arena match there is, I'd say especially 5v5 that 5 low resil high burst teams will dominate, no healers invited. Take people out before they take you out. The healer on the other side 1st in about 2 seconds, and that will be with 1k resil.<br />

That's the problem with classes that rely only in pure damage. Ppl will start to mitigate that soon or later (that's why those nerfs would be a problem in the future. Ppl forgot that HP, Resi, etc. would all go way up from lvl70 with lvl70 gear to lvl80 with lvl80 gear, and I'm not talking about iLvl 213 pvp gear only, but all good lvl 80 gear).</div></div><hr />

&quot;I don't think you have to worry about spoilers from Achievements, to be honest. Seeing achievement text before you fight a boss is like seeing a single piece of a large jigsaw puzzle.&quot;<br />

But I guess that the game is done when the challenge should come from something stated as &quot;optional&quot; (achievements). And only when they're actually a challenge at all (lol at heroics achievements and most of the raid ones for example, it's actually harder to fish all the coins or find all the dalaran books than most of the dungeon achievements).<br />
<br />
We shouldn't be doing &quot;engage the last boss of the game with 25% of the raid alive, all 24 adds up, half mana on players and only one healer, and naked, on 10-man version&quot; to finally do something worth of a challenge.</div></div><hr />

Utter bullshit. Currently many classes have way too much damage output that the real winners are those with CC and survival skills (Re: Not shaman, warlocks, hunters and priests). Who the hell cares what classes are FotM at certain seasons simply becuase of resilience? That's the fucking antithesis of what a competition is. What blizzard SHOULD be doing, and I ask that you all post this in my stead (long story), is balancing classes along each arena season. If damage becomes TOO low at higher resilience values, amp it up a little, but right now we have way to many fucktards in PvE gear running around gibbing everything just because they know how to pop Divine Shield, Bone Shield or some other rediculous ability that in no way impairs their output.

It isn't just the DPS that are in PvP gear, go look at the amount of resillience and PvE gear most of the people crying in that thread are wearing. Yeah an extra 400 resillience may not save them but add in another 3-4k health as well once they upgrade the gear and things start looking very different. Yes critting 6k on someone with 16k health is a lot, factor in resillience at close to the cap and that becomes a 4.5k crit on someone with 20k health, a very different proposition.<br />
<br />
Also it is worth mentioning that DK and Pala are both very popular classes. On most servers where I have looked both DK and Pala tend to be about twice as popular as almost any other class so naturally they will tend to be lots of people with that combo (and if you look at the numbers it is 7-8% of 2v2 teams that are Pala/DK with any spec, people who claim every single team is that makeup are exaggerating more than a little).</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, it's not as if they don't have the ability to make it any harder. they could have simply made the 'hard mode's as the initial encounter. but instead of that they gave people a choice. it's not as if anyone is going to force you to do the normal encounters, and this time they dont end in achievments but in better loot.<br />
<br />
also, it doesn't seem likely the 'hard mode' is going to be easy either. i mean, ppl are complaining sarth 3drake is lame with just a achievment and more drops from the same table but, i don't see anyone complaining it is 'too easy'<br />
<br />
so from the looks of it, the hard core users got their challenge, better loot, plus achievments to show off. i know some of you might still complain <br />
'we can just go normal encounter first and then try the hard modes so we still will have seen all content in one week'<br />
well, you could just try hard modes first and you'll progress slower right?<br />
'thats stupid, other guilds will be speeding through content and thats just a alternate mode, not content'<br />
that's somthing you people will have to understand. blizzard is trying to give us all a choice instead of making the game a one-track 'hard' or 'easy'. the casuals, or the 'unskilled retarded noobs', pay the same subscribtion as you all do and has the same right to enjoy content. of course the more skilled and dedicated deserve rewards, the better gear and achievments to prove it should do the job [surely it's not that you just simply don't like the fact that the lower level player base gets to raid the same dungeon as you?]<br />
<br />
as a mmorpg wow has a vast diverse playerbase the whole playerbase has to play by the same rules. due to this, it is impossible to fully satisfy 100% of the players. but what I like about wow is that it seems to be doing a decent job at this aspect.<br />
<br />
oh, and i'm actually saying this to all the people complaining about the easy content, not directly to you. I just quoted your comment because it was the first one I saw on this topic about the difficulty. no hard feelings, sorry that this post seems directed to you</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yasuhiko</div><div class="date">2009-01-04, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">... right now we have way to many fucktards in PvE gear running around getting gibbed then crying that burst damage is too strong.<br />
<br />
It isn't just the DPS that are in PvP gear, go look at the amount of resillience and PvE gear most of the people crying in that thread are wearing. Yeah an extra 400 resillience may not save them but add in another 3-4k health as well once they upgrade the gear and things start looking very different. Yes critting 6k on someone with 16k health is a lot, factor in resillience at close to the cap and that becomes a 4.5k crit on someone with 20k health, a very different proposition.<br />
<br />
Also it is worth mentioning that DK and Pala are both very popular classes. On most servers where I have looked both DK and Pala tend to be about twice as popular as almost any other class so naturally they will tend to be lots of people with that combo (and if you look at the numbers it is 7-8% of 2v2 teams that are Pala/DK with any spec, people who claim every single team is that makeup are exaggerating more than a little).<br />
<br />
<br />
Read pewpewarrows' analysis for more info, I agree with him there. Even in PvP gear, those attack will still be critting for large amounts, and those in PvP geqar only have a lower output to show for it. 6k Death Coil or 5k Death Coil, it's still painful, especially while you're cowering in Fear or Hammer of justice'd.</div></div><hr />

Funny. You compare the element of the game that's about 'Fairy's, Quests and killing Dragons' to a shooter ? I believe you mean 'Arena Players' should go play Halo 'or something' ?<br />
<br />
;)<br />
<br />
If you are referring to the achievement system being similar to what the developers of console games introduced: Achievements are not a bad thing and are perfect for adding that extra layer of 'difficulty' in the game that can cater to the 'infamous' 2% 'hardcore' player base.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
For starters, although the game itself might technically not be new - the expansion has 'soft reset' it so it created room to re tune the PvE raiding game. <br />
<br />
It seems to me Blizzard has learned a lot from Sunwell Plateau and is going in the direction of having content that might be easy at first, but will ramp up according to how hard you will make it. The Obsidian Sanctum in 10-man is a perfect example of how this could be achieved.<br />
<br />
I agree with Blizzard on this part - I'd gladly trade a horrible designed but required 'benchmark fight' such as Brutallus was to endgame raiding in the Burning Crusade for a more friendly, enjoyable PvE environment like we seemingly are having these days. Nothing is wrong with showing and making more people enjoy the content.<br />
<br />
Will Blizzard however succeed in making the 25-man game more challenging then it currently is ? My own vision on this is a bit grim at the moment, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt before spewing about this in obnoxious rants on various fora. Blizzard has proven itself to be excellent at designing PvE encounters and having them tuned accordingly - Kil'Jaeden being one of the best examples out there.<br />
<br />
Again, achievements can assist in this concept beautifully - if the bosses are designed around it.</div></div><hr />

Even verses lower level players I just die so fast, and most of the time I rely on stoneform to last as long as I do so how other races do it I have no idea.<br />
<br />
16,000 health and 2 power word shields worth 5000 health and pain suppression and I am still eating dirt, unable to get a decent spell off. Psychic scream? Too bad in WoW no one can hear you scream :P</div></div><hr />

I don't know what game you're playing. That or your main is one of the 4 classes facerolling their way to 2150 rating, and you just don't want to admit the problem.<br />
<br />
For months Beta players have been screaming at Blizzard that Resilience capped, max HP players were taking way too much damage in PvP and that healing is far sub-par.<br />
<br />
<br />
10 seconds? That isn't a burst. That is fairly serious sustained damage.</div></div><hr />

This might involve making dots last a more uniform duration (so you didn't feel that external mods were mandatory) or just reducing the number of spells you're expected to cast.<br />
<br />
Dear Blizzard<br />
<br />
Do this and i will shank your mailman.<br />
<br />
Atm I think feel that Affliction is in a really good place, the spec is putting out good damage and its great fun keeping up a full 7 spell rotation while repositioning during a boss fight and reacting to events. All i really want for Affliction is a touch more recognition that we're doing roughly 700% more work than the hunter who has a drinking bird set up to keep hitting the stead shot button, or failing that for the game to start playing a kick arse guitar riff whenever your full rotation is up and running to max efficiency.<br />
<br />
<br />
I love to see how druids, warlocks and warriors cry after they lost their spot on the top of the foodchain Grin<br />
<br />
So you registered because you were worried that not enough people on the internet thought you were a short sighted moron unable to identify underlying problems with the game play then? Well i admire your commitment to public service.</div></div><hr />

If you are spending 5 hrs 7 days a week in a raid instance, you are bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dear Immalek,<br />
<br />
please give hunters a rotation that is as &quot;hard&quot; as yours too so we don't have to spam steady shot. Seriously, just because you have a harder rotation doesn't mean you should do more damage, except if the other class you are competing against can do exactly the same thing.</div></div><hr />
