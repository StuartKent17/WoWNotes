<br />
Artifact Challenge Difficulty<br />
I get that these appearances are the new hotness and everyone is after them, which causes frustration. However, it's worth noting that the solo challenges to unlock the new appearances are intended to be just that; a challenge. We don't expect the majority of players to obtain them within the first cycle of the Mage Tower being constructed.<br />
<br />
Our aim for these challenges is for them to be comparable to that of the green fire questline for Warlocks in Mists of Pandaria. In that case, only a few Warlocks were able to defeat Kanrethad immediately, but more and more were able to overcome the challenge as the expansion progressed.<br />
<br />
As we progress through the course of Legion, your character will become stronger (through Artifact progression, gear upgrades, etc), which will naturally ease the difficulty of these challenges. Likewise, as more and more players complete these challenges, more community generated content will appear giving advice for those who are struggling.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, each artifact appearance has a different source. Some reflect dedication to a particularly gameplay style, such as raiding or PvP, others for reaching milestones like completing the 7.0 Order Hall line. In the case of these challenge appearances, they are meant to show that you've truly mastered the nuances of your spec.<br />

Broken Shore Building Uptime<br />
We will be monitoring region-wide contributions to all buildings pretty closely. If, down the line, we need to turn some knobs on our end it's something we should be able to do. Again, the topic is on our mind and we're watching to see how things play out.<br />
<br />
It's also worthwhile to note that &quot;casual&quot; players are the majority, so I don't foresee a world in the near future where the builds don't get completed at a decent pace.

Brewmasters in 7.2.5<br />
Alright, second round is on me as well, Brewmasters. Now that the weekend is over, we've had a chance to discuss all the great feedback you all have provided so far. Here's what we're thinking:<br />
<br />
(Note that the below changes likely won't make it into the first PTR build.)<br />
<br />
Stagger Cap<br />
As I said, the goal of this was cheese-prevention, not intended to impact normal gameplay. A Stagger cap of 100%*HP has a lot of value to us due to it functioning intuitively within the UI. We had hoped that the amount we need to buff HP/Armor would be reasonable in order to make that work, but looking at the numbers and your feedback, we don't think there's enough room there. Therefore, we're now leaning toward a 200%*HP cap, and that just won't be visible in the UI (but then, neither is the cap of Guardian Spirit and the like).<br />
<br />
Active Mitigation Duration Cap<br />
There has been a ton of useful feedback about this topic. Being able to carry over a ton of banked Active Mitigation (and Ironskin Brew absolutely is AM in context) from tank swaps and low damage phases is extremely powerful, and contributes to imbalance between tanks. But we're also sympathetic to how it adds an additional complication that you need to keep in your mental space. We think that just loosening the restriction up a bit so that the window you can safely press Ironskin Brew in is much wider will satisfy that, so we're going to try a cap of 3x Duration instead of 2x. And to clarify, calling this &quot;base duration&quot; was inaccurate; I meant the duration of a single cast of Ironskin Brew, including traits (so 3x Duration would be 24sec with 4/4 of that trait).<br />
<br />
Magic DR<br />
We've talked about having armor and potentially HP as tuning knobs to use. We also have the % of Stagger that applies to Magic to use. All of the changes we're discussing in this thread are for mechanical and playstyle reasons, and then tuning is a separate (but big and important) issue. Just to set expectations, Brewmasters with Mystic Vitality are currently seen as extremely strong against Magic damage, sometimes overpowered. Guardian Druids are also overpowered against Magic damage, and that will be adjusted as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks, and keep the feedback coming!<br />
<br />
Another point of feedback is that Brew charges feel totally wasted when not tanking (or in a low damage phase), whereas on other tanks they can at least get some offensive value out of them.<br />
<br />
This is rather experimental, but we're going to try adding an additional effect to Purifying Brew: &quot;Also increases the damage of your next Breath of Fire by 50%.&quot; (tuning not final of course).<br />
<br />
And FYI, it looks like we are going to be able to fit these latest changes (this one included) into the first PTR build. <br />
<br />
A smarter approach to the cheesing problem, is a 'stagger-per-strike' limit.<br />
A per-hit Stagger limit is not a possible option, since the damage in question is not guaranteed to be a single hit. Ex: Something like Spellblade's Annihilation, or a pack of many adds.<br />
<br />
To be honest all of this &quot;cheesing and brewmaster&quot; thing sounds either like you're totally not aware of the fact that a lot of tank classes are able to cheese different mechanics or just like a bad excuse to make some changes to BRM for no reason.<br />
We are absolutely aware that similar mechanics can be cheesed by other classes. It's a matter of how trivial it is to do, how frequently they can do it, how much external assistance they need, etc. A Paladin being able to Divine Shield through 1 Fel Scythe every 5min is acceptable. A Brewmaster being able to just 2-3x Purify every one of them is not. Guardians are also quite high on ability to do that, which will also be adjusted.<br />
<br />
Please explain exactly how Guardians are being adjusted. We are all extremely interested to hear what your plans are for them. If you're planning on making a thread specifically for them please tell us so we can keep an eye out for one.<br />
We will be discussing Guardians (and others) separately. Please keep this thread to Brewmaster discussion. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1055455-brewmasters-in-725/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753776674?page=17#326))<br />

Eye on Battle Pets —Do You Even Bunny Hop?<br />
With Noblegarden occurring this month, it seemed like a good time to highlight some of the various rabbit or bunny types of pets that pet battlers can collect — including the newest addition the Noblegarden Bunny.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Holiday: New Noblegarden Bunny - Noblegarden kicks off April 16, and you’ll be able to purchase a the new Noblegarden Bunny from the holiday vendor for 100 chocolate. It’s sure to match your holiday finery so get out there and collect those eggs!<br />
Dungeon Achievement: Hopling - Strange things are happening in the Stormstout Brewery, but to see some of those things, you’re going to need a little help from Ling-Ting’s Favorite Tea sold by Auntie Stormstout within the dungeon. Collect the golden hoplings tucked in the nooks and crannies of this dungeon and you’ll earn the Achievement Ling-Ting’s Herbal Journey and a new Hopling companion pet.<br />
Engineering: De-Weaponized Mechanical Companion - You’ll either need to be an Engineer to create the De-Weaponized Mechanical Companion (learned from Gnomish Engineering Trainers at 475) or you’ll need to make friends with one to add this high-tech companion to your collection. This is a great pet for those with allergies. No fur!<br />
Boss Fight: Darkmoon Rabbit - It looks so cute and fluffy, but don’t let the Darkmoon Rabbit fool you. You’re going to need to gather a Raid group and head to the Darkmoon Faire to take on this beast. If you’re lucky, you’ll gain a Darkmoon Rabbit for a companion.<br />
Spawn: Dust Bunny - It doesn’t have to be spring to do a little spring cleaning. Just click on the special rugs found around Dalaran to get the Spring Cleaning buff and then go do a little hunting for Dust Bunnies. You’ll need to do battle to catch them and your buff will only last for 15 minutes.<br />
Pet Battle: Black Lamb - Alright, so it’s not a bunny, but we couldn’t resist throwing the Black Lamb into the mix. It’s spring after all and it’s so cute and fluffy! You’ll need to venture into Elwynn Forest to battle for one of these companions. (Good luck Horde players.)<br />

Apparently the legendary ring that gives the perma slow makes the encounter very doable. Without the ring it seems bugged as the puddles don't slow the mobs (which they obviously should) and the encounter becomes near impossible.<br />
<br />
Funny enough better gear as in Tier 20 won't help here as T20 bonusses are based on being even more of a turret.</div></div><hr />

... those are PVP changes.... where MM is far and away the strongest spec of all hunters...<br />
<br />
MM is also the strongest in PVE of all the hunters and its DPS is completely fine. It's in the top third of all DPS.<br />

Pretty certain that if you're better at playing your class you can do it with a much lower iL thus, what they say is also completely correct.<br />
<br />
What they're saying is, if you can't do it at the moment, its because your bad, but getting better gear will help you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They did say that your gear would matter (the minimum ilvl for some of them is tuned around 910). If you're an 890 prot paladin and you decide to do the challenge your skill won't matter, it's pretty much impossible for you at that stage. <br />

<br />
After getting in a few quick attempts before work, Agatha is 80% ilvl and 20% skill (fuming imps). You need enough dps to get through the healing imps that come often. If you can't do it now, it doesn't mean you're bad because you don't have the dps required to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't speak for prot paladins but I'd like to point out, that 890 gear is a low iL. This is tuned around TOS, which of course isn't out yet, but if you're good at playing your class and you're around 900 you're going to meet this challenge with success. <br />
<br />
If this was &quot;just about iL&quot; I'd be able to enter the challenge and drag my balls over the keyboard until I met with success. This is probably acceptable for BM hunters but certainly not for most other specs.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yeah, and how do you do DPS effs. How do you do DPS? Do you hit one spell over and over or is there some kinda, knowing, some kind of knowledge, some kind of applicable skill that effects the DPS you are able to commit?<br />
<br />
Obviously the fucking thing is tuned, it would be a bit stupid if you could kill it by sneezing on it.</div></div><hr />

DPS is easy to execute. Also this &quot;In the case of these challenge appearances, they are meant to show that you've truly mastered the nuances of your spec&quot; -- They should have said &quot;you've truly mastered gear&quot;. If they didn't make it out to be skill based, there wouldn't be a backlash. (I'm not saying it needs to be nerfed).</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;DPS is easy to execute&quot;.<br />
<br />
And yet, if I look at warcraft logs, it seems like there are a tonne of people who struggle to execute DPS. And that's just logs for Mythic attempts, the picture becomes a lot worse when I look at normal and heroic.... and thats just for people/guilds that actually do log. For those that don't the picture aint gonna be pretty.<br />
<br />
We're playing a game where gearing your character is part of the &quot;skill&quot;. You need to complete harder content, to get better gear; that time trivialises that aspect of it is unimportant. That's like saying YS+0 was easy because we can go back with better gear. It's nonsensical and it's making a point out of nothing.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you want to play a different game where skill is the only factor and I applaud that, I too like to play games that have no factor of time or luck in regards to their completion. <br />
<br />
Expecting gear not to be a factor in WoW though, that is bovine.</div></div><hr />

True enough, skill obviously does come into it. For prot paladins it's a little different, though, what with the boss having twice the hp of the druids'. Not a very good sign when one of the (arguably, some would say) top prot pallies in the world is struggling with it.<br />

They could have made it scale with gear like proving grounds but they chose not to because this way the vast majority of players with 890ilvl and lower gear will have to stay subbed and get more gear. It's there just to extend the lifetime of this content.</div></div><hr />

Overtuned rather than undertuned is always my preference. Dialing things back is a lot easier to do particularly with regards to player complaints. Cats out of the bag if it is undertuned.<br />

Or, some people are just not good enough period and they'd like a way for those players to eventually succeed by gearing up. Pretty common theme in this game now that I think of it.</div></div><hr />

That and not being able to stand and cast any spells, preventing you from using your highest damage spells and instead relying on moonfire spam to weakly dps while the specter of death rapidly accelerates towards you and your inevitable death.

Except those logs are looking at the max percentile for all bosses. If you look at each individual fight, you'll see that MM really only does well on 3 of them; Skorp, Spellblade and Tich. This isn't even considering the fact that a decent player is anywhere between 90-99th percentile, not max, and the average raider is at 70-89, where you can see the MM logs start to do considerably worse. MM has very high throughput on the 3 fights it's good at, and isn't very good on the others.</div></div><hr />

This isn't even considering the fact that a decent player is anywhere between 90-99th percentile, not max, and the average raider is at 70-89, where you can see the MM logs start to do considerably worse. MM has very high throughput on the 3 fights it's good at, and isn't very good on the others.<br />
<br />
So you're telling me that MM is not the best DPS in every fight? Damn it must suck to be MM.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not very good&quot; is entirely misleading, not only is it viable, it is nowhere near the bottom performer. <br />
<br />
Also, player skill is player skill, trying to use that as a gauge for the throughput of a class is dangerous territory. Or to put it frankly - they suck so their dps sucks.<br />
<br />
Sounds like another case of whine, whine, whine because you're not the top performing spec in the game.</div></div><hr />
