You haven't been paying attention. :P<br />

It began the moment they started creating mounts/pets/armor etc. with our subscription money and then charge extra for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkTZeratul</div><div class="date">2014-02-18, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But you get one boost for free with the expansion, right?Yes, which is actually why this service even exists: because Blizzard is well-aware that some people will simply buy a second copy of the game and expansion, make a brand-new 90 on a fresh account, and then merge it over to their main account, and figured that it's better to streamline the process than prevent it.<br />
<br />
So, since the sole reason for offering the service was because people would just buy the expansion pack on a new account and merge their newly-90 character over, I see nothing wrong with pricing it equivalent to buying a new copy of the game + WoD.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dark_Spirit</div><div class="date">2014-02-18, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, they couldn't get a microtransaction expert to work for them. Make sense.<br />

No Blizz, just no.</div></div><hr />

Many people already stated that if there was no paid 90 boost in the store, they would be willing to pay over $100 for a new account + all expansions + the month of time required to activate said account. There are people that do that now with RAF, they recruit themselves with a new account, then level 1-2 characters and buy another account after the month has run out.</div></div><hr />

It's cheaper than to buy another account up to WoD and transfer it over to your account.</div></div><hr />

No one forces you to use it and those who want to come back to the game would appreciate it (if they have the money) The price is fine to keep the multiselling/spamming 90's. I would never plan to use it but making a fuss for adding it then complain about the price (some people here with their posts prove not to have a stable opinion) is just a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This doesn't mean the expansion is going to be over $60 (because it includes a $60 service.) It will very likely still be $40.<br />
<br />
The boost should be compared to battle chest+MoP+WoD+$25 transfer, which is the way to get additional &quot;free&quot; 90s without a paid service. It needs to be cheaper than that when everything is on sale, but expensive enough that you don't have players feeling like they &quot;have&quot; to buy it. $60 is steep enough to discourage people from just boosting every single alt by default, while cheaper and easier than making new accounts.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they are. It doesn't take a week and a half to level to 90 unless you have no arms. But if you can't tell the direction the game is heading after the slew of paid services, I feel bad for you, son. I got 99 problems, but WoW ain't one.</div></div><hr />

with 150 gold and 483 green gear i reckon. so its pretty reasonable. professions get a full boost to 600 (both main ones) but only if you boost a lvl60 or higher char, otherwise you wont get any profession bonus</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maggibesti</div><div class="date">2014-02-18, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was their plan all along. They weren't gonna just gonna give us free 90 boosts for no reason, they're just doing that so they could start selling them also. Get people to buy WoD for free boosts, new players and old players. Then when those return/start, they'll also have the option to buy a level 90 for 60$! Why couldn't they just have made all classes start at 90 for free anyways, have that option to level 1-90 or start at level 90 similar to DK's.<br />
<br />
So now they sell everything except gear, why can't they fix WoW? They're getting money from everything in this game. Subs, pets, mounts, leveling boosts, RaF feature, character and guild transfers, faction changes, expansions. Probably missing something. So how about they start making this game better now? No expansions with lame Orcs and poorly designed. Sure, Garrison is great, but that's all we're getting. We're getting new heroic dungeons and scenarios, and raids. But that's not a &quot;new&quot; feature. It´s just something that comes by default with new expansions, including a few new features. But now, we're not getting anything really. <br />
<br />
Also I haven't really seen much on garrison, but isn't that something that allows you to get things in the game by not playing it anyways? Having the game do the work, instances, farming, whatever there needs to do, except PvP and raiding?<br />
<br />
Maybe this is just a whiny post by me, but just what I see WoW becoming. I'll buy WoD anyways, but not touching this stupid level 90 boost for money. Unless I would be rich maybe, so spending 1000$ wouldn't be any different then spending 1$. But that's not happening anyways in the near future lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
non sense. There's such a thing as value and this is no value. The term &quot;ripped off&quot; comes to mind right away. This is worth nothing more than $25 per boost. hopefully people don't buy it and make an outrage over the pricing. Hopefully it's also a placeholder number and is actually much cheaper. if it stays at $60 it's nothing more than a money grab and not something i would use. Because the boost was something i was looking forward to if the price doesn't come down i'm not buying WoD and they'll lose a 10 yr. customer with 3 recurring monthly accounts.<br />
<br />
So yes i don't like it and i won't buy it. i like boost but at a value price. Your generic response is non sense. Try to think of something to add.</div></div><hr />

To some degree it actually helps you save money because I'm sure that if it was lower, a bunch of people would be wasting your money getting a class to 90 and eventually not playing it because they don't like it.<br />

I agree completely that this is not in any way pay to win, as you start with 483 gear and that does not make you overpowered in any way. I already got almost all classes at max lvl raid geared, and even if I used this I would be at a disadvantage from not gaining all the gold from the leveling process. If people leave over this thats totally their decision, but its over something so small that will have a minor effect to the game. I just hope they use the extra money from this to upgrade their instance servers and give us who farm old content more space so we dont get locked out from too many instances so quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Change Realm: $25.00<br />
Change Faction: $30.00<br />
Change Race in faction: $25.00<br />
Appearance change: $15.00<br />
<br />
All of that is $95.00, and you are still at the level you were at when you purchased that. Now, I will admit that I have never done any of these, but if you want to play with a friend on another server who is 90, do you want to pay for them to transfer, you to transfer, or would you make a new toon and pay to get to 90? That is your decision. If you look at the costs though, Realm and Faction transfer costs $55.00, are you willing to pay $5.00 for an insta 90?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emzky</div><div class="date">2014-02-18, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So they admit the leveling process sucks, and that they are not willing to improve it or shorten it, by introducing a way to pay away boredom. Only 60 bucks folks. I will never understand Blizzard doing this. Though it somewhat makes sense due to the amount of money they've taken from people wanting to move from population fluctuation on servers. Blizzard is simply dirty.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bisso</div><div class="date">2014-02-18, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that price is a great thing. It would discouraged people of using it for all their characters.. <br />
Or they will ruin them and make more money. <br />
<br />
Either way i'm satisfied. It could be a disaster if the price was very cheap<br />
<br />
With what data do you make this claim? Are you sure it will discourage people from using it on all their characters? Because I just read a comment saying he will surely use it on 2-3 characters at $60 a piece ASAP. And as far as I know, the amount of money someone is ready to put in the game isn't an indication of his skills and ability to learn a new class. So free or not, a character boost will add max level characters, and I would assume that the skill ratio of these players will be the same as old toons.<br />
<br />
Now, I guess that if it would be free, it would destroy the 1-90 content (make the whole world empty for good). But I don't think it would change anything else. The game is 10 years old and there are people who play since TBC that still suck balls, others that started in MoP and are on top. Remember that the 90 boost is meant to be for the next expansion where you will still need to level 90 to 100, so good players will have time to adapt, learn, and become good, bad players will remain bad, putting a high price on a boost won't affect their skills all of the sudden.<br />
<br />
They have a financial analysis team that put the price up there, so for the profit, it's probably the best price point. For the respect they will get from their playerbase, not so much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sillysauce</div><div class="date">2014-02-18, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Price is perfectly acceptable. It discourages people from dropping the equivalent of 4 months of subscription to get a level 90 when it doesn't even take 2 weeks to get from 1-90. It's not even a P2W sort of thing because starting at 90 does not teach you how to play your class effectively at all.<br />
<br />
IMO let people waste their money on this and when they can't play their brand new 90 they will understand the error of their actions.</div></div><hr />

I still play on and off. Right now, I'm on an off-phase. The way things are going, it might last longer than the others.<br />

People can still have a vested interest in things which they no longer participate. It's not an impossibility. At least someone like me cares about the quality of the game and the effects on the community, unlike people like you and the others who post &quot;good riddance&quot; to anyone leaving WoW or with any complaints. That's a great way to make sure the game strives and continues to expand, rather than stagnates and die.</div></div><hr />

So yes it is a reasonable price: you get one free, but if you want more level or pay somethink for it. But i would really like to see something like a 2 hour-testing-phase where you can play the class and if you don't like it, you can delete it and use the 90-boost on another class.<br />
<br />
Also i don't give anything about it: i have 8 90s, and until WoD I have 11 of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldn't agree more although personally I think they should up the price to £90 and $90 and €90, make it equal to 1 pound/dollar/euro per level... It'll help push a gap difference between the idea that WoW is becoming free2play/pay2win while still giving people an advantage on boosting alts they're serious about while maintaining life in the zones for those who will/like to level up normally.<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna be bothering myself with the next expansion, happily keeping my Emi at 90 for the foreseeable future unless they do a special offer on Warlords at some point like they have with previous expansions i.e around the £4-£5 mark. There's plenty new mmo's on the horizon with 1 in particular having caught my eye ;)<br />
<br />
Wish nothing but the best to those that will stick with WoW, it was a great game, but after 9yrs I've just seen the game changed too much for my liking any more.</div></div><hr />

Those who use this &quot;I gonna leave cuz its too expensive&quot; really come on. makes me lul in real just thought of people saying things like that. <br />

This boost price is perfect it stops those who sell accounts from overly abusing it, and stops general people from overly abusing it. also stop the Muility boxing (seen lot more of those lately people playing 5 toons at once). ok not stop it but put it to a lesser dagree</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty shocked. I was very much expecting this to land in the $45 range. Personally, this is to high for me to EVER justify it, granted my lowest level character is 60, the rest 85-90, so it seems like a waste. This is going to be a huge bummer to my college friends that wan't to boost to 90 and play with me, a deterrent if anything.<br />

I have never looked at character sales but I would imagine this is much cheaper, and legal, than paying someone to level a toon to 90. The fact that the price is what the collectors edition would be proves that subs are more important than just boosting to 90. Personally I have enough toons at 90 to damn near fill my own 25 man raid and most folks I know have at least 3 or more and with the expansion a ways off people are starting to get the end of expac jitters and leveling more.

You realize that $60 is more expensive than any expansion that has ever come out right? And you are skipping leveling... which only provides you with lore, time investment and some gold for your trials and tribulations.<br />

If you think the game has mattered pre-max level other than vanilla you're gona have a bad time.</div></div><hr />

Does it really matter though?<br />
<br />
I've only levelled 9 - but it's a price I'd be willing to pay IF I desired anything more than the one more I'll be getting with the expac. If that price stands, it's more than worth the time I'd have to put in AGAIN for content I don't want to go through AGAIN just to level.<br />

I'm pretty shocked. I was very much expecting this to land in the $45 range. Personally, this is to high for me to EVER justify it, granted my lowest level character is 60, the rest 85-90, so it seems like a waste. This is going to be a huge bummer to my college friends that wan't to boost to 90 and play with me, a deterrent if anything.<br />
<br />
As much as a surprise this is, a lot of you are acting like god damn drama queens. Go ahead and quit.<br />

I think $60 might keep enough people from just buying endless 90's, but I am a little disappointed that it is not going to cost the lazy people more. Leveling these days is nothing, with all the perks one get. RAF is a joke 300% xp in dungeons, seriously should not take more than a day or two to get to cap, even without heirloom. If you put them in a guild you get even more perks from that and not to mention the amount of xp per quest and mob are also through the roof compared to years past. <br />
<br />
I was really hoping for a dollar per level to really make it non-attractive for most people to not want to do it. If you are getting the primary profession boost and a level 90, then you are really getting something on the cheap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The high price keeps the level 90 boost as a WoD feature first and foremost, and should limit the number of people using it and keep traditional leveling somewhat relevant. The only reason they are selling them directly at all was because of a loophole that existed that would of allowed people to create whole new accounts and transfer a boosted 90 to their main one. Since that loophole would of cost a minimum of $100 to exploit (assuming MoP gets bundled with the base game or comes free with WoD) when a sale wasn't going on, the $60 cost is actually a bargain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
#1: The cheapest power-leveling service I could find charges $140 for 1-90... over twice the price.<br />
<br />
#2: It takes 80 to 100 hours to level to 90... for some people, a lot longer. Blizzard is charging the equivalent of $0.75 a hour to level your character. Would YOU accept a rate of $0.75 an hour to level characters? I sure as hell wouldn't!!<br />
<br />
#3: If there was no 'barrier to entry' every stupid failure of a person would have tons of instant 90's. Do you REALLY want that many people who have no clue how to play their class running around? At least it'll be cut down by the fact that someone REALLY has to want it enough.<br />
<br />
If you think Blizzard is being greedy... how else are they suppose to make sure its a BIG decision for people? Sell it for $10 and limit it to one a year?</div></div><hr />

When did having a 90 mean winning. Get a grip...it's just a toon. Still have to play it. There are thousands of 90s running around failing at LFR already.

It sounds like we are better off without you then. <br />

It isn't pay to win at all. You arent buying any gear, you aren't buying progression, you are just buying a max level toon that they throw through a tutorial on how to play it so you can play the content that is current.

Some people want more than 1 toon to be leveled through this method. If you purchase another expansion pack you need another account to throw it on, then you need to pay $25 to transfer it to your main account. Expansion plus transfer already costs more than the 90 boost, not counting sub fees/previous expansions/base game.</div></div><hr />

By lazy, do you mean people with demanding full time jobs and families that want to try out a higher level character, but who have far more money than free time? Take, for example, a father who works 40-50 hours a week, coaches soccer for his daughter, volunteers at the local PTO and food pantry, but would like to play with his son who already has a level 90?

It's a prince intended to discourage people from just throwing money at a 90 boost. Even then it's an optional service that doesn't give any advantage at all, since you still need to learn the class you're boosting.<br />
<br />
Calm down kids.<br />
<br />
Not to mention it does not provide max professions/gold/mounts etc. And it is right around the corner for having to level that 90 to 100.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. The people crying about this are being completely over dramatic.</div></div><hr />

I mean I just googled it and MoP standard on release was $39.99 and I doubt they will increase that price by $20 for WoD as this would be insane and people will complain or just not buy it at all.<br />
<br />
cuz you need to buy the other expansions as well plus the transfer fee, unless you want to pay the sub for Two or more accounts which is what Blizz is trying to avoid<br />
<br />
Last I checked you cannot just buy Mists of Pandaria without the other expansions first</div></div><hr />

More and more items/services are being added to the store, and the speed of items being added to the store has only increased over the years. Now we're getting new shit added to store almost every month. And now we're also getting instant level 90's that cost 60$ / 50€.<br />
<br />
WoW has around 7 million active players (5 million less than WotLK) and Bli$$ard needs to make up the lost money. They do that by being greedy dicks and acting very desperate. They also do it by releasing a new mount for the shop every once in a while (which actually look better than most in-game mounts, cause in-game mounts are just lazy re-skinned mounts, for example the mount you get after you obtained 200 mounts. It's a complete pathetic re-skin, and that's not the only re-skin there is. Challenge Mode Silver also has re-skinned Hippogriphs, while the Shop has awesome, fearsome looking beasts that look very epic... but guess what? €20.) They're also adding Shop buttons everywhere begging for you to click on them. Oh my, one of them even has a gold bar around it for instant level 90, because hey, it's obvious that not all players were aware of the shop yet, and Taepsilium (whatever his name is) literally said they want EVERYONE to know about the shop.<br />
<br />
Yes, that were his actual words. It's fucking disgusting to say the least. <br />
<br />
EVERYONE is aware of the shop. It's on the Bnet launcher, it's on the website, there are advertisements. And I even get E-mails from Blizzard, and the latest E-mail I got was about the Iron Skyreaver asking me to buy it. It's so pathetic. And even for people that like the shop, they only buy something once and never click on it ever again. There are also a lot of people who enjoy LFR and the recent Raid Finder tool that includes Ordos and Celestials. But you don't see 3 buttons for that, you don't see advertisements, you don't see it on the website, and you don't get E-mails, now do you? Instead, the recent Raid Finer tool is hidden away in the Social panel and requires you to dig through a few menu's.<br />
<br />
And now the paid level 90's will cost 60$ / 50€ and Blizzard will not revert these changes. Incoming in WoD: Garrison architecture for ~40 bucks and crap like that.<br />
<br />
How low this company has fallen. Guess you just had to follow EA and other companies who inject money into their veins every day.<br />
<br />
/endrant <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone who's complaining about the $60 price is retarded.<br />
<br />
What a well thought of and such a nice response. As usual, the Blizzard Defence Force is at work here in this thread. Any posts that give criticism or any sort of negativity or even pessimism, and they will insult you with their usual bullcrap.<br />
<br />
I'm done here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Huntingbear_grimbatol</div><div class="date">2014-02-18, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm actually pleasantly surprised that it's this expensive, I've said in the past (and I'll stick to it) that IF Blizzard decides to launch a bunch of &quot;luxury&quot; effects (like level boosts) or extremely iconic transmog items / mounts should be made exclusive with a (very) steep cost. I buyed Spectral Tiger (and several other TCG items on Ebay, including tabards) and if Blizzard goes into selling those themselves (or similar items) then there's going to be unlimited availability to them so unless you want to see everyone run around with specialty mounts (like every single store mount so far) the prices has to be high (even higher than this level boost). And before you start yelling and shouting &quot;Oh cash grab!&quot; &quot;This is the start of the end!&quot; &quot;Sky is falling, ESO is the wow killer&quot; (it really isn't)... 60$ for a boost to 90 (which doesn't mean you'll see a lvl 100 boost when WoD just releases). IF, and only if, we see a lvl 100 boost it's going to be when WoD essentially is over. You won't see a lvl 100 boost at launch!<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that you still get a lvl 90 boost with WoD CE, maybe this is going to be something for every CE in the future to allow old players to come back to an expansion and actually participate with the new expansion instead of having to spend a couple weeks before to &quot;get ready&quot;. One of the biggest drawbacks to any MMO is that it's extremely hard to get into: Expensive, monthly fee, having to play for a few weeks before you can play with your friends (or find people/friends to play with).<br />
<br />
This 60$ lvl 90 boost is (my guess anyways) additional boosts outside the CE version, this is a perfectly fine pricing if you ask me. Am I going to buy it? No, I'll stick with my CE once boost. I'm not much of an alt person and IF I were then I'd level it myself, this (imo) is specifically for those who has more money than time to level alts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilurm</div><div class="date">2014-02-18, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By lazy, do you mean people with demanding full time jobs and families that want to try out a higher level character, but who have far more money than free time? Take, for example, a father who works 40-50 hours a week, coaches soccer for his daughter, volunteers at the local PTO and food pantry, but would like to play with his son who already has a level 90? Perhaps your definition of lazy is different than mine...<br />
<br />
Perhaps your definition of playing a game is different than what it should be. Leveling is part of the game too. Father wants to play with his son? Son makes a lvl 1 and they start together. There.</div></div><hr />
