Considering his health-pool... not for long.<br />

In the specific case of Shadow Priests, there is exactly one ability that requires a nerf, and that's Surrender To Madness.<br />
<br />
It's the only effect that's not touched here.<br />
<br />
If you're not S2M speced, you're currently mid-line in DPS. Those nerfs will make you low dps in the process of dropping the S2M specialization to &quot;reasonable&quot; levels. So apparently, Blizzard expects you to spec S2M, even if your gameplay isn't good enough to sustain it.</div></div><hr />

There was already blue post tagging SP as one trick pony and saying we should be glad that we are no-trick pony! this is what we are supporting by purchasing expansion and paying monthly... not sure if guy who resonded think this kind of reply, indirectly insulting, is entertaining to SP lot or he's just naturally retarded.<br />
<br />
Imo there should be minimal difference like -/+ 10-20k dps among classes in dps, especially in ST and difference should be made with utility and class specifics<br />
<br />
I personally feel terrible playing shadow in M EN... we are still progreassing and my dps until StM is just above our paly tank and in most attempts i don't even have the chance to get to go full retard with StM coz of wipes... <br />
<br />
I'm also altoholic and i can proudly say that, compared to my other five 110s, Spriest is the worst class for WQ and casual pvp by far... doing WQ as disc GG</div></div><hr />

A guild member finally got their first legendary yesterday, and then two hours later, they got a second one - the same one! That's a fun bug.<br />
<br />
Their new method of legendaries just doesn't work in this game. Sure, having rare items with an odd-but-beneficial aspect to them is cool. But WoW has been all about min-maxing to get the most out of your stats for ages. Of course people are going to want a specific legendary, and then be disappointed when they get something else. That's how it's been forever. They've made this game that way. You can't undo it at this point.</div></div><hr />

You clearly have no idea what you are talking about. Elemental and Destruction is crazy good in Mythic + and raids right now. Frost DK is really damn good aswell after the latest buffs.

Affliction just got a buff in these notes so we will have to wait and see. Unholy single target needs buff. AoE a nerf.<br />

I simply cannot fathom this right now. I can't. Not a single thing for Elemental who are absolutely awful in raiding. <br />
<br />
This proves to me that the design intent for Elemental is to be a 5-man Dungeon spec. Not a raiding spec or a PvP spec. <br />
<br />
Let me guess, &quot;Elemental Shamans are overpowered, they just don't know it yet.&quot; <br />
<br />
Great job, Ian ... between your Q&amp;A response in regards to Elemental, your &quot;oversight&quot; on the recent buffs ... one can only think that you're not even interested in Elemental at all outside of 5 man dungeons. If I wanted 5-man dungeons, I'd be playing a different game. Which is a good possibility if 7.1 goes live like this for Elemental.<br />

We have a tracker on our guild's website showing the one person in the guild who has 4 legendaries now (across three characters) Almost everyone else is still struggling to get their first. One of our tanks switched mains from DK to DH because the DH got an awesome tanking legendary... seriously, is this where WoW is headed? Spend hours on end on a character only to end up more and more frustrated as you don't get a legendary drop or get it on an alt that has trashy gear and barely any playtime.<br />

I guess the plan at this point is to level as many alts as possible and throw them all at world quests in the hopes that one would get a legendary that you can then commit to being your main. And don't even get me started on the stupidity that is hidden appearances that drop from raid bosses. My main (bear tank) has killed Ursoc every week on multiple difficulties, no drop... we bring a resto druid along for the first time, bam, hidden appearance for bear form? Really? Shoulda just made it a rep purchase off Dreamweavers and be done with it... much like MM hunters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Hey. Arcane mages have significant issues with mana. Oh I know. Lets make their spells cost even MORE so they have even less casts!&quot;<br />
<br />
If you recall, last hotfix they change the secondary stat weights for Arcane Mages, making Mastery their best secondary stat... that means they can currently cast more spells than was ever originally intended -- in fact, as an Arcane Mage myself -- I have zero issues with mana right now. <br />
<br />
I will absolutely take the Arcane Mage buff in damage for a few less casts in the games current state. The nerf to Fire Mages will hopefully make the two specs more even in DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Elemental, Destruction, Affliction, Unholy and Frost DK need a buff.<br />
Retri, Arms, Enhancer a nerf.<br />
<br />
It really is not that hard. Also you mentioned balance changes before 7.1. Where are they with 7.1 due next week?<br />

<br />
Retribution biggest change for 7.1, Chrusade rework, just got reverted back to Live state so... Yash.. With rework of Blades of Wrath which is currently on Live adding small DoT to our spell to being RNG PPM Insta CD on same spell in 7.1. it looks like Ret took a slight hit too. Not the fist in the face, but sure smack over the ass.<br />
<br />
As a Retri paladin i can say that Retries not only that they dont need the Nerf, they need to be seriously looked at, their gameplay looks clunky and stat priority is bonkers too, giving the Haste top priority by far for OPTIMAL performance. BoM mechanic is also really strange move, to have your DPS depending on other peoples DPS in your raid is.. well strange decision. If buffed player dies its a flat DPS loss for you. etc etc. They stay true melee utility class still, doing moderate ST and AoE dps.<br />
<br />
What youre seeing is a trinket macroed with AW to give us INSANE DPS boost for the time is up. Faulty Countermeasure (http://www.wowhead.com/item=137539/faulty-countermeasure&amp;bonus=1826), mentioned trinket, is actually so good that its our BiS trinket.<br />
And to have a class where lower ilvl piece of gear with more Haste on it is actually a gain over higher ilvl piece without haste on it and a case where dungeon trinket, even lower ilvl one, beats any raid trinket by far is something wrong with design choices and should be looked @.</div></div><hr />

This is someone from Blizzard releasing this info like they did with Kosumoth and some of the hidden artifact skins. I dont believe actual players are smart enough to figure any of the hidden stuff out. Its like saying, &quot;keep clicking on a murloc npc in Azuna until you get a prompt from him then figure out to find 4 hidden murlocs in underwater caves hidden under seaweed. But you have to make sure you touch the seaweed for the murloc to appear. Then you get an item in which you have to figure out that you have to only kill every 1st boss on all 10 mythic dungeons, but it has to be in a certain order and within the 11th minute of every hour. This is Bullshit. All this is gated content by Blizzard coders and programmers. They decide when to release this stuff. <br />
<br />
As for the Legendary items players have to come to the realization like myself who has completed all reputations, done all dungeons normal - mythic plus 5 multiple times and finished LFR Emerald Nightmare yesterday that I'm not going to get one anytime soon. Probably not even during the end of the expansion. The reason being Blizzards system which is based on luck and not guarantee. The same goes for the Horseman mount. I have done that shit every year with multiple alts since burning crusade. I'm never going to get that as well. Someone who just started playing this game has a higher percentage base on getting this stuff than long time players. Blizzard themselves can investigate these claims and they will see that I'm right.<br />
<br />
Another thing is when you create a quest it should be able to be completed in any difficulty like, &quot;Piercing the veil, The essence of Power and In Nightmares questline&quot;. Some quests say complete in normal or higher which I understand. But 90 percent of the players will not complete these quests because they cant be done in LFR. Getting those 30 essence is random and every boss does not drop them. This needs to change because once Karazhan is released next week and Nighthold next month no one is going to do Emerald Nightmare. This is gating players to finish the balance of power achievement to obtain a new artifact skin. <br />
<br />
Another thing...Fix your First Aid Achievement &quot;Is there a medic in the zone&quot;. I complete this quest over the weekend and when I get credit it resets the following day.</div></div><hr />

like Vargur says, not all of us are using StM<br />
<br />
seriously dev team, wake up<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah. It's odd. I mean, you make a stupid build which requires a player to die(which as such is not fun at all and would have to be really, really, really rewarding, e.g. beat ALL other classes hands down to make up for that), screw up all other builds......then you notice that mistake...and as a fix you weaken all other builds EVEN MORE and say &quot;we gonna need some time to fix it properly, have fun till then&quot;(it's not like you had an alpha or beta or something).<br />
When it comes to shadow we had some very bad releases in the past that usually needed several fixes to get it even halfway right(shadow was never great)....but this one got to be the worst one ever.</div></div><hr />

AoE a nerf.<br />
<br />
Arms, Fire Mage and MM Hunter needs nerf, nothing else IMO (shadow already got it in these notes).<br />

<br />
Frost mage, Frost DK, and Affliction lock are the only 3 specs that needed minor buffs. Every other class/spec in the game is already doing 300k-400k+ DPS on just about every encounter in the raid. MM Hunters, Spriest, and Fire mages needed a nerf. Anyone who follows wowprogress or warcraftlogs knows those three specs are ridiculous right now.</div></div><hr />
