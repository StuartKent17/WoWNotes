Blizzard Community…<br />
<br />
Over the past few months, I’ve met with many people throughout Blizzard, talking about how we create our future. One thing that remains constant: we are committed to creating epic games and entertainment experiences. <br />
<br />
Our development pipeline is strong, and we have the largest lineup of games that we’ve ever had. At the same time, Blizzard tries to have a level of craftsmanship and excellence in all that we do. Maintaining those standards as we continue expanding these worlds takes both time and talented developers.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, we have plans to add to game development. We are dedicated to bringing you more content across existing game franchises and bringing our unannounced projects to life. Esports and the Overwatch League are also important priorities, and we will continue to produce great competitive content. <br />
<br />
To better support these priorities, we need to reorganize some of our non-development teams. As a result, we will be reducing the number of non-development positions in North America and anticipate a related process in our regional offices over the coming months subject to local requirements. This was an extremely difficult decision, and we want to acknowledge the effort of everyone who has contributed to Blizzard. To assist with the transition, we are offering each impacted employee a severance package that includes additional pay, benefits continuation, and career and recruiting support to help them find their next opportunity. These people are members of the Blizzard family—they’ve cared deeply and contributed greatly to our work here and we are extremely grateful for all they’ve done.<br />
<br />
As difficult as some of these organizational changes are, I am confident in Blizzard’s future and we will continue working hard to live up to not only our mission, but your expectations. We look forward to sharing everything with you when it’s ready.<br />
<br />

He didn't lay of 800 people you schmuck. Activision BLizzard employs 9600 people GLOBALLY, and 8% of that is 750 people across all branches of the company, including Activision, King, and Blizzard. <br />
<br />
Don't be stupid, and shut your fucking mouth before you talk bad about people when you come from complete ignorance.<br />

I was laid off by Blizzard in 2012 after working there for 7 years. This is a shitty day for a lot of people, and you're not helping.<br />

“While our financial results for 2018 were the best in our history, we didn’t realize our full potential.&quot;<br />

No-one should tweet the people that got sacked &quot;Learn To Code&quot; as it's obvious not even that will save you from rogue marketing departments that set you up to fail by demanding &quot;engagement&quot; over quality (for want of a better word).</div></div><hr />

At any rate, as I understood it, it was Activision that took the biggest hit with Destiny 2 jumping ship and Call of Duty failing to sell as well as they had hoped.

OWL is still making bank, they just signed on more teams at millions of dollars a team, this is why OW isn't going anywhere, even though the game itself is bleeding players like crazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />

I mean, that's how companies operate. Few companies keep employees out of the goodness of their heart. They keep them because not keeping them would make them less money, one way or another. The moment they think they'll make more money by letting someone go, they usually will.<br />
<br />
That being said, companies are not infallible, and cutting staff isn't always the best thing to do. Whether or not that is the case here, though, is very difficult to gauge. People are quick to make their own judgment and come to their own conclusions, and to ridicule companies' decisions - but don't forget that a lot of people are involved in making those decisions, and a lot of people have a financial interest in ensuring that they are good decisions. It's not a perfect safeguard, of course, but it carries more weight than Mr. Rando Commando on the forums going &quot;lulz Blizz so bad firing all the people that would make the game AWESOME&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I honestly doubt about that 2012 firing, but this is the Internet where almost everything is possible. However even if it was 1 person being layed off, as you should be aware, it sucks that does not mean you get to call everyone shit because they critised a high ranking individual trying to apply some sugar to this shitty situation.<br />
<br />
You seem to be unable to understand that there are people who thinks that layoffs are shit, and in quite profitable years, double shitty.</div></div><hr />

Remember people cycle in and out of large companies all the time as departments are created and dissolved as needed, Example, all the teams Activision Blizzard Holdings assigned to different aspects of Destiny are not no longer needed so they are moved to other project where possible and the rest laid off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Companies exist to make money. Companies, including Blizzard, have been make decisions to make them more money. Just because you've made a good profit doesn't mean that your company can ignore potential problems with in it. If you want to be just another parrot by all means parrot away. Its not like other players in the industry are not doing the same.<br />

<br />
The &quot; pay &quot; will be a couple of weeks paychecks, the &quot; continued benefits &quot; will be COBRA ( insurance you gotta pay 100% for), and the &quot; career opportunity and job placement &quot; is nothing more than sending you to the unemployment department to get your unemployment and hooked up to a site that gives you lists of jobs you would never want.<br />

Seriously. Are you on drugs? I am not saying they fired actual plumbers. They clearly laid off people they think they do not need. They clearly have restructured their company as a whole. You don't need to know the specific names and duties of each person fired in order to know what restructuring is and why it is needed even for profitable companies.<br />

It certainly is an option. But like I said restructuring needs to happen even if you make a profit. I would use the great plumber example again but you clearly don't understand it. They also need to attract a good CFO and executives if they hope to keep running the company. Cutting pay and other things can often lead to a disaster for a company even if it seems greedy not to.<br />

<br />
Which is why if as a company you find you have 10 plumbers to fix 1 toilet you let some of the plumbers go. Just as if you find you have to many CM's for what you need, or think you need, you let some go. Consider the level of toxicity you are showing towards Blizzard with out understanding basic concepts of business it is clear that no amount of CM's will fix the toxic nature of WoW.</div></div><hr />

I guess it is if they want to hire a CFO more than you want to continue employing brand awareness experts, social media strategists, community managers, etc. etc.<br />

How long have they been with the company? We've already heard from one guy that basically got nothing.<br />

I've also been through 3 factory closings in 15 years, 2 of which were a hell of a lot bigger than Blizzard ever thought about being. If they did get that they should consider themselves very lucky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's be honest - it's hard to reconcile Kotick talking about record profits, when they're restructuring. The changes may be necessary, but the timing is awful. They may have made the decision to do this now, instead of later in the quarter, because the stock price is so low, and if they start going back up, announcements of layoffs months from now would eat that growth with more drops. Kind of yanking the bandaid instead of slowly peeling it off kind of thing.<br />
<br />
I'd prefer nobody gets laid off, but I'm just a meathead who posts on gaming sites. <br />
<br />
I'll be honest, I was expecting 200 people, but 800 was eyebrow raising. It says there are more internal issues across the board than I even considered. If you add it all up - new CEOs for King and Activision, layoffs, rumors of finance being more involved, etc, it all adds up to &quot;not working, we need to fix this&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Kotick wants more money&quot;. IF Blizzard were still printing money, and Activision releasing plenty of new games that didn't suck, if eSports had taken off like they hoped, if King wasn't stagnating, this wouldn't be happening - so yeah, it is proactive, in a very real sense, and in line with typical corporate thinking these days. And is in line with my theory Blizzard grew too fast, and their internal processes didn't. <br />
<br />
I'm all for the idea of them doing a Nintendo and the execs sacrificing their millions, in exchange for better/more employee salaries and job security...well, lets be real, that's not gonna happen. Today really sucks for a lot of people is all you can really say.</div></div><hr />

Every company I've worked for that went through layoffs, severance was always based on tenure. Some who worked for only a year isn't getting a year's salary. Going by some of the tweets, some of those laid off did not get a year's pay.</div></div><hr />

Corporate Japanese has some really awful practices, but they at least take responsibility for their actions and most of them do work to take care of their employees' futures. This level of greed from ActiBlizz shown on both sides of the company is just beyond absurd. Blizzard is really burning the bridges with their core audience. I hope future years are some of the least profitable in their history until they get rid of their current leadership and ditch their high profit at all costs corporate mindset.<br />
Wanting to make money is ok, in a sense it is a measure of success in today's world. Wanting to succeed at the cost of alienating everyone around you, particularly if those people actively helped you succeed, is not ok and should not be tolerated.

<br />
Over the past few months that Activision has finally managed to put a shill like me in the lead for all Blizzard endeavours, I've met with many people throughout Blizzard that I happily fired to improve marketshare and revenue gains. One thing remains constant: We still didn't fire enough people to turn profits.<br />
<br />
Our lootbox economy is strong, and we have the largest pile of bullshit to draw from whenever we need to convince our customers and shareholders alike that &quot;new projects are still in the work.<br />
With that in mind, we have plans to add more to the bullshit pile. We are dedicated to bringing you more bullshit across our franchises that are still making money and bringing our announced &quot;unannounced projects&quot; to the depths of MTX hell. Esports and Overwatch are also still on our calendar to cancel, and we will continue to ship great bullshit.<br />
To better support this bullshit, we need to fire the degenerates in our company working for a measly income to support their children because we feel they're not building enough MTX. As a result, many people will lose their jobs and I'll mull it over with some caviar with my higher up friends. Do know we care.<br />
<br />
As difficult as some of this organizational bullshit is, I am confident I will earn enough money to set me for life before Blizzard drowns. Oh and don't forget about the unannounced projects, they're still in the works. Buy your Blizzcon tickets for 399,- while you're at it to see our next best thing: Starcraft Mobile Rivals!<br />
<br />
Not even sincerely, J. Allen Brack</div></div><hr />

That is the most stupid logic I've heard so far. NO ONE should have to worry about having their career instantly destroyed, because some greedy CEOs decided they wanted bigger bonuses. The fact you compare having job secure to an &quot;adult foster care&quot;, shows just what kind of ass you are.

<br />
True. I think this is just very shitty timing for this. I'd bet this has been in the works a while - and they may have delayed this through the holidays, so people's Xmas wasn't ruined (and finances, as that time of year is expensive for many.)<br />
<br />
If you look at it from a business point of view, what is probably going on is Brack and Kotick/ATVI have been taking a look at the state of the company (and the same happening over at Activision and King), and they determined that a restructuring was needed - that's also very common for new presidents to do, as well. They have internal issues getting games out, the ones they have are starting to stagnate, and there seems to have been some serious issues in the Diablo camp, what with talk of the game being rebooted twice. They have to do SOMETHING, and they're also looking at their stock price being in the toilet, which doesn't help matters at all - and is a direct result of the issues they're looking at. They made a lot of money for 2018, but going forward, not so much - and 2019 looks bleak as fuck with nothing new to release. <br />
<br />
So, they're restructering, they've decided. That's never easy, been through a couple myself. And layoffs are common during them. Do they do it now, while the stock is low...or later on, when they might have gained some ground in the price, and lose that to bad PR from publically announced layoffs...or take the hit now, at what they hope is the lowest point? And, they negotiate the amount of layoffs, Blizzard may have less of a percentage than Activision, depending on what's being decided in the new structure that's being hammered out.<br />
<br />
That's what executives get paid big bucks to decide. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. Will this? No way to know. They're talking growth and more games, faster, but...I'm skeptical. Brack has to show his plan works, it's way too early to tell. Blizzard obviously has to do something, and what they were doing wasn't working. I prefer companies choose not to lay people off, but it's not my call to make - and I don't know the actual decision making involved here.<br />
<br />
Or, you can just bellow &quot;KOTICK WANTS ALL THE MONIES I HOPE HE DIES&quot;, and move on to the next drama.</div></div><hr />

How are the CEO's getting larger bonuses here if they are also hiring 20% more developers? They fired 8% to hire 20% means they are greedy? If those employees had non-essential jobs or jobs that could be done by one there is no reason to keep them around. Bloat is common in companies as they grow. While &quot;adult foster care&quot; is harsh it doesn't mean Activision is greedy, bad, or anything else for doing this.<br />
<br />
You are not greedy by increase the amount of payroll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being laid off does not destroy a career, it impacts it, but most of the people involved will find new jobs. Layoffs suck hard, but they're not always the end of someone's career, especially the younger workers like the ones impacted today, they're all 20's and 30's, they have their whole careers ahead of them, once they work through this and land in new jobs. <br />
<br />
Lay offs are a reality. Want to change it? Become a CEO and change the industry from within. Don't do business with corporations that use layoffs to solve financial issues. And understand that no job is guaranteed. Shit happens, sometimes even good companies make mistakes or get impacted by things outside of their control.</div></div><hr />

<br />
12% net increase in jobs isn't greed. You are not greedy by increase the amount of payroll.<br />
<br />
20% of 5 is 1.<br />
<br />
8% of the company is 800.<br />
<br />
There is a reason they used percentages when defining how many developers they're going to hire, because it's not going to be anything close to 800 people. <br />
<br />
They fired 800 to hire what? Maybe 50-100 people? That is a net loss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What will a developer do to promote esports? They have more then one priority and developing more for their games as a whole is one of them. While it isn't 20% of the entire company it is still a large increase for an entire company to do. This isn't just doubling down on their cash cow but making a commitment to the entire portfolio. Redundant or bloated jobs should not be valued the same as in-demand ones.<br />
<br />
While I misspoke with net increase it still isn't greed by any shot to fire someone people to hire others.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a CEO. I'm not even an American. I am however, very well familiar with the European business bloat and what can only be described as adoption by companies, rather than a normal hiring process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong, there isn't a 12% net increase of jobs at all. It was 8% of various positions throughout the WHOLE company. The dev team is a rather small part of the company, so 20% could be maybe a couple dozen new people at most. That, compared to 800... You do the math...<br />
<br />
So yes, they are greedy, because they are putting A LOT of money back into their pockets, rather than guaranteeing their hard working employees a secure job.</div></div><hr />

It is standard practice. Companies lay off workers all the time to reorganize. It sucks. It isn't anything new. The Auto Industry used to have to pay people to sleep and read newspapers because it was in the Union contracts to have X people even if there weren't jobs. As companies grow and change some jobs are no longer needed as others are needed more.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with capitalism with oversight or boot-licking. It has everything to do with running a business.<br />

So they should keep employees just because they are an employee? Even if their isn't work for them to do? They should pay two people to do the job of one just because? They are not greedy at all. It is a business they are supposed to make money while not wasting money.</div></div><hr />

pretty much, and before people say &quot;blizz shill defending blizz&quot; i am NOT AT ALL happy about how this turned out, i was skeptical as it seemed we could use some removal of uneeded roles, possibly in games that are less developed right now like SC, diablo, and heros...

There are very few CFO's qualified to take on that responsibility for a multi-billion dollar company in that market space. It's also bad to be ignoring the fact that the signing bonus was primarily in stock and tied to specific performance targets.</div></div><hr />

Theres mention of the eSports improvements but they just canned HoTSs eSports division driving pro players and streamers away causing the game to really only be played by casuals. The game is sadly losing interest rapidly. They just released a highly desirable hero and he was met with a mild applause.<br />
<br />
At any rate, as I understood it, it was Activision that took the biggest hit with Destiny 2 jumping ship and Call of Duty failing to sell as well as they had hoped. Basically, Blizzard is being dragged down because of Activisions poor performance. Wonder if Blizz can somehow manage to cut ties with that anchor<br />
<br />
I wish. Really sucks how much negativity is around Blizzard right now. Sucks for the employees, I hope the devs can pump out something fresh next year...</div></div><hr />

He got a $3.75 million signing bonus. He got a $1.35 million target bonus. He got 11.3 million of stock tied to income and earnings-per-share targets. With a starting salary of 900k the $5.1 million bonus is not that large give the position for a company like Activision-Blizzard. The 11.3 million will not be his if he doesn't meet the requirements.<br />

<br />
Because the positions aren't &quot;not needed&quot; and wouldn't be considered &quot;not needed&quot; by a company that cares about consumer relations.<br />
<br />
A major reason Acti-Blizz shares tanked so hard on the market was a failure to understand the consumers. They were so out of touch they produced garbage nobody wanted, the obvious example being D:I. Instead of trying to do a better job, they simply purged all the departments that had anything to do with it. Instead of bad consumer relations, they have none now. <br />
<br />
Reorganizing a company is just an excuse. There is no need whatsoever to fire these people. The company is more than profitable enough for everyone to be employed, but not profitable enough for the shareholders who want more money (ignoring that it was their own disastrous decisions that tanked the company value in the first place)</div></div><hr />

While it does sound unfair if you look at it naively, that's just not how business works - or how any of these events really correlate. They didn't fire people to pay out that bonus, and to imply so is dangerously reductive. Companies are very complex structures with many moving parts, and you need to work hard to keep everything working efficiently. Carrying elements you don't really need anymore is not efficient. WoW, while still very profitable, has undeniably been shrinking. A lot of the support/service/community staff is simply redundant now. They had to go at some point, and an earnings call is simply often a strategically convenient time to do so. It does skew perception somewhat for people with low understanding of business, though, and it's no surprise this happened in this case - press releases like Big Bob's &quot;we made more money than ever, so we're letting 800 people go&quot; are just cringe to read, but investors tend to understand what this is really about. And they're the ones Blizz is worried about most.<br />
<br />
Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not gleefully watching people lose their jobs. That always sucks. But I don't pretend that it's not a reality of capitalism. It's not a reflection on those people, or their worth as human beings. It's just what business have to do, sometimes. Whether or not them doing it was correct this time, well, that's a different question. I don't feel competent enough to answer that question, but a lot of people were involved in making that decision so it's unlikely to be completely inane.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How do you know these positions really are needed? How do you know that consumer relations will be impacted and not met by other people still working there? Profitable enough still doesn't mean you never have to reorganize. I think that is where the disconnect here is. You don't understand how to run a business. You think that just because you are making enough money you never should fire people or have a reason to fire anyone.<br />
<br />
Record profits isn't profitable enough for share holders? And what profits do they want? Non-record? No company will keep people around just for the sake of it. One of the people let go was listed as social media for Destiny and WoW. Why would you keep a person who worked for a division that isn't even part of the company? And yet you are saying it is good business to keep that person on the payroll even though 50% of his job was eliminated. Huh.<br />

<br />
Ythisens was a Blizzard employee. He was fired. You're wrong, and you're spreading misinformation telling people Blizzard didn't fire anyone. <br />
In any case, obviously not every employee out of the 800 terminated was a Blizzard employee. I never said it was Brack who fired them. The point still stands. They didn't have to fire anyone, they could've hired 20% more devs (probably about 100 people) and kept the other 800.<br />
<br />
You do realize that they never said Blizzard didn't fire anyone. And that your &quot;in any case&quot; is actually what they said. You are inventing arguments for no reason. Of course they had to fire some people. Do you think they would keep destiny support in the company when destiny is no longer part of the company? You want them to pay for jobs that don't exist anymore just so people don't have to be fired? What logical sense is that? Come to work and don't do anything because we can't be seen as bad for firing you when your job no longer exists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, yes, February 2012.<br />
<br />
A time that involved late-Cataclysm LFR, Annual Passes, Mists being announced, shortly following the Cannibal Corpse controversy at BlizzCon 2011, etc.<br />
<br />
People were still mad. This was still a critical moment in which people had low trust in Blizzard, so the blowback in 2012 - yes, I remember it - still had a sizeable impact from the timeliness of the community reaction.<br />
<br />
When I say people don't care about facts, I'm not saying that a lot of the claims are untrue. I'm just saying people are going to hatewatch seeing things tank harder because WoW's community is, and has often been, addicted to theatrics and anger.<br />
<br />
For the record, I'm not defending these decisions, I think Brack, Kotick, etc. can fucking shove it and Blizzard as a company has been going this route since Wrath. But I find the reactions funny considering some of the people saying them and what they're saying.<br />
<br />
(Though I think &quot;Blizzard laid off employees&quot; here is, while not wholly incorrect, reductive in terms of semantics)<br />
<br />
This kind of corporate disgust happens on the daily. People are in part as fervent about it here because they're also passionate about what it represents.</div></div><hr />

there are quite a few positions in the news post about CMs, esports and PR jobs. i think that in these times, those are the people needed RIGHT NOW to talk to the community.<br />
<br />
but that is it. this is the moment. this is what mike morhaime saw when he got overwhelmed by applause at the opening ceremony of blizzcon 2018. he saw all those passionate fans - and knew his diablo team would betray them. he saw many people from his company - and knew bobby nodick would betray them. he even saw the two destiny players - and knew that they would soon be free from bobby.<br />
<br />
he saw all this and you can just see it on his face. the look of someone who knows what will happen in the next few months. and the whole diablo immortal debacle is probably one of the most important factors for the online hate and memeing about blizzard and subsequently the plummeting of their shares. that is all so sick.</div></div><hr />

For those detrimental tasks you need a large pile of paid forum-posters and 'social media strategists'. And then they realize that they've opened the floodgates and need more and more of these 'communication experts' to counter the ever increasing toxic cry-baby herds that live on those forums. You're paying good shareholder's money to an ever-increasing army of non-developers which bring in absolutely zero revenue for the game's investors, you know, the people who actually invest in the companies so they can make games for us.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is finally cutting off the useless fat of the way too large group of paid non-developers so they can hopefully once again bring us decent quality content for the games we are paying money for to play. Too many people do not see that. Also, there are lots of lists of gaming companies posting jobs for the laid-off people. Those positions are not for non-developers, they're all about coding, designing and managing infrastructure. You know, useful stuff when you want to make games. None of these postings are about full time positions as 'brand-forwarding social media marketing expert strategists', whatever the hell that even means.<br />
<br />
I do not want to say learn to code, because it is not a job everyone likes or wants to do and you have to respect that. And of course being laid off sucks and puts you in a financial situation. But you can not whine about a commercial stock-driven nasdaq company about wanting to make more money so they're restructuring staff to focus more on the departments that actually enable them to make money.</div></div><hr />

The examples I gave are simply that, examples of a fact of life and fact of markets. Did I try to justify it? No. I stated that the company isn’t do well and this is a side effect of that. <br />

You don't need 10 plumbers to fix 1 toilet, but you can need 10 CMs to fix a toxic or broken community. Your analogy doesn't fit the situation, so it's useless and asinine.<br />
<br />
This community will be toxic to it's end, you can't fix people's entitlement and personality. If they see how the &quot;community&quot; treats Lore (even if he deserves it or not) the first thing they will think is &quot;We have CM's for this?&quot; and the first thing they will cut are CM's. It's because the community is so toxic that it's not necessary to have that many CM. Or at least I think that.<br />

Which is why if as a company you find you have 10 plumbers to fix 1 toilet you let some of the plumbers go. Just as if you find you have to many CM's for what you need, or think you need, you let some go. Consider the level of toxicity you are showing towards Blizzard with out understanding basic concepts of business it is clear that no amount of CM's will fix the toxic nature of WoW.<br />

<br />
Well, to be fair, there are many factors, bad management being one of the possibilities to why your business is failing. And since salaries is the highest cost a company has, letting people go is the most impactful cost cutting measure they have. <br />
<br />
That said, Blizzard is not a wasteful company that has flopped, they make tons of money...just not enough to keep growing at the same rate. And shareholders want to the stocks to rise so they can sell and see a profit. If they can't make the company more valuable through higher income, they'll try to make up for it by cutting costs instead. The numbers will look better for a while, so they can get out at a higher price, and they don't give a damn about how it affects the company in the future. Indeed the darker side of capitalism.</div></div><hr />

In any case, obviously not every employee out of the 800 terminated was a Blizzard employee. I never said it was Brack who fired them. <br />
<br />
The point still stands. They didn't have to fire anyone, they could've hired 20% more devs (probably about 100 people) and kept the other 800.<br />
<br />
Why are you so dense? He says that 800 is not all from blizzard, is 800 across all under actvi, and some of those 800 are blizzard employees.<br />

<br />
but that is it. this is the moment. this is what mike morhaime saw when he got overwhelmed by applause at the opening ceremony of blizzcon 2018. he saw all those passionate fans - and knew his diablo team would betray them. he saw many people from his company - and knew bobby nodick would betray them. he even saw the two destiny players - and knew that they would soon be free from bobby.<br />
<br />
he saw all this and you can just see it on his face. the look of someone who knows what will happen in the next few months. and the whole diablo immortal debacle is probably one of the most important factors for the online hate and memeing about blizzard and subsequently the plummeting of their shares. that is all so sick.<br />
<br />
What community? the toxic one? I love wow but this community is shit, I would prefer being CM of League of legends, that community is quite amazing outside of the game. No one want's to talk to this community, why waste money in it?.<br />
<br />
P.D: I'm sorry for those CM's that lost their jobs, even if what blizzard is doing it's not wrong, some of them really wanted to retire there and were amazing.</div></div><hr />

They didn't fire people to pay out that bonus, and to imply so is dangerously reductive. Companies are very complex structures with many moving parts, and you need to work hard to keep everything working efficiently. Carrying elements you don't really need anymore is not efficient. WoW, while still very profitable, has undeniably been shrinking. A lot of the support/service/community staff is simply redundant now. They had to go at some point, and an earnings call is simply often a strategically convenient time to do so. It does skew perception somewhat for people with low understanding of business, though, and it's no surprise this happened in this case - press releases like Big Bob's &quot;we made more money than ever, so we're letting 800 people go&quot; are just cringe to read, but investors tend to understand what this is really about. And they're the ones Blizz is worried about most.<br />
<br />
Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not gleefully watching people lose their jobs. That always sucks. But I don't pretend that it's not a reality of capitalism. It's not a reflection on those people, or their worth as human beings. It's just what business have to do, sometimes. Whether or not them doing it was correct this time, well, that's a different question. I don't feel competent enough to answer that question, but a lot of people were involved in making that decision so it's unlikely to be completely inane.<br />
<br />
Like I mentioned I have an idea of how corporations work. Yet sacking a 30k/year position is a drop in the sea compared to the multimillion sums over glorified accountants get. These money aren't high because they are of some omnipotent demigod ability and their work is magic and immaculate, it is the result of financial layering which is arranged so by these same over glorified accountants. <br />
<br />
Either way I did not ask for an explanation of how business is misunderstood. I point that sacking people with micro salaries is squeezing the company for a few more cents which could be easily sourced through reigning in the ridiculous bonusing top positions accumolate. <br />
<br />
That is not to say I support some sort of socialistic redistribution of wealth, but it is high management decision whether and how cost cutting can be achieved and mass layoffs in highly profitable companies aren't the only option.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eduwneso</div><div class="date">2019-02-13, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest mistake these big gaming companies ever made was trying to 'get in touch with their playerbase' in order to 'listen to their feedback' and making sure 'everyone was heard'. For those detrimental tasks you need a large pile of paid forum-posters and 'social media strategists'. And then they realize that they've opened the floodgates and need more and more of these 'communication experts' to counter the ever increasing toxic cry-baby herds that live on those forums. You're paying good shareholder's money to an ever-increasing army of non-developers which bring in absolutely zero revenue for the game's investors, you know, the people who actually invest in the companies so they can make games for us.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is finally cutting off the useless fat of the way too large group of paid non-developers so they can hopefully once again bring us decent quality content for the games we are paying money for to play. Too many people do not see that. Also, there are lots of lists of gaming companies posting jobs for the laid-off people. Those positions are not for non-developers, they're all about coding, designing and managing infrastructure. You know, useful stuff when you want to make games. None of these postings are about full time positions as 'brand-forwarding social media marketing expert strategists', whatever the hell that even means.<br />
<br />
I do not want to say learn to code, because it is not a job everyone likes or wants to do and you have to respect that. And of course being laid off sucks and puts you in a financial situation. But you can not whine about a commercial stock-driven nasdaq company about wanting to make more money so they're restructuring staff to focus more on the departments that actually enable them to make money.<br />
<br />
+1 here, I don't agreed 100% but I feel you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eduwneso</div><div class="date">2019-02-13, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I’m not complaining. Yes, it sucks people are losing their jobs, but it’s also a fact of life that sometimes these things happen. People have been hoping for the downfall of Blizz and making countless forum threads about the game dying and the company having problems. This is a side effect of those topics. <br />
Guess what, sales go down, companies cut people.<br />
I’m just honestly surprised we heard anything about it. Imagine all the other companies in the world that have fired employees we never hear about. 800 is a hell of a lot to us, but when you consider the company has some 9600 employees that’s less than 9% of their employees. A company I work for had to pay off employees due to budgets and we lost 6 people out of 45. Luckily we bounced back and were able to rehire some. That aside, as terrible as it is for those employees to lose their jobs, it’s a fact of life that these unfortunate things happen.<br />
<br />
I agree, but, those 800 are not all of blizzard I guess you know that by the data you are providing here, and also, people forget stuff when convenient, Mike morhaime or how is written, laid off 600 employers FROM BLIZZARD in 2012, but hey, long live Mike, and we are totally not in a hate train direction shitshow and because 800 employees of Actvi, some brom blizzard, are being laid off now, this is a bigger shitshow than that was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imagine people forgetting Mike communicated a laid off 600 employees from Blizzard, not ACTVI, blizzard in 2012, but hey, long live Mike! this new one is an asshole! let's forget stuff! This is not how companies who are in nasdaq work!<br />
<br />
About the thing of 2012:<br />

https://www.engadget.com/2012/02/29/blizzard-laying-off-600-staff-globally/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_cs=blDB8iqEhW0hHSM3lvFsjw<br />
<br />
Let's be clear, it's hard, and I really feel sorry for the ones that have been laid off. But it happens and if the company truly wants to reestructure, they are not wrong, it could have been done better, but they are not evil incarnate. I wonder why do they even communicate this, as others have pointed out, other major companies don't tell shit about this.</div></div><hr />

Um, that was bad then and it's bad now. What the fuck are you even blabbing about? Nobody should be surprised that this is happening, but if you're mad now and you weren't before it's good you're finally coming around, if you're still defending them umm let's just say I'm amazed you're able to make it out of your door with your shoes properly tied.<br />
<br />
Let's be fucking real clear about something, if you're one of the most profitable companies in your business like Blizzard is, and you pay your employees well below industry standards, you are a shitty company to work for and you deserve all the hate being thrown at you. <br />
<br />
If you're a person that just enjoys Blizzard games and you're defending them here, seek professional medical help immediately because you're clearly not well.</div></div><hr />

First of all, I apologize for the way I talked to you, this is not how one should talk to others here, sometimes anonymity gets the better of me.<br />
<br />
As I said after that, I don't think they are wrong in doing these layoff from non-development, but it's not good also. If I search deep down from what I really feel, it would be sadness for the ones being laid off, as some of them really loved working there, and while I don't defend them doing so, as you said, I'm not surprised and neither mad and anything on the line.<br />
<br />
Again, sorry!</div></div><hr />

You speak for nobody but yourself, plenty of people cared and that is part of why they quit the game. It has really been nothing but a steady decline in subs since Cata with occasional increases in population when a new expansion or patch is released.

I love how we have somehow put a gate as to what &quot;gaming&quot; is... Remember back when anything that was electronic and was a little game was... A game? Most games we used to get called nerds for playing, are now &quot;casual mobile ripoffs&quot; ice climbers, there is hundreds of games like that on mobile that... Apparently arnt games, but back then sure as hell were<br />
<br />

It's not a fair comparison though. Japanese values are completely different than those in the US. No way would a Japanese company make record profits and say it it failed to reach it's full potential and lay off 8% of it's workforce.</div></div><hr />
