Look like Blizzard are nerfing those boss or else those guys would die from exhaustion from trying and trying to kill those boss. 100% unhealthily. If a non-mythic guild keep hitting the enrage timer on a non-mythic boss, they don't wait for Blizzard to nerf it, they try a normal amount of time, then give up for next week where they will come back more powerful, with new gear from the reclear and more artifact point.

Read the whole article, you're not informed enough to ask questions, he answers this. They're 930 on a boss dropping 930, yes they're geared enough, if they can't kill it, it's not killable, it's that simple</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except they're ~7 ilvl below max with zero gear from Avatar/KJ and zero gear WF/TF, so no, they had room to grow. The weapon and legendaries boost it a lot</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did, he even say &quot;yes, it’s a bit inaccurate due to 2 legendaries and weapon, but still`&quot;. A bit innaccurate? 2 legendary + a full mythic weapon give you 101 more Item Level, so an average between 5 and 6. So if his group is mostly 929 like he said, he is about 6 or 7 IL behind. When you are at the two last boss of a raid, it not to much to ask you to get those 5 iLevel higher next week and be able to kill him without the Dev nerfing it for you.<br />
<br />
Do some research before calling someone not informed enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ilvl only will not give you &quot;100% readiness&quot;.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard is tunning the raid for the T20 gear (which includes the trinkets effects, tier bonuses and all that), you may be a little bit behind coming to the party with non-T20 gear, even if all maxed out titanforged.<br />
<br />
The thing is, mythic gear from the current tier is supposed to get you an edge for the next tier, but not exactly give it all to you on a silver plate. It is supposed to, yes, make you rush trough normal/heroic and some of the mythic content of the next tier. All the rest is about how good your group is and if that old gear (or a mix of old gear + heroic/mythic current gear) is enough.<br />
<br />
Exorsus do have some valid points, but they're also crying a little (more than a little to be honest). They've (the top hardcore guilds) created all this situation with their PTR raiding, non-stop progression raiding hours, split runs, legendary farm runs, leveling plenty of characters (even of the same class to speed up the legendary drops), etc. Now deal with it and accept when someone else beats you.<br />
<br />
Saying that all the bosses should be avaible on PTR? For god sake. The best thing on this (actually lame) world 1st race business is watching the top guilds dealing with the bosses they're discovering in &quot;real time&quot; for the 1st time. 0 fun seeing them just rushing the mythic content repeating what they did on PTR. <br />
<br />
This is as laughable as they saying that they don't use the PTR for it. Since he said that they just test a few things. Ok.<br />
<br />
Also, Blizzard nerfing the bosses after the world 1st is nothing new. What's new is the ones killing (but not W1st right) it complaining. Blizzard is even taking things a little bit slower now with the nerfs. Just remember what they did to Firelands as soon as someone killed Ragnaros... destroying the entire raid by making it a loot pinata (except for Ragnaros in the end).<br />
<br />
And saying that Nighthold was better balanced over ToS? Hahahahaha even Blizzard said they did things wrong with NH. You don't have progression there, you would kill 3 bosses, then hit a wall unless you were a min max raid that farmed the hell out of the game to get everything maxed out. It would be ballanced if that happened at the end like ToS, but right at the 3rd boss? Ok. Hahahaha ToS is far better in that regard.</div></div><hr />
