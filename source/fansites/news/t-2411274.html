With the Battle for Azeroth pre-patch, you’ll notice that the vendor who sold tokens that granted a random Legion Legendary item will now allow you to purchase specific Legion Legendaries relevant to your specialization. These are sold for the same cost that the token was sold for previously.<br />
<br />
Battle for Azeroth is just around the corner, so we wanted to take this opportunity to allow players who are trying to complete their Legendary collections a more straightforward way to do so, as well as give or new or returning players a way to pick up some strong items to prepare for leveling.<br />
<br />
These items can be purchased from Arcanomancer Vridiel in Dalaran for 1000 Wakening Essence. To help with this, many sources of Artifact Power will now grant Wakening Essences instead. Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

And instead of 'RNG' whines we would have 'GRIND' (if it would take months) or 'NOTHING TO DO' (if it would take weeks) whines ;P<br />

I wonder if it will continue in BfA. I would love to complete my collection or use it for stuff like timewalking (since timewalking 'reduce' your level, it should be usable, right?).</div></div><hr />

Cause you would be able to get to 120 without changing gear at all. And they want you to try out that amazing effortless green.</div></div><hr />

Because the high of being super overpowered with all legendaries will feel really bad the moment you step into BfA.<br />

So <br />
1. no real way to confirm this is you<br />
2. so you DONT have CE for all raids, you have it for old raids.<br />
Also easiest shown is MoP so you have CE since mop, but not the last 2 raid teirs.<br />

1. That character was created 9 months before his MMOC account, which is pretty narrow for a 14 year old game and makes perfect sense in every way. And you've no reason to suspect otherwise other than you really want to because it makes you look pretty silly.<br />

<br />
It's a double edged sword. I'd much rather grind for the specific legendaries than HOPE I got the ones I needed early on. I liked the Legendary system, but without the horrible RNG aspect of it, it would've been a damn near perfect system. At least BFA is giving you the ability to target specific pieces of Azerite gear instead of hoping you get the best one for your class. They are removing a lot of RNG elements in BFA and I think that alone will carry the expansion.</div></div><hr />

EU servers, thats the american release date, yes we got sha of fear 2 hours before the servers went down, only raiding 9 hours a week that was the hardest and closest tier for us, we only killed protectors and amber shaper &amp; empress once each extending the raid just to get the bosses down we did it with crap gear.<br />
<br />
and yes i don't have the last 2 as i said i quit, but you can go back and see i got all of wotlk achis (except ulduar because i moved house) before the release of the next raid.<br />

there were zero nerfs to the tier for the first tier of MoP and it was really short had 16 bosses to get through, sha was a near 20 minute encounter. That combined with a 9 hour raiding week was by far the hardest tier to cutting edge in the history of WoW from my PoV.<br />

yeah i don't like they way they did legendaries at all, then the fact you can just purchase the exact legendary makes specific epics much harder to obtain, it was a good experiment but i hope they never do it again. Still it was better than WoD we have that to be thankful for.</div></div><hr />

Pretty wrong.<br />
<br />
1. Legendary effects stop at 115.<br />
2. Main stat is more important than secondary stats now as they scale much faster.<br />
3. You'd still replace your legendaries around 115-116 because of the main stat gains.</div></div><hr />

This is completely false. <br />
No spec requires a legandary of any type. 900-910 ilvl and whatever drops first is more than adequate for all of them</div></div><hr />

Honestly why not just keep mage tower up till launch even. Honestly i still don't get the idea of removing content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, getting those legendaries in the last 4 weeks before they go obsolete, while artifacts will be useless and your char is so changed, raiding will be difficult, is definitely worth not grinding and having had those legendaries for months, usable in current content...</div></div><hr />

Am I the only one who would rather have AP items than essence from WQ's? Unless I can vendor the essence for gold, I'll care even less about the WQ's. To be fair, I finished all my druid's legendaries ages ago. Even on my alts, I've started to care less about legendary drops even with this change, since they're going away soon anyways. It'll just feel worse when you have to give up those legendary effects at 116. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
14 hours a week? I'll one up you all, in MoP I raided 25 hours a week, 5 hours every raid session, we were world 70 at that time. They're world 28 now, I guess I could still come back to that level of raiding, but that would require me to ask my boss to not include night shifts in days of X and Y just so I could raid, which is somewhat ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Raiding in legion was a chore, not a pleasure anymore. All the fucking extra grind outside of raids made me quit as well. MoP was the best, after the initial dailies were done for professions, you capped your valor etc, you could've just raidlogged... I miss those times, where skill meant more than the time you had on your hands for grinding outside of raids.<br />

Not at all alone, it's just that it took this long for Blizzard to finally completely fix the Legendary system and it's almost at the point when it's already far too late. Is it really worth it grinding Legendaries for alts you may or may not level in BfA? For the 5-6 levels you are able to use them, which is literally questing through 1 zone in BfA or couple of hours of gameplay. <br />
<br />
I'm personally so burned out by RNG Legendaries and the grinding and waiting for them to drop that I probably won't even do the new WQ's at all. I've already got my share of Legendaries (easily 100+++ spread on my characters).</div></div><hr />

oh fucking lord how did you have a life!? I have a hard time finding time to raid right now, roleplay, and keep up with my alts.<br />
If you want to see what my progress is. (I quit organized raiding just before our guild heroic gul'dan kill. But I had already gotten it without them ahead of time. Also I had to make a new account end of WOTLK cause i was at the age my brother did not want me playing on his account anymore.)<br />

I think it's basically just to make the Legion content more evergreen now that it's outdated, with Wakening Essence replacing many of the old AP rewards. This way people can go back and consistently collect Legendaries if they want, or obtain some while leveling through the content, which could give them some decent quality gear that lasts them part of the way into BFA.<br />
<br />
Though not being able to target specific legendaries was definitely always the weak part of the Legion legendary system. I think randomly obtaining tokens that you can trade in for a Legendary of your choice would have been much better than getting a completely random Legendary, and it would have kept the randomness in the system.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
what a slap in the face to people who were grinding legendaries since day 1 lmao. RIP old school MMORPGS that awarded you for dedication and grind.<br />
Yeah, just like level 61 quest rewards were a slap in the face to all the people who grinded epics in Molten Core.<br />
<br />
Spoiler: Old content becomes trivial.<br />
<br />
What are they going to use it for, anyway? You'll have like a month to mess around with old Legion content before BFA launches. Everyone who really cared about Legion content will be long done with it.</div></div><hr />
