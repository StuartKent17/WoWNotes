<br />
Now up for adoption in the Pet Store: the Cinder Kitten, a fiery little feline looking for a home to warm. Adopt this adorable rascal, and you’ll help bring relief to the victims of Superstorm Sandy in the process.<br />
<br />
From now until December 31, 2012 at 11:59 p.m. PST, 100% of the $10 USD adoption fee will be donated to the American Red Cross's Superstorm Sandy relief efforts. This support will enable the Red Cross to provide shelter, food, emotional support, and other assistance to victims of this disaster.<br />
<br />
The Cinder Kitten doesn’t just have good looks -- this kitty has claws, and makes a purrfect addition to any Pet Battle team. The Cinder Kitten has Rare-quality stats and is a part of the Elemental family. This not-so-cool cat uses many Beast abilities in addition to Dragonkin and Elemental, and can also Prowl, Leap, and Rend its way to a 3-hit combo against its foes—and look good doing it.<br />
<br />

Not the best battle pet, but it is a small niche, being Elemental with mostly Beast-type attacks (so, good against Critters with Mechanical attacks... like that even exists).<br />

It's like that with quite a few charities, if not all of them. Salvation Army uses some of their funds to promote their politics, Red Cross holds on to some of the funds for future events and not necessarily uses them on the current tragedies, etc. Good heads up, though, some people may not know how Red Cross works.<br />
<br />
They're generally a pretty good charity, though.</div></div><hr />

Does not having this pet effect your game play in anyway? No it doesn't. No-one has a gun to your head, forcing you to buy it...Some people just expect everything in WoW to be dished to them on a silver spoon..</div></div><hr />

100% of the proceeds go to charity. Why are you complaining?<br />
<br />
Also, these pets and mounts don't just create themselves, they are designed by artists who are paid salaries. I'm not denying that it is a ridiculous profit margin for Blizzard, but they are putting hard work in to provide you OPTIONAL CONTENT that you are in no way shape or form required to buy.<br />
<br />
Plus I bought 2, one for me and one for you since you're obviously not buying one. But you can't has it!</div></div><hr />

Wait, are you seriously complaining about this? This is something where, for the time being at least, 100% of the proceeds are going towards a charity that does a heck of a lot of good work across the planet and you are complaining it isn't free?? I sincerely hope you just didn't take a moment to read what Blizzard is doing with the money.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because those affected by the storm did some wrong by you... Honestly, if you're just posting for the fact that you want to be a dick, then at least post a header so we can skip it.

I'd rather donate to people who actually need it (children dying of starvation in Africa or something) instead of to the richest, most powerful country on earth who apparently can't even take care of itself. But by all means, buy your pet and pretend to do good.</div></div><hr />

You need to &quot;lrn2redgud&quot;, it's specifically mentioned that &quot;100% of the $10 USD adoption fee will be donated to the American Red Cross's Superstorm Sandy relief efforts&quot; NOT the euro or anything else. So you might want to actually read what's posted instead of making a fool out of yourself by making comments like this. Oh yea and continue thinking that human suffering only matters if it happens in your own country.<br />
<br />
I can't believe people are complaining about this, considering that 100% of the proceeds in the US go to charity and the vast majority of sales are within that first month I think Blizzard is being pretty altruistic all things being said (they are a corporation and their bottom line is about making money for themselves). <br />

<br />
What's China got to do with this? :P<br />
<br />
Also I can tell that you're clearly going to back up your claim and donate to &quot;children dying of starvation in Africa or something&quot;... Give me a break, you're just using this as an excuse to validate your own hatred for anything Blizzard does due to some fake slight they visited on you god knows when. Donating to the Red Cross is always worth while no matter where they're helping so stop being miserly and buy the damn thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think you understand how this donation thing works in the slightest.<br />
<br />
100% of all donations go towards Red Cross, helping people who lost a lot in the superstorm. Red Cross is easily one of the best charities out there. You aren't giving it to the American government, or the richest people in this country, but the people who lost a lot.<br />
<br />
I bet you would LOVE it if the &quot;richest, most powerful country on Earth&quot; even donated a bit towards your country if it got hit by a natural disaster.</div></div><hr />

Did you know that you pay them 180 millions every months to work and you pay an extra 10$ for something you already paid. <br />
<br />
Everything related with WoW should be obtainable ingame AKA free. <br />
<br />
That's why I hate Blizzard sometime, but the worst is that lot of people like that...<br />
<br />
Quit complaining, Nothing is ever free. This is for charity its worth it and I bought 5, ya i spent 50 bucks. Gunna pass them out to guild mates who can't donate any money but will get a pet.<br />
<br />
Its sad that people still complain even though Blizzard gets 0 of the money for the pet from now until Dec 31st. Sometimes I wonder if its even members of the WoW community or people just trying to rally some kind of revolt.</div></div><hr />

BTW for the few folks who are complaining and pointing out that the US is Rich and Powerful, they are getting help. However not everyone in this country is Rich, a lot of folks have to work a few jobs just to have enough to have a roof over their heads and put food on the table. Living in NYC is expensive no matter where you go. Moving to other states is often not an option because jobs are scarce for those folks at that level of income. The majority of folks here are NOT born with a silver spoon in their mouths. <br />
<br />
My wife and I work very hard for what we have and I thank God I was not in an area that was hit as hard as others. I lost power, heat and water for a week. That is nothing compared to those who lost their lives or entire homes and every belonging they have. My company compenstated me for the entire week I could not get into work so I had no financial impact either. There are those who no longer have a place of business to go to anymore. <br />
<br />
The message is simple, everyone can use a hand every once in awhile. And just because the King and his family and friends are rich, the subjects are often toiling away just to feed themselves.</div></div><hr />

You should realize some truth to what world charities are and what happens with them, this is something so many people don't want to admit to themselves.<br />
<br />
World aid organizations, ones that try to get you to give money to poorer countries or war torn countries, it does not matter how much money you give them, you could have every major celebrity give millions to these aid organizations for help starving children and people dying of disease over there... <br />
<br />
And those children will still be dying and the people will still be contacting disease, and continue to live in poverty. The aid organizations are powerless to help those people, because every bit of aid that comes to them, goes into the pockets of the evil bastards that take everything from the poor people in those countries. <br />
<br />
In other words, poor people in rich countires are giving aid, to line the pockets of rich people in poor countries.<br />
<br />
http://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2012/10/foreign-aid-why-it-will-never-work/<br />
<br />
This is why, at least with more at home organizations close to your own country, you have far more guarantee of doing any good with your money. If you think giving a few pounds/dollars to help dying children in a third world country will make a difference, your just making it worse. Keep your money, give it to at home charities. Its awful, but you really won't make any difference despite what the aid foundations tell you.</div></div><hr />

Not to sound rude to teh yanks here, but this sandy thing was a while ago...haven't they gotten all the help they needed? Like what is Blizz providing? An extra blanket?

<br />
Here's a tidbit on what American Red Cross is going to do with future donations:<br />
<br />
Any funds donated for Sandy beyond what is needed for emergency relief will be put to use serving the long-term needs of those affected by this disaster. The Red Cross is already working with communities to determine unmet needs and how they can be met—something which will continue into the recovery process.<br />
<br />
The Red Cross is developing specific plans that will include a comprehensive needs assessment of the affected communities and individuals; plans that will identify resources available from both the Red Cross and other organizations. Recognizing that each community will have different needs, and different groups working to meet them, the role of the Red Cross will be determined by these local needs. What’s crucial is that there is community collaboration and cooperation to ensure that longer-term help reaches people who need it.<br />

Haha... and they said blizzard isn't trying to nickel and dime you where ever they go... ohh my sides hurt.All the pets are $10. 100% of the proceeds from the Cinder Kitty go to American Red Cross until Dec 31st.<br />
<br />
In 2009, the Pandaren Monk enabled World of Warcraft players to raise over $1,100,000 in support of the Make-A-Wish foundation. Make-A-Wish foundation has branches serving in 47 countries.<br />
<br />
In 2010, the Moonkin Hatchling enabled World of Warcraft players to raise over $800,000 in support of the Make-A-Wish foundation.<br />
<br />
In 2011, the Cenarion Hatchling enabled World of Warcraft players to raise over $1,900,000 in support of the American Red Cross's Japan Earthquake and Pacific Tsunami relief efforts.<br />
<br />
Why is it a problem that Blizzard sells a pet for the American Red Cross's Hurricane Sandy relief effort when they have an annual history of doing charity pet sales, which benefit other nations within Blizzard's subscription base? The primary &quot;profit&quot; period is all given to charity, while only the residual revenue (what is made after the initial release) hits their P&amp;L. At least Blizzard doesn't do like some companies and try to sell junk items to &quot;support a cause&quot;. They offer items their base actually shows an interest in.<br />

<br />
Also, these pets and mounts don't just create themselves, they are designed by artists who are paid salaries. I'm not denying that it is a ridiculous profit margin for Blizzard, but they are putting hard work in to provide you OPTIONAL CONTENT that you are in no way shape or form required to buy.<br />
<br />
Plus I bought 2, one for me and one for you since you're obviously not buying one. But you can't has it!<br />
<br />
Hey, pet for charity is fine. Charging 10 bucks is fine for it too. But &quot;these pets and mounts&quot; are mostly just reskins of existing in-game mounts and pets. So yes, they basically create themselves. It isn't hard work at all. <br />
<br />
If any of these pets are worth $10 in dev time, we all should be paying $25,000 or more for each expansion on a dev time basis.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't care if Blizzard makes a crapload of money on mini pets. Good for them, it's good business. But don't tell me any of this is to pay for salaries or that it takes hard work to do. This is all cherries on top of the proverbial sundae. The amount of content we get for our monthly fee is a piss poor return on investment. But that is why Vivendi can ask for 8 Billion dollars for their 61% stake in Activision/Blizzard. They get the most money out of their clients for the least amount of actual effort they can get away with. It's the right thing to do for investors and the bottom line but you cannot tell me we couldn't get more &quot;stuff&quot; for our money and have Blizzard still be super profitable.<br />
<br />
New pets and mounts are cool. And if people wish to pay Blizzard more money for them, that is their choice. But to think ANY mount or pet sold on the Blizzard store is anything but 100% profit to Blizzard (or in this case, a donation to a good cause) is just naivety.<br />
<br />
Also, it's a slick move making $ and € equal in value. I do a lot of work in both the USA and UK/EU and if I billed my UK/EU with the same values as USA with just a different symbol, they would rapidly move elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

Not the same, when you donate at the ATM or whaterver, you receive your tax credit, because YOU donate. <br />
<br />
When Blizzard sell you something and donate the money, they receive the tax credit. <br />

Yeah, but you're getting a cute pet out of the deal. It's not like we don't know what we're in for. They get a tax donation and applause for donating money and encouraging donations, and we get a cute flamey kitten out of it. If we want the tax break, we can just donate the money ourselves. Some people would rather do that. Some would rather have the kitten. Some people will do both.<br />
<br />
Either way, who are you to judge?</div></div><hr />

Yea! Shame on all those people who are giving a little bit more to help people in need! ps. not everyone needs a Blizzard pet to do charity. I've already donated as much as I could, and I'm still going to buy this pet. Why? Because every little bit helps. Not only do I get a cute little kitty pet that I've been wanting for a while, but I get to help out that little bit more. I don't know the exact subscription numbers right now, but let's pretend it's 10 million. They have a potential 100 million dollars they could get from their customers to help people in need, and that is somehow bad or wrong?<br />
<br />
Not everyone is doing it for charity, most people would have bought it regardless.</div></div><hr />

no blizzard made the pet with THEIR money you pay to allow blizzard to give you access to THEIR game they own the characters on the account you play and the account itself they have the right to ban you for any reason and to do anything they want with your characters.<br />
<br />
once you hand them the money it is non refundable which means it belongs to them they can do what they want with it and they can charge for dlc if they want to its THEIR dlc. <br />
<br />
im tired of how some people in the wow community feels entitled to things. if blizzard wanted to they could charge a fee for patches since patches are basically free dlc</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what the $15 a month sub is for. It's not free DLC, in fact it's pretty damned expensive DLC, with content patches at at 3-4 months apart you are basically paying $45-$60 per DLC. Sure it's their right to charge that if they please but don't be telling people they are acting entitled because of all the &quot;free&quot; shit they are getting.</div></div><hr />

I actually did buy it for charity, and I also donated on my own. So quit being so negative. :| <br />
<br />
Big fucking deal, people bought it and also donated at the same time. Why the hell are people up in arms about this shit? Between this news thread and the European WoW website, I don't know which one is filled with the most jerks.</div></div><hr />

If your intention was to also give money to charity, that's a nice gesture on your part, but you are not doing it for charity. That's same as me talking about how i support local schools because everytime i go to the grocery store i pay a tax that further goes to my local municipal which funds the schools. If you really were buying it for charity, you'd buy the pet for the victims of the hurricane, meaning your money would go to red cross while at the same time you'd give what you paid for to charity.<br />
Again, it's nice of all of you who do buy it while considering that money goes to the charity, would be great if more people'd do it, myself included.</div></div><hr />

Did you know that you pay them 180 millions every months to work and you pay an extra 10$ for something you already paid. <br />

Everything related with WoW should be obtainable ingame AKA free. <br />
<br />
That's why I hate Blizzard sometime, but the worst is that lot of people like that...<br />
<br />
You mad because some players like to pay blizzard for the extra content they provide?

If you don't want to give the money to the charity via Blizzard then don't. Give it direct or to any other charity you wish.</div></div><hr />

Dont think they could care less, this goes to the USA victims of Sandy only, not a cent to Carribien victims that imo was hit worse, not in dollar damage but in human life and human suffering.</div></div><hr />

This is why, at least with more at home organizations close to your own country, you have far more guarantee of doing any good with your money. If you think giving a few pounds/dollars to help dying children in a third world country will make a difference, your just making it worse. Keep your money, give it to at home charities. Its awful, but you really won't make any difference despite what the aid foundations tell you.<br />
<br />
I am glad the proceeds of this pet are going to charity.<br />

Hi Trassk, <br />
<br />
Thanks for the link, it was a nice read. It's always good to educate the masses on enigmas like Foreign Aid; FYI Foreign Aid is quite a contentious issue in the UK right now so your thoughts and link are well received here at least !</div></div><hr />

I don't think people are lying... but the charity part probably helps a lot of people 'decide' on purchasing it. I purchased two, one for myself and the other my girlfriend; but I wouldn't have gotten either if it wasn't for the charity part. So did I do it for charity? No. Did I do it for the pet? No. It's both, it's a win win situation, and that's how I see most people purchasing this pet.<br />
<br />
Oh and lighten up :P</div></div><hr />

I don't buy pets/mounts from the store, since i'm allready paying them. So out of princip i refuse to pay more, even for the &quot;goodies&quot;. <br />
But since all the money goes elsewhere i can consider it, and i'm too lazy to actually donate money. I'm a bad person that consider giving money because i get something on top of it :P</div></div><hr />

Still nothing compared to other tragedies that hit other places than USA. The deaths are one thing but power loss? You could had taken off that part buddy. Nobody cares if you or someone else cant play wow for a couple of hours. USA its not the only place in the world that has issues you know.</div></div><hr />
