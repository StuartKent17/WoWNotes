Arena and Battleground PvP<br />
Drysc made a very long post about the state of PvP in WoW. <br />
It happens, but I'll try to touch upon each of your points and maybe give some small amount of insight and reassurance that they're all points we're either aware of or actively working to resolve.<br />
<br />
Regarding spec viability we would definitely like to see every spec at least partially viable, that doesn't mean however that each spec will be equal in a very cutthroat PvP environment like the arenas. A prot warrior or shadow priest or what have you should though be able to jump into a battleground or arena and be able to do something with some small amount of success. How much success that should be is really the question, but our general philosophy is that we're ok with some specs not being as viable as others, we sort of have to be.<br />
<br />
There's a synergy within the classes for PvP, as well as PvE, that doesn't lend itself to a model where every spec is exactly the same, exactly as viable as the other, in every situation. At that point we start watering down classes, watering down abilities, copy and pasting, the focus of the game is lost, dogs and cats are living together... mass hysteria.<br />
<br />
Moving on to battlegrounds I don't believe we've ever stated that we have fewer maps to keep queue times short, that's not an issue. The issue is the amount of time it takes to create a battleground, and balancing that work time with other areas of the game. Battlegrounds are very labor intensive, Warsong Gulch which is probably the smallest of the battleground maps still has some terrain issues here and there. Playtesting, balancing, making edits, all require a very large amount of resources to ensure a successful battleground.<br />
<br />
Now, that's not to say we aren't willing to put in the time, only that we have an entire game to put resources into, and those resources have to be delegated appropriately. The entire team is now working full force on Wrath of the Lich King, and the new battleground it also includes. Hopefully there will be some time to get additional battleground maps into the mix even after it ships. Personally though I think I'm most excited about Lake Wintergrasp just to see how it turns out.<br />
<br />
In any case I'm sure the people you've been playing with have appreciated your time with them in the game, and I think you'll be pretty excited with the stuff going on in Wrath once we get a bit closer and can start revealing more and more. But I hope you had fun, and see you around maybe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hairstyles and helmet bugs<br />
If you've got an &quot;unusual&quot; hairstyle, you probably had to deal with a few clipping bugs with your helmets. Hortus explains why you might look funny (and bald) with a few of them, at the moment the best way to fix it is to simply hide your helmet. <br />
This is a bug fix to prevent clipping of hair through the front of the helmet. We currently do not have the capability to turn off part of an avatar's hair, it's all or nothing and the item designers make a decision on which one is most attractive to the largest number of hairstyles.<br />
<br />
If your particular hairstyle does not look appropriate with the helmet then I would suggest turning the helmet off in your options menu.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do we have to install so many patches on PTR ?<br />
We're probably reaching the end of the testing phase of Patch 2.4, and PTR newcomers might be a bit scared by the amount of patch they have to download to get their PTR client up to date, Tigerclaw explains why there are so many of them.<br />
<br />
The QA process for a &quot;universal&quot; or one-step patch is much more involved and time consuming than for an incremental patch from version X to X+1. During PTR where we may revise the build one or two times a week, that extra testing time might add more delay than we would like. There is a trade off here - if it gets really out of hand then we might just advise PTR testers to delete their WoWTest folder and we could release a new step-1 patch.<br />
<br />

Vista / WotLK Graphic upgrade<br />
The Expansion is not going to require users to upgrade to Vista. We have some things in the works on the end of graphics, but it's not anything that is going to require this specific upgrade.

<br />
Death Knight unlocking<br />
The thing to keep in mind is that no official information has been provided on how this will work. We don't plan to make it a big hassle as we want everybody to have the option to play the class, but that is all we have stated so far.

We also wouldn't want to squeeze in a new feature like this just to have it. Anything we implement has to meet and satisfy our own standards. We have heard the desire for this feature for players, but for now we will have to wait and see as we have no further details on the topic.

Thats ABSURD .. Why can't you people first finish off what you started with , meaing TBC . Fix it , Balance it , Improve it . Before moving on to the next stage.There's no point in creating expansions when they're not well concidered , created and designed . <br />
<br />
So Blizzard , next stage WOTLK , It isn't balanced and what will you do then ? Tel us to STFU again while your making a new expansion . Like that there will never be balance ...<br />
<br />
My opinion , first make sure TBC is OK . Then move on ...<br />
Althought , right now that is probably to late . When it comes to PVP your MOUNTHS behind on the patching , experimenting and ofcrouse fixing , issues like vanish bug , shadowpriests in general , ect . Should have been taken care of mounths ago (impo a 2 mounths after TBC's release). Servive 0.00 I tell you.</div></div><hr />

lol i felt the same way, if the ENTIRE team is working on WotLK, what is happening with 2.4? is it really that close to done now that it is being sent to the background downloader and the team has moved on? <br />
<br />
perhaps we will see it much sooner than many predicted, although the post about s4 the day before leaves me to believe that is still 4-6 weeks off.</div></div><hr />

&quot;we're working on the expansion so we're not really fixing current stuff&quot;<br />
<br />
It seems to me they are are always working on something else and more and more i feel like im playing a beta.<br />
How many instances arent bugged on release and get fixed only months later? Class issues that last and last.<br />
<br />
I've been saying for almost a year now that they should stop working on things to come for two months and clean up their damn code first.<br />
Every new patch gives old content buggs and they stay bugged.<br />

Forget about making a nostalgia run to do AQ40 or Nax, quite some encounters are fubar.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mazorp</div><div class="date">2008-03-13, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Working on the expansion to fix a large number of issues makes perfect sense. A game is a very technical project and when you start adding, or in the case of WoW users start demanding, features that you never designed for in the first place it becomes real hell. A patch would be WAY to much trouble to make major technical changes with. Expansions allow large code changes, technical feature adjusts, and give you time to see the larger picture. I'm not happy at all with current balance, ask my guildies what I think about my Mage in 2s, but I'm not going to pretend that this can be changed in a split hair. I'm not going to pretend large changes that get suggested are even remotely possible. Being a game developer would not be fun when it comes to balancing, far to much of your player base is ignorant of what all must be changed in the background to make it work. They can't just copy and paste code around or else it gets sloppy and performance both server and client side drops QUICK.<br />
<br />
Then add to the fact that you have people wanting new content and other trying (they're lying) to say &quot;Oh we're fine with content just fix it!&quot; Can't please everyone and the middle ground seems to piss off everyone.</div></div><hr />

Then stop fucking calling it a 'hero class' because if everyone can play it, and it's no more powerful than any other class, then it's not a hero class. It's just a class that is different.</div></div><hr />

When you have the WoW launcher open, click &quot;options&quot; and mark all the 3 options. Then you have the choise of downloading without playing - start the backgrounddownloader from your WoW installation folder. Or while you play as the backgrounddownloader then starts when the launcher detects new patch content.</div></div><hr />

Dear Blizzard,<br />
<br />
My single request to you is as follows. Whenever you see someone make a post saying that your game sucks ass and they are going to quit, please just do us all a favor and instantly ban their account from play. Since they were quitting anyway it won't bother them, since they are just mindless forum trolls you would be better off without them and since the rest of us are sick to death of seeing the same idle threats again and again we would all have a much more enjoyable experience if we never again had to listen to them.<br />
<br />
Thank You.<br />

Not everybody can play it... You need to get to a higher level on another character first and for some people thats hard. Plus I seem to remember thats the only reason its a hero class, on the forums they state that it will be equal in power to other classes, just extremly different... without that annoying releveling =P.

The rest of us will stick around and see how it turns out before we make any judgments, cause every time in the past that we've had major changes like this, they've ended up, oh, you know, NOT RUINING THE GAME! Anyone remember Deathcoil? Locks bitching day in and day out form the time its announced... and now look at it, its one of the keystones of the class. As to the poeple bitching about the comments about specs in PvP... are you really that stupid? Nothing has changed here! Prot has NEVER been viable in PvP. As a matter of fact, the only thing I can see from that statement is GOOD, since they intend to at least try to make it SLIGHTLY viable, which is god damn better than its ever been before.<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucifer Morningstar</div><div class="date">2008-03-13, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok i never usually reply to any threads on any website but the comments i read here were actually quite interesting.<br />
<br />
First of all i just wanna point out that i agree blizzard is not always correct when they modify or change the way a class works , i have heard many people say that they have adapted to the way their class works , and how reducing the range of cyclone for example would heavily damage the way certian people are adapted to react to certain spells.<br />
However , we can't expect &quot; Any &quot; MMORPG game to be perfect. After all it has been designed by humans, and humans make mistakes.<br />
<br />
The thing im trying to say here is that if you have played your favorite class long enough and IF you are experinced enough with it ,you will not actually have any problem with it.<br />
<br />
For example , who said Prot. Warriors are usless in PvP ? i have played my prot warrior in PvP for fun sometimes and i agree that it may sometimes get really owned by &quot; some &quot; classes due to talent specs. But nevertheless , i can easily defeat a rogue or even &quot; almost &quot; any melee class.<br />
<br />
Classes IMO are not supposed to be balanced ! its what makes the game fun , its what makes every Class what it is right now.<br />
If every class was balanced to do the same damage or maintain the same damage taken , what would be the fun of Even playing diffrent classes. <br />
<br />
Every class is Unique in a way or another , but u just need to know When and How to use the skills that you have.<br />
<br />
You all have heard this before but seriously , if your whining about how other classes can easily beat you , u might wanna reconsider getting more Exp. with the class ur playing before you whine about it.<br />
<br />
P.S: Sry if you find spelling mistakes or grammer mistakes , but atleast u might get my point. <br />
Simple : the game shouldn't be balanced cuz its more fun this way where every class is unique in many aspects and not just one.</div></div><hr />

Since they were quitting anyway it won't bother them, since they are just mindless forum trolls you would be better off without them and since the rest of us are sick to death of seeing the same idle threats again and again we would all have a much more enjoyable experience if we never again had to listen to them.<br />
<br />
Thank You.<br />
<br />
P.S. Same message goes to the mmo-champion moderators.<br />

So a paying customer shouldn't have ANY right to criticize or provide feedback on what they paid money for? This is the same demented logic of people who claim that if you don't agree with what the current Bush administration is doing then &quot;GTFO of our country.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well guess what. It's my country too, and this is my game that I play. If Blizzard chooses to ignore all the valid points that we make and stick their heads in the sand, then that's their choice to do so. But we have that freedom to our opinion, just as you have yours.<br />
<br />
Go take a civics class before commenting like that, please.</div></div><hr />

I feel sorry for ppl like this. So consumed by a game they think its &quot;theirs&quot;. Absolutely classic.<br />
<br />
Reality: You bought the game because you liked it and its not reality and you can put it down whenever you want. Or if you bought the game and found out you didn't like it based on what ppl say on this forum you can return it if not opened. Blizzard made the game to make a profit and will only put in enough effort into keeping the majority happy till the return is no longer worth it. No one forced WoW on you and there’s plenty of other mmo's out there for you to get hooked on.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">the_nell_87</div><div class="date">2008-03-13, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">God damn, bitch bitch, bitch, is that all you bastards can do? Every god damn time something changes, all we hear is bitching. You wonder why they don't tell us shit? I don't, its pretty self evident. Seriously, if you hate it that god damn much, leave. The rest of us will stick around and see how it turns out before we make any judgments, cause every time in the past that we've had major changes like this, they've ended up, oh, you know, NOT RUINING THE GAME! Anyone remember Deathcoil? Locks bitching day in and day out form the time its announced... and now look at it, its one of the keystones of the class. As to the poeple bitching about the comments about specs in PvP... are you really that stupid? Nothing has changed here! Prot has NEVER been viable in PvP. As a matter of fact, the only thing I can see from that statement is GOOD, since they intend to at least try to make it SLIGHTLY viable, which is god damn better than its ever been before.<br />
<br />
Anyways, quit the bitching, seriously, cause most of us don't want to hear it and don't care about your shitty, wrong opinions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Totally agreed. Every time any blue says anything, we get pages and pages of posts always looking for the most negative thing possible. According to the forums, 95% of people playing the game are under the serious impression that blizzard hates every single class, and is deliberately trying to annoy their customers.</div></div><hr />

Yes, god forbid we provide comments or feedback on a game that we paid for. <br />
<br />
I won't even bother responding to the rest of your post. From the first line I can already tell that you only read my post with blinders on and read exactly what you wanted to read.</div></div><hr />

You bother to read the agreement when you log in for the first time or any other patch for that matter? You agreed the game was subject to change by clicking ok and when you paid for the game you got what you paid for. So now you think the customer is going to mold the game because they pay a monthly fee, lol! They may take a few suggestions but If you don't like what you see quit.</div></div><hr />

People have a right to express their opinions if you do not like it then don't read forums.<br />
<br />
Like posts claiming others whine while by their own definition they are whining about whining.<br />
<br />
You don't agree that someting is bad?<br />
THen say why instead of acting like some wise ass 11 year old and start a forum argument based on nitpicking on word usage like &quot;my game&quot; while you very well know what he meant. <br />
No offence meant to 11 year olds.</div></div><hr />
