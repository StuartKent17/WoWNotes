<br />
Well the Horde one boils to <br />
<br />
<br />
But she was right.<br />
<br />
A wound that can never heal. That had always been the plan. And Saurfang had failed to inflict it.<br />
<br />
The story of Malfurion’s miraculous survival would have spread among the armies of the Alliance as proof that they were blessed in their cause.<br />
<br />
War would still have come. That had been certain the moment Saurfang had led the Horde into Ashenvale. And it would have been what he had feared most: the meat grinder, spending so many lives<br />
<br />
to achieve so little, ending with a whimper, and thus dooming future generations to a war nobody could win. Once again, Sylvanas had seen it before he had.<br />
<br />
And so . . .<br />
<br />
She had sent a message. This was not a war that would end in a stalemate. Not now. The Alliance and the Horde would both understand that the only choices were victory or death. Lok‐tar ogar.<br />
<br />
So she will be still condemned by Tauren and some orcs, as well as entirety of Horde druids and player characters who rp as honorforbrains savages. But the rest of the Horde doesn't care that much, at least not much enough to rebel.<br />
<br />
All Horde leaders apart from Baine were informed about starting war and attacking Teldrassil, and had no problems with being agressors. Bain somehow knew about it but didn't do anything as usual.<br />
<br />
Apart from OG Thrall Horde, the other races joined horde to break Status Quo, to change the disposition of powers and rise up even at the cost of other nations. Sylvanas makes Status Quo impossible to maintain by creating an event so resonating, that &quot; This was not a war that would end in a stalemate. Not now. The Alliance and the Horde would both understand that the only choices were victory or death.&quot;</div></div><hr />

You mean how she did Thrall well because he was meant to be written as a human, but then went and wrote other Orc stories and wrote the main characters of those: Durotan and Doomhammer, also as human, forgetting that Thrall was like that because he was raised by them and was often stated to not be a true Orc because of it? How any Orc that doesn't act like Thrall, or any none-human in general, is typically instead written in a negative light and/or just acts like a modern day human like Tyrande in War Crimes where she turns into a modern day attorney?</div></div><hr />

I think they are forgetting Twilight is considered a Best Seller too. <br />
And 50 Shades of Grey iirc. <br />
<br />
Getting &quot;Best Seller&quot; status definitely doesn't mean you write well. <br />
It just means your work is successful. <br />

That isn't saying much. Being better than garbage isn't a major accomplishment. <br />
<br />
What about the writer for Illidan, William King? Micky Nielson (Ashbringer, Blood of the Highborne)? Matt Burns (The Jade Hunters, Bleeding Sun)? <br />
<br />
She is low on the list of even Warcraft writers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure just playing War of Thorns and Battle for Undercity will give you most of what you need to understand it. These novellas are just more in-depth retellings of the Horde and Alliance questlines.<br />
<br />
Most likely all three Warbringers shorts will be viewable in-game somehow, just like the Harbingers ones were in Legion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Old Soldier&quot; will probably play in-game before the Battle for Lordaeron for Horde players.<br />
<br />
So that just leaves the comics, which aren't super important in the grand scheme of things, and Before the Storm, which is important but will likely be summarized in-game if anything directly related to it crops up.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, most of this stuff is made available to us for free anyway. The only thing you'd have to buy is the book.<br />

Mia understood better than most how much her decision to stay in Stormwind had cost the<br />

in Stormwind. With the assurance that Stormwind guards would arrive shortly with food and<br />

<br />
Popularity is a good indicator of how well-received someone's work is. If the author is a NY Times Best Seller, I'm sure they didn't get there by being shit. If popularity isn't a reflection of skill, but you mentioned the difference is that this person is a paid writer, then wouldn't someone who is paid to write be someone who possesses a certain amount of skill in the field? Like say... enough skill in the field to get paid for it? I didn't think I had to make the argument this clear for you to get what I was saying, but here I am having to lay it out for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They state several times that people can only go 2-3 at a time through the portals. Ostensibly, there were people who got through while Genn was lifting the stones off Mia. The reason they don't specifically say that is that Genn's entire focus is on Mia and Astarii, and that particular part is told primarily from his point of view.</div></div><hr />

because fire and smoke was pouring out of it. i swear, you folks have some legitimate reading comprehension problems. they're all in the mage tower by the mage holding open the last portal and it's causing the whole area to be hot and smokey and that type of fire is almost alive, they noticed that it wasn't normal fire, it could leap through the portal and set part of SW on fire.</div></div><hr />

Ostensibly, there were people who got through while Genn was lifting the stones off Mia. The reason they don't specifically say that is that Genn's entire focus is on Mia and Astarii, and that particular part is told primarily from his point of view.<br />
<br />
They thought the city was on fire, not the whole world tree.<br />
<br />
Very different scenarios.</div></div><hr />

Sylvanas motives are much clearer now, plus Saurfang realises, that it was his fault, that Darnassus has to be burned, which makes his suicied-mission in the GCI-movie much more plausible.</div></div><hr />

If only Saurfang had more in him to see this through to the end, instead of squatting in the Stockades</div></div><hr />

Agreed. What is the point of CE now? Big box?</div></div><hr />

Did you honestly think no one would scan these and post them for free?<br />
So it came from Blizzard...who cares?...we were going to read them regardless</div></div><hr />

You get a hardbook cover aswell as the illustrations and I'd much rather have those than just a .pdf</div></div><hr />

Both give some real perspective. Great to see so many people getting emotionally involved in the lore storyline (even when that emotion is denial/rejection), haven't seen that for a long time in Warcraft.<br />
<br />
I hope the story unfolds to have the reactions of the Horde Paladins and Druids at later points, though those chapters of the story are clearly going to be gated to patch content, so if it happens it'll be a long time until we see it.<br />
<br />
Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem challenging Sylvannus to a mak'gora would be great to see.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. But I just KNOW there are going to be a bunch of people who will say it's free because of backlash, despite the fact we knew they would be months ago.</div></div><hr />

TL;DR: (and with minimum spoilers)<br />
The author of &quot;A good war&quot; has Sylvanas Windrunner brilliantly explain in the first chapters all the reasons why Warbinger Sylvanas is and idiotic war criminal. <br />
Genn Greymane also explains why Sylvanas shot herself in the foot by killing Darnassus civilians. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Both were good reads, i recommend them. They further pissed me off about the Darkshore idiotic aftermath</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorrowseer</div><div class="date">2018-08-07, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So it says the mental gymnastics that the warchief went through to justify this war and they speculated what would happen if they didn't, as for what they did speculate on what would happen if they won this way, was pretty stupid, erg painful to read.<br />
<br />
More tentative references to Sylvanas having an ultimate nerfarious and unspoken goal in mind also.</div></div><hr />

The same thing it’s always been: a big box full of fancy, physical nonsense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Why? what Sylvanas did was the definition of genocide .<br />
<br />
gen·o·cide<br />
ˈjenəˌsīd/Submit<br />
noun<br />
the deliberate killing of a large group of people, especially those of a particular ethnic group or nation.<br />
<br />
The killing was deliberate : check<br />
<br />
Large group of people : check<br />
<br />
Particular group or nation : check</div></div><hr />

These novellas are just more in-depth retellings of the Horde and Alliance questlines.<br />
<br />
Most likely all three Warbringers shorts will be viewable in-game somehow, just like the Harbingers ones were in Legion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Old Soldier&quot; will probably play in-game before the Battle for Lordaeron for Horde players.<br />
<br />
So that just leaves the comics, which aren't super important in the grand scheme of things, and Before the Storm, which is important but will likely be summarized in-game if anything directly related to it crops up.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, most of this stuff is made available to us for free anyway. The only thing you'd have to buy is the book.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, that's what they always said. Did you not read the descriptions of the things you are buying?<br />
<br />
No I knew that there wont be an artbook in the CE and i Knew that it was a Storybook. But It feels kinda.. not that special or Collectors Edition worthy anymore if they swap out the artbook with 2 novels that they release beforehand anyways. I was bumbed out from the start that this time there is no Arbook, but to have it replaced by just a nicer print of an online for-free available PDF ? .. Thats a bit absurd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you that the replacement of the artbook with the novellas is disappointing. As a whole this new CE was a disappointment to me and has pushed me to make the decision to stop collecting them altogether, because I have no interest in a $40 shelf ornament and mainly collected them for the artbooks and BTS DVDs.<br />
<br />
However, it was stated from the start that the novellas would be made available online, sans illustrations.</div></div><hr />

Well before that fancy physical stuff was better. I don't like that it is mostly digital, and I have no need for alliance symbol ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don’t like it, the response is not to buy it! Hooray, saving like fifty bucks!<br />
<br />
Look, I like the old ones better too, but this one isn’t somehow devalued because the text of the fancy coffee table book is available online.</div></div><hr />

Well IMO it is devalued. Yeah saving money is fine I guess, since mounts aren't that amazing I want them (like legion mount), what really made me buy other CE was that collectors quality of art-book, soundtrack on a cd and mousepad (I know not best quality but still). I guess it is time to stop :)</div></div><hr />

Interestingly enough, after doing the questline I imagined just that, my pristess (Draenei), burned in sooth &amp; blood covered clothing holding an unconscious Nightelf child in her arms when she stepped through the portal to follow Genn.</div></div><hr />
