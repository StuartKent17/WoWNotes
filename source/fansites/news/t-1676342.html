This was working as intended since its launch. In fact, it was implemented in beta:<br />
http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4169-Warlords-of-Draenor-Beta-Build-18566<br />
The patch will just update the tooltip to reflect the change.</div></div><hr />

Seconded. <br />

Hell, you don't even need to do that, anyone who did any modicum of reading on the hotfixes for the past few weeks would have been aware that 6.1 would be fixing the metric ton of tooltip dissonance from all the recent hotfixes. ¬_¬</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is clearly an error in it's entirety, since neither Inner Fire nor Inner Will exists since 6.0. A monkey has been drunk somewhere, adding this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seeing as MSAA in a Deferred engine isn't really MSAA at all ...it's a small subset of it since a large part of the MSAA rendering pipeline simply cannot work with a deferred engine. So they cludge it and get parts of it working, even then DX10 is required for it to function at all in its cludge state. Its Horribly inefficient on a deferred engine compared to say SSAA or compared to full MSAA on a non deferred engine. Still its there for them that wish to waste their video process power on a horrible implementation of MSAA.</div></div><hr />

Yes I completely agree about it being inefficient and I won't be using it. I just have an issue with the word 'impossible'. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't since Full MSAA is impossible, call it MSAA if you want but its not even close to actually being that, even at 8x it wont have the clarity or sharpness on a deferred engine that it used to have before WoD.<br />
<br />
I don't know why they kept the MSAA tag for it when they cludged it working in DX10, should have called it something else to avoid people thinking its the same thing.</div></div><hr />

I've expected that too. We killed two of the 6 enemy Warlords so far:<br />
<br />
- Ner'Zhul (already killable in the Shadowmoon Burial Grounds).<br />
- Kargath (already killable in Highmaul).<br />
- Blackhand (next to follow in Blackrock Foundry in 6.1).<br />
- Kilrogg (in a dungeon or raid in 6.2 or 6.3).<br />
- Gul'dan (probably at the end of the Legendary questline, and I hope it's fight is as difficult as Kanrethad's).<br />
- Grommash (Warlords final boss in Tanaan in 6.3 or 6.4).</div></div><hr />

Kind of has that feeling at the moment, especially with the Blackrock Cache coming in 6.1<br />
If that's so that would mean we could expect 6.1 around February. <br />

I guess you ignored the spoilers here about the new Void area hub, which is likely to be in the same vein as Isle of Giants.<br />
<br />
But you'll probably complain there isn't anything to do while sitting in your Garrison and a laundry list of content you've never ever touched since launch.</div></div><hr />

It is currently bad. It gives us eye-cancer. The flickering, the horrible texture-edges. Glad that Blizzard did return some AA-settings and introducing SuperSampling to the game.</div></div><hr />

nice content patch blizz, makes me wonder what you people are smoking up there in irvine CA<br />
<br />
Patches that end in an even number are major content patches. Odd are transition patches. 5.6=SoO,5.5=the daily stuff in the barrens before SoO.<br />
<br />
6.0=launch, Highmaul, Blackrock, 6.1= transition+major system/class updates before next content patch.</div></div><hr />

SSAAx2 is best, but its rough on a lot of GPU's, it basicly renders the game at twice your resolution then squeezes down to match your resolution. Unless you have a GTX 760 / R9 270X or better you might suffer harsh FPS loss using it at 1080P+</div></div><hr />

I like the current Garrison music on both factions. However, I find it great that we might be able to customize it. That, along with being able to use racial (or Ebon Blade) guards helps a lot in alleviating that &quot;ORC ORC ORC HUMAN HUMAN HUMAN&quot; feel that Garrisons have. If only we could pick racial architecture too...</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are &quot;new&quot; methods for implementing antialiasing (eg smoothening out of pixels). At WoD launch, MSAA was removed and replaced with a much worse option called CMAA, but now we're getting some good options back.</div></div><hr />

(for stupid people like me ofc)<br />
Thanks!<br />
MSAA stands for multi-sample anti-aliasing, it sets 2, 4 or 8 sample points per pixel where it'll try to smoothen jagged lines by kind of &quot;blending&quot; the colors at those sample points. This is what we had before Warlods of Draenor. Example (http://images.anandtech.com/doci/4061/EQAA.png)<br />
SSAA means Supersample anti-aliasing and from my understanding, it basically renders the game at a higher resolution and then scales it down which somehow works to smoothen jaggies. It's pretty heavy but the results are usually good.<br />
CMAA is the post-processing anti-aliasing option introduced in Warlords and usable in DX11 only. The way I understand it, it's a sort of filter that tries to smoothen jaggies, and it's around equivalent to 2x MSAA.</div></div><hr />

•The new quests in Patch 6.1 take place at the Iron Docks<br />
<br />
We'll have to see what exactly that entails, but it might be a new daily quest area. Most non-raid patches don't have new zones, they normally have remakes of current zones. 5.1 remade Krasarang and 5.3 had that Barrens thing.<br />
<br />
For those wondering why it would be in the Iron Docks area of Gorgrond, chapter III of the legendary quest's description is &quot;complete the legendary quests in BRF until the Iron Horde is on the run&quot; so if that is a daily quest zone, it fits with chapter III.</div></div><hr />

yeah a GTX 760 will do SSAAx2 fine just keep the game on good to high with setting like shadows on low and for the love of saving the frames turn off SSAO, that setting is botched to all hell in wow and saps away power for no real visual gain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, 6.1 was never meant or talked about as a big, new content patch. 6.1 brings some additional stuff for garrisions (improving them), some stalled changes that didn't make it too the 6.0 patch like heirlooms and belf models. Also they add some new items, correct many things in terms of translation they had to hotfix with the start of WoD etc.<br />
<br />
Also I don't think that's all the changes there are to come, still some time till the 6.1 release. Usually it's Content Patch, Smaller Hotfixes, Big Hotfix/Cleaning Patch, New Contant Patch and so on.<br />
<br />
And don't worry - they have seperate teams, that means the new raid tier or whatever is still being worked on with full speed, while the others do the secondary stuff like garrisions, transitems etc.</div></div><hr />

Thanks master! In the meantime try to realize the simple fact: 99% of this datamined patchnotes is close to nothing.....tooltip fixes? Supposed to be done on the fly. Some new content? Please point out the some part...this is not a major patch in ANY game since late 90`s, this is nothing,a joke and kinda bad one.</div></div><hr />

I'll send this to you via PM too, but just FYI ... you can get that message just because your drivers are too far out of date. Obviously that's a cheap (free) and easy fix. Anyway, it's something you might want to double check (assuming you haven't already) before you give up hope. Good luck!</div></div><hr />
