Patch 5.4 Feature Preview: Connected Realms<br />
Over the years, World of Warcraft players of all kinds have naturally migrated to different realms to play with their friends, find new guilds, strive for Heroic boss kills, search for the most competitive PvP experiences, and otherwise try to find the right place to call home. Over time, these shifts in player population can sometimes create a less-than-optimal play experience for those on less popular realms, making it tougher to find guilds, conquer group content, and get what they’re looking for from the Auction House and in-game economy.<br />
<br />
In Patch 5.4, we’re looking to address this with a new feature called Connected Realms. Building on our existing cross-realm technology, a Connected Realm is a set of two or more standard realms that have been permanently and seamless “linked.” These linked realms will behave as if they were one cohesive realm, meaning you’ll be able to join the same guilds and Arena teams, access a single Auction House, run the same Raids and Dungeons, and join other adventurers to complete quests.<br />
<br />
Our goal with Connected Realms is to give players on lower-population realms more opportunities to group up, compete, and connect with other players to take on Azeroth’s bigger challenges. That sort of interaction is a big part of what makes World of Warcraft fun, and this feature will help us deliver that experience to even more players.<br />
<br />
We’ve prepared a short FAQ to answer a few questions we’re sure you’ll have, and we’re very eager to hear your thoughts and collect further questions in your comments below.<br />
<br />
Q. Why are you implementing Connected Realms?<br />
A.As WoW has evolved, we’ve seen players naturally gravitate toward a subset of very active realms, leaving behind lower-populated realms. Due to the massively multiplayer nature of World of Warcraft, certain kinds of gameplay experiences simply aren’t well-suited to a low-pop realm. By allowing players from two or more lower-pop realms to play together, we hope to give more players more opportunities to participate in group-oriented activities, helping to foster a more vibrant in-game community.<br />
<br />
Connected Realms also allow us to link populations in a way that’s not disruptive to players, and that doesn’t negatively impact players’ sense of identity and character. Other alternatives such as merging realms would require us to force character name changes if there were conflicts, and could lead to confusion for returning players who’d log in to find their realm missing from the realm list. Some players also feel strong ties to their realm’s name or history, and we don’t want to erase that.<br />
<br />
Q. Why implement this now?<br />
A. Our cross-realm technology has continued to evolve since it was first developed for joining players in dungeons. It’s now at a point where we can create seamless worlds made up of multiple individual realms, and we think there are some really positive benefits to that.<br />
<br />
Q. How can I tell if someone is on my Connected Realm, but from a different realm?<br />
A. Similar to how we use the (*) symbol next to a player’s name to denote if they’re from another realm in Raid Finder, Dungeons, Scenarios, or a cross-realm zone, we’ll be using a (#) symbol to indicate that someone is part of your Connected Realm, but not your home realm.<br />
<br />
Q. Which realms will be connected as Connected Realms?<br />
A. We haven’t decided yet which realms will be made part of a Connected Realm, or which other realms they’ll be connected to, though realms will only be connected to other realms of the same type (e.g. PvE to PvE, PvP to PvP, RP to RP). In the end, we’re considering a number of factors, including Battlegroup, population, and faction balance.<br />
<br />
Q. How many realms will make up a Connected Realm?<br />
A. We don’t know how many realms will make up a Connected Realm yet, and it’s likely to differ from Connected Realm to Connected Realm. Our goal is to create a vibrant and fun online experience where you can join guilds, access an active Auction House, and band together to take on group content.<br />
<br />
Q. Will Connected Realms have any limitations?<br />
A. There should be no limitations. We want the experience to be seamless, and we expect it work as if you’re suddenly part of a much more active realm.<br />
<br />
Q. When will Connected Realms be available?<br />
A. We haven’t yet determined when we’ll be creating the first Connected Realms, but we expect it will be some time after the launch of Patch 5.4.</div></div><hr />

hey blizzard you fools should have done this YEARS AGO. except ACTUAILLY MERGE REALMS instead of waiting for &quot;new technology&quot; to do it you know... back when you started hemorraging subs because people diddnt want to pay to play on a server thats not stupid dead? yeah...</div></div><hr />

Those are by far the worst people to play with, as they don't understand how to play. The worse LFR/LFD groups I have been in have been with these groups, and I'm not the only one who feels this way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, like they said above, if they merged the realms, lets say they merged Ysera and Malfurion, one of those names would have to go. If they chose Malfurion, then people who were attached to that realm name can't have it anymore. And they would have to force name changes onto people, because you can't have two of the same name on a realm. <br />
<br />
If they just connect them, then instead of meshing them together into one, theyre, well, connected. It's Ysera and Malfurion, instead of just Ysera with Malfurion players. <br />
And you get to keep your name :D<br />
<br />
It's a subtle, yet huge difference.</div></div><hr />

While I'm relieved to see they will only merge realms of the same type, a couple of things still concern me. Will heirlooms be cross-connected-realm (as seems to be the case), would like a confirmation on this. <br />
<br />
<br />
We haven’t yet determined when we’ll be creating the first Connected Realms, but we expect it will be some time after the launch of Patch 5.4.<br />
<br />
This annoys me quite a bit. For me, connected realms are the thing I'm looking forward to most out of the announced features, and it worries me that it might still take a lóng time after the 5.4 release before it's applied to all realms. The dying/empty realms issue is one of the main things that is putting me off WoW at the moment.<br />
<br />
Overall I find the post to be pretty vague, and I'm hoping some more information will come our way soon.</div></div><hr />

A. We haven’t yet determined when we’ll be creating the first Connected Realms, but we expect it will be some time after the launch of Patch 5.4.<br />
<br />
They really shouldn't call this a &quot;Patch 5.4 Feature&quot; if it's not going live with Patch 5.4. They really should word their title better, unless this is something they can modify without patches, and they'll slowly be creating new &quot;server clusters&quot; throughout 5.4. Lot of people believe this is happening when 5.4 releases, and that doesn't seem to be the case.<br />
<br />
<br />
I prefer this to crz and i'm actually kind of excited to see this happen. Hopefully they release a list of connected realms sometime soon if possible so we know whats connected to what.<br />
<br />
CRZ will still exist pretty sure, those CRZ zones could be even more populated after this depending on how they choose which servers to merge.</div></div><hr />

You definitely can, the AH and economy are connected as well as guilds. It wouldn't make sense for you not to be able to mail items to people on other realms in your cluster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fully agree with this, gotta admit I'm kind of disappointed this won't ship with 5.4. I think this feature is something a lot of people are waiting for, especially people from the lower populated realms. Not to mention a connected realm will, in a way, give you 11 additional character slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you really think your capability to play is directly related to which language you speak? Should I start learning finnish then?<br />
<br />
No, back when I was raiding in WotLK, we had a group of 3 people that were running random heroics after raids, always having some 2 random people in the group. Yes, we could be dicks sometimes, speaking Czech in the party chat, because it was easier than to 3-way whisper (there were no chat conference conversation back then) but we were always perfect game-wise. There have to be hardcore raid guilds on Ragnaros too and those players are certainly good in LFD/LFR. You only notice the bad ones because that's what you're focusing on and that's where you're basing a correlation on an anecdotal evidence.</div></div><hr />

I'll believe it when I see it. I've played so many MMOs now that were supposed to be awesome but flopped or fell short in the end. I think GW2 was a good game, especially for F2P, but the story or lack thereof just couldn't hold my attention for me to keep playing it. Same with TERA, back when I was still paying a subscription. Love SWTOR for the story, but hate the end game. FF14 was originally a mess, but I'm still planning to get 2.0 - didn't think it was the greatest game from playing the new beta, but it was a decent change from WoW. And of course, even WoW has its own issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep. I know you're being sarcastic, but that is completely correct. Sub losses effect individual servers much less then people make out.<br />

I refuse to use characters with the silly symbols that make sending tells a pain, and unfortunately whoever has the name I want on my server still has an active subscription somewhere (not sure if they're even on my server, but it's been over a year and the name has never showed up on the Armory), so the GMs won't relinquish it to me. :(<br />
<br />
If the person created the character and never, ever logged in as that character, the name will be taken but never show in the list on the armory. That could likely be what this person has done with your desired name.</div></div><hr />

You're right, but people have been leaving medium/low pop servers for high pop servers for a while now. That and subs being down are the reasons why some servers look like ghost towns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Decreased subscriptions is certainly a factor, and not shocking at all with the wait between each patch and the staleness of MoP... if I wasn't still raiding, I'd probably have quit a long time ago. I log in now to raid and then log off immediately after.<br />
<br />
But I know on my server, nearly every major progressive raiding guild transferred off to some popular server that everyone else was going to. My guild shot up to number one on the server for a while since all the competition left.</div></div><hr />

Not sure how you deduce all that from Connected Realms. We've known for a while that this was coming and we know that 5.5 has always been possible, just that there would be no raids IF it did happen.</div></div><hr />

I've played so many MMOs now that were supposed to be awesome but flopped or fell short in the end. I think GW2 was a good game, especially for F2P, but the story or lack thereof just couldn't hold my attention for me to keep playing it. Same with TERA, back when I was still paying a subscription. Love SWTOR for the story, but hate the end game. FF14 was originally a mess, but I'm still planning to get 2.0 - didn't think it was the greatest game from playing the new beta, but it was a decent change from WoW. And of course, even WoW has its own issues.<br />
I played EQ and EQ2 and really look forward to something from the EQ universe again. EQ was a brilliant game and I find myself wishing each mmo I play had some of the basic concepts they used back then. I've started believing in the FTP platform now more than ever, after leaving wow to play things like Neverwinter, Rift when it went ftp when I think about how fun those games can be and not cost a dime of your money. It just makes me angry knowing I spent so many years in wow, not happy when I could have been trying other things. They've had the corner on the market long enough, I hope they hurt maybe they'll continue to improve the game for the games sake and not for their pocketbook.<br />
<br />
I wish I could be impressed by FF14, I have yet to get into it, wildstar was a lot more fun between both betas...</div></div><hr />

The worse LFR/LFD groups I have been in have been with these groups, and I'm not the only one who feels this way.<br />
<br />
This is a generalization about Spanish people or Spanish speaking people and is verging on racism by saying they can not play. If you had claimed it was tough because of a language barrier then it would be a reasonable statement but as it stands it is quite offensive.<br />

Right, I'd imagine it would be a difficult proposition to start unlinking these things after it's gone live. That's why I'd rather them do what it takes to get them right before rolling it out.</div></div><hr />

They don't have to say it's server merging because just reading the method they are using is saying the game is losing population slowly.

They've explained this. The mail system is so heavly encoded into the core of the games systems, that when they start makeing changes other things just start falling apart. I assume work on such a system is thus very slow going</div></div><hr />

Questions:<br />
<br />
1. If you have 2 or more realms connected that means you are getting another 11 character slots per those realms, right? So you could have 22, 33, etc. to work with on the realm you play.<br />
2. BoA items should be mailable if you created toons on each of the connected realms since the economy, ah, etc. are all linked. Or am I missing something?<br />
3. Are they only merging low-pop realms. Mine is considered medium population but the activity is more on par with low pop realms. It is dead. Hopefully we get at least one other realm merged with ours.<br />
4. Is this in essence a &quot;forever&quot; merger? If you can have guildies and things like that b/c they are merged but on different servers then &quot;un-merging&quot; would remove those members of your guild. Seems like it would have to be a permanent link b/t the servers they choose to merge with each other.<br />
<br />
Exciting though. I hope this works like they say it will.</div></div><hr />

No reason for me to resub untill that feature is on live servers. My realm is dead, all guilds which raided left during the 50% promotion.

<br />
or maybe they are doing it this way to avoid thousands of people being forced to change character names and the drama that would unfold surrounding who gets what name? As well as what to do with the multitude of inactive characters associated with each realm, allowing them to avoid a Age of conan style deletion of characters that are innactive.<br />

<br />
1. Implement a surname system like many other games have. This would allow you to keep your current name, and even spice it up a bit more. Give people a week to choose new names.<br />
2. Begin server merging process. Select one medium population realm and several low ones.<br />
3. Disallow new AH posts and new mail on the low population realms for a period of 3-7 days, letting people on that realm know they must empty the AH and mailbox before merges<br />
4. At the end of that period, merge the low population realms into the medium one. Doing it this way will allow for less guild name clashes.<br />
5. In the event of a duplicate guild name, the guild with more members will win the rights to the name. The other will receive a free guild name change.<br />
<br />
So there's no real point in using fancy terms like &quot;connected&quot; realms. Just merge the damn things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Questions:<br />
<br />
1. If you have 2 or more realms connected that means you are getting another 11 character slots per those realms, right? So you could have 22, 33, etc. to work with on the realm you play.<br />
<br />
That'd be cool, allow me to start doing alliance toons on the same &quot;server&quot; too...<br />
<br />
<br />
2. BoA items should be mailable if you created toons on each of the connected realms since the economy, ah, etc. are all linked. Or am I missing something?<br />
3. Are they only merging low-pop realms. Mine is considered medium population but the activity is more on par with low pop realms. It is dead. Hopefully we get at least one other realm merged with ours.<br />
<br />
On mine, the Alliance side is very healthy, the Horde side is very dead... Our server is considered &quot;medium&quot; but... Horde is Low Pop easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Is this in essence a &quot;forever&quot; merger? If you can have guildies and things like that b/c they are merged but on different servers then &quot;un-merging&quot; would remove those members of your guild. Seems like it would have to be a permanent link b/t the servers they choose to merge with each other.<br />

1. The names aren't merging. You can still have 11 slots on Windrunner and 11 slots on Wyrmrest if they merge those two (or more) together; you just get lucky with having 22 that can mail each other items. Still limited to 50 total chars or however many it is.<br />
2. You can mail BOA to same linked server. If you couldn't then you couldn't mail items to guildies on same linked server either -- wouldn't make sense. You likely still cant mail them cross server until they figure out something else with that.<br />
3. Probably merging anything medium or lower with others to create high-pops. Seems like the purpose is to get pools of people together, with a side benefit of server balancing if possible. High-pop one-sided servers may still be in trouble. Your guess as good as mine though.<br />
4. Besides the word &quot;permanently&quot; in the description yes it will be a forever merger unless new tech/paradigm came out. You cant expect to join a guild and then unmerge and not have access to guildies or guild bank, amongst other logistic issues.</div></div><hr />

hey blizzard you fools should have done this YEARS AGO. except ACTUAILLY MERGE REALMS instead of waiting for &quot;new technology&quot; to do it you know... back when you started hemorraging subs because people diddnt want to pay to play on a server thats not stupid dead? yeah...<br />
<br />
Did you bother to actually read ?<br />
This avoids name clashes, and being non-permanant allows them to be shuffled around again should a faction representation or population go screwy.<br />
A big assumption that the low population realms were THE primary reason people left.<br />
<br />
<br />
What about bind on account items?<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, connected realms should effectively function as one, allowing mail to be sent between those characters whichever traditional realm they came from.<br />
Therefore if your characters on separate traditional realms form part of the same connected realm, then mailing items between them should be possible.<br />
Given how interaction like auction houses, guilds etc are intended to be possible, it makes sense for mail to be included and I would say pretty essential that it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
is this the &quot;we dont wanna overhype it&quot; 5.4 feature they kept secret?<br />
<br />
Blizzard hinted there were many big features in 5.4, and you could pick and choose your favourite.<br />
<br />
I would say that Connected Realms, Flex Raiding, Proving Grounds and the Arena Team changes are the bigger changes coming with the patch.<br />

What about people who are purposefully on a low pop realm because they like it but might want some opportunities to do specific group activities?

<br />
Will connected Realms share 'realm population', or ever be split apart if one realm gets too large?<br />
<br />
Virutal Realm will have no population limit (this is not a merge). Each individual server will have population limit (aka log in queues).<br />
<br />
Short answer is no, the connected realms will never be split apart because of population issues.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ecwfrk</div><div class="date">2013-08-05, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For low population servers, this might be a good idea, for everyone else it's just further destroying the community.<br />
<br />
For &quot;everyone else&quot; it's presumably irrelevant as it should only affect the low pop servers that are already lacking in community. Of course, if this complaint is based on the same logic as the &quot;I don't like LFR but those who do like it enjoying it destroys the game!!!&quot; complaints then yes, this will horribly and irrevocably destroy something; just like every other thing they don't like/care about/want/need does. <br />
<br />
For those on low pop realms that have been wanting a solution other than dropping $25 for each character they have, this will will be great. For those on realms with an already healthy population, it will be meaningless as those realms are unlikely to be connected to other realms.<br />
Other than the previously mentioned illogical complainers, the only ones who don't seem like they'll get much from this is those on high pop realms who are on the wrong side of a massive faction imbalance that makes it feel like a low pop realm. Only those who want to be on a low pop realm have anything to complain about because they're gonna be screwed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Short answer is no, the connected realms will never be split apart because of population issues.<br />
<br />
I doubt that's entirely true. This is a server merge. People from more than one server will now be sharing the same space. They could also say they're merging servers, giving each player the surname of their former server, but only making the surnames visible to people with a different surname. It's just PR semantics. <br />
<br />
5000 people in Vale of Eternal Blossoms will still cause performance issues for the players there no matter what virtual realm they rolled their character on. Population limits are implemented for performance reasons. So it's likely connected servers will have a shared queue. Although they'll likely connect servers so that it would take a massive population explosion in one or more of the connected realms for queues to ever be necessary. So shared queues or splits should be highly unlikely, but not unlikely enough to say they'll never happen. I wouldn't be totally surprised to one day see an offer for free transfers from one connected cluster to another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, cause that's the whole goal of this, to give high pop realms large queue times...<br />
<br />
<br />
I suppose this method, as apposed to merging the realms would allow blizz (should they ver need to) un-link the realms back into single ones again, or if population decreases further, add more into the mixup.<br />
<br />
At the touch of a button the can theoretically combine or split as many as they like without ever having to worry about identity and naming consequences.<br />

The worse LFR/LFD groups I have been in have been with these groups, and I'm not the only one who feels this way.<br />
<br />
I played on a Spanish server (long story) but what I saw there was if I was with a Spanish speaking friend in a group and they spoke at all (in Spanish), they would be kicked immediately, but if I ended up in a group with only other Spanish speaking players and said I didn't speak Spanish, they would go out of their way to accommodate me....just saying...</div></div><hr />

These have ALL been CRZed since their inception. Even large servers get CRZed. When I run around I see Illidan (one of the biggest horde PvP servers), Sargeras (one of the biggest alliance PvP servers), and a number of medium and small servers. Obviously, they would not &quot;server merge&quot; all of these, but they are melded with CRZ.<br />
<br />
But all cata zones, all northrend zones, have been CRZ. You lost your chance at these things when CRZ rolled out.</div></div><hr />

My server is DEAD...there are often not more than 10(!!!!) players online(funny fact is that the server shows as &quot;middle&quot; at the very same time. Yeah, whoever they want to fool.)...if they would merge my entire server pool it would likely not be a halfway full server. Now if you start merging with the idea in mind &quot;let's not merge too many cause we can't go back again&quot;...then you can imagine that we are likely at least a year away from having a halfway decent playing experience...and by that time the subscriptions on our server will likely decrease by another 50% due to frustration. I'm afraid the merged servers will die faster than they will be merged....<br />
<br />
I mean, look at it....it was scheduled for 5.4. Now it's already somewhere after 5.4....next time we hear about it it's likely christmas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, it's a good change. I just don't see the difference between 'connected' and 'merged', looking at the description.<br />
<br />
they answered this directly. 1. they don´t want to force name changes and guild name changes and 2. They don´t want returning players to be confused if their realm is suddenly missing.<br />
<br />
I know tin-foil hat people won´t buy it, but they are two very valid reasons. Also, Blizzard announces their subscription numbers every 3 months. They aren´t hiding anything just because they chose this technology rather than a straight merger. If they were being sneaky at all, then we wouldn´t get subscription numbers every 3 months from them. Server mergers in other games have been messy mainly because of guild names and stuff like that, there are always people who are angered.. this solves that.</div></div><hr />

Makes more competition on the server for both factions for raiding and server firsts. Servers get boring when there is only 1 good guild that gets the servers first, make them work against other guilds as good. They already said in the blue post that faction balance is one reason they're doing this...or did you not even read the post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hey blizzard you fools should have done this YEARS AGO. except ACTUAILLY MERGE REALMS instead of waiting for &quot;new technology&quot; to do it you know... back when you started hemorraging subs because people diddnt want to pay to play on a server thats not stupid dead? yeah...<br />
<br />
<br />
They announce their subscription numbers every 3 months. They haven´t avoided any ´bad PR´.. people know exactly what is going on. They also announce their revenues every 3 months, which are higher now than they were last year.... so good luck with trying to prove your ´hemorraging (sic) theory.<br />
<br />
The new technology started with LFD, then went to LFR, then went to CRZ.. this is just a natural progression to that. If you don´t see this as new technology, great... show me another MMO that has any type of cross-server LFD system.<br />
<br />
The problem with low-population servers started back right before BC was launched. About a month before BC, they added about 15% more server to NA and EU, and stupidly, they made many of them PVP. They overestimated the growth rate of the game based on what it had been doing in Vanilla, and I think they also overestimated the number of players who would start over on a new realm. In Vanilla, whenever a new server opened, a TON of people would start over on that server. Once we got into BC, there just were not as many people willing to completely start over because most of us had a ton of developed alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There were some datamined strings about a month ago that indicated you would be able to mail stuff to connected realms.<br />
<br />
Also, technologically it seems they almost have to do it because of the AH. If the AH is connected, then basically you are mailing a sold item to a person on a different server. On the string thing, I believe you will type in something like this Azrile#Shadowmourne which would send an email to Azrile on the Shadowmourne server.<br />

I know everyone wants everything sooner, rather than later, but the fact remains that it is coming. I'd rather them take their time and try to get it right. You'd be more pissed off if they pushed it out and messed up the one feature you're looking forward to.<br />
<br />
Yeah, this is a bit like CRZ.. it is a huge tech change.. they probably don´t want any bugs to be muddled into the other bugs that come with 5.4 They probably want to have 5.4 content very stable and THEN be able to implement this slowly. One of the reasons CRZ wasn´t liked was because it came with MoP and the bugs weren´t fixed quickly enough ( chat bugs, mounts etc).<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
With connected realms in play I really hope they'll get rid of CRZ.<br />
<br />
They won´t. They fix two very different problems. CRZ was not implemented to fix server populations problems ( ie AH, Raiding, Guilds).. CRZ was implemented to fix the issue where almost all players are in Pandaria, not in the lower zones.</div></div><hr />

Did you see that EQNext preview?<br />
<br />
I hate to say it but the hemorrhaging of players has only been going on for a little over a year now and it started near the end of Cata. It takes time to develop new tech and no company has done this yet. Why aren't all the competitors with ground breaking tech who have less than a million subs doing this? Because they don't care about their players.<br />

I'll believe EQNext is good when SOE decides to be a good company again. When they took over for Verant the EQ franchise was never the same.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that would be nice, but the problem is that most of those 10:1 pvp servers also have login queues.. especially the big 3 servers<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
or maybe they are doing it this way to avoid thousands of people being forced to change character names and the drama that would unfold surrounding who gets what name? As well as what to do with the multitude of inactive characters associated with each realm, allowing them to avoid a Age of conan style deletion of characters that are innactive.<br />
<br />
personally, i'm glad they are doing it this way, i have a hard enough time as it is coming up with names for new alts nvm potentially losing names i've been known as for years and having to come up with new ones<br />
<br />
Anyone who cannot see the benefits of connected servers over merged servers just needs to ask Warhammer or AOC players (from launch), what they think. There was so much anger and guild breakups because of server mergers. Blizzard is very smart, they learned from the mistakes of others.</div></div><hr />

So cool that Blizzard is able to actually make this happen. Merging servers would have upset more people than what they're currently going to be implementing now. Servers can now feel full inside a capital, people can keep their character and guild names and most importantly, guilds and AH's can grow again. So many servers have next to nothing on their respective AH's and guilds are so dead, this will address both. Can't wait. Some are against it, I love it. Farming for rares will be even more of a pain, but that is the only drawback in my eyes. JMO and I stand by it. :)</div></div><hr />

Which would only further delay how long it takes players to get into the groove of the changes and its impact on features like Flex mode which should benefit from this change. It is still a new thing and has the potential to cause issues so I understand not wanting to roll it out the same time as everything else. It sucks being hit with realm stability issues and not being able to play the new patch and even more so when it is only a few select realms that are impacted. Personally this feature should have hit live a bit before the patch when realms are less busy and gives more live data to go forward with into the new patch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2013-08-05, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How they could have simply merged the servers in a few easy steps.<br />
<br />
1. Implement a surname system like many other games have. This would allow you to keep your current name, and even spice it up a bit more. Give people a week to choose new names.<br />
2. Begin server merging process. Select one medium population realm and several low ones.<br />
3. Disallow new AH posts and new mail on the low population realms for a period of 3-7 days, letting people on that realm know they must empty the AH and mailbox before merges<br />
4. At the end of that period, merge the low population realms into the medium one. Doing it this way will allow for less guild name clashes.<br />
5. In the event of a duplicate guild name, the guild with more members will win the rights to the name. The other will receive a free guild name change.<br />
<br />
So there's no real point in using fancy terms like &quot;connected&quot; realms. Just merge the damn things.<br />
<br />
And what is the benefit of doing it your way over the their way? Your way causes a lot more headaches for players without any noticeable benefits. And your way doesn´t solve the problem of returning players suddenly not seeing their server name on the list anymore. So you failed to fix one of the major things they wanted to avoid, and your other ´fixes´ cause more headaches then connected realms do.<br />

I personally can't wait to see them battle it out. And if they merge the BMAH it will be a much more effective as a gold sink.<br />
<br />
As for the raiding scene, well we will have to see. My realm already has enough 'raiding' guilds, most of them 10 man start ups that will go nowhere. Sure the merging will probably get them further into the content, the old 25mans might have an easier time with their roster but I don't think it will revive anything.<br />

you and some other want to merg realm but blizzard doesn't want to. so your out of luck doesn't matter how many caps your using or how much you yell blizzard rarly change theymind. and for 20 euro you could fix it by your self. but no you didn't want to because your greedy to take action into your own hand. its rather easy to whine on the forum asking blizzard to get there hand dirty.<br />

Yes, I hope that their goal is an evolving architecture that allows them to slowly increase the size of the super-servers and diminish the actual number of them so that eventually, you will be able to guild or play with any of your friends seamlessly. (except for the dubious caveat of factions).<br />

Its a pretty big disappointment to me that this is 'delayed until after the patch', although they tiptoed around actually saying that. This was the 'big feature' to me this patch, even bigger then flexraiding.<br />

well connecting all realm into a gaint realm will probebly be the day i quite. but thats because of massive fps issues. how would you see anyting with more then 5k people spamming chat and stuff in stormwind or orgrimmar? <br />
<br />
I believe CRZ kicks in well before 5k players are in a zone.</div></div><hr />

There is nothing that states it being permanent.<br />
That is a huge part of why it is virtual rather than a traditional and irreversible merge.<br />

Giant realms are simply not a good option given how the economy in the game is driven.<br />
There is already stupid amounts of competition and undercutting due to the supply of many items, imagine making it 10 or 20 times worse.<br />

At the touch of a button the can theoretically combine or split as many as they like without ever having to worry about identity and naming consequences.<br />
<br />
The realms will never be unlinked. They said it is permanent. Besides, can you imagine what would happen if they suddenly unlinked them and guilds that had 8 raiders from Realm A, 8 raiders from Realm B and 11 raiders from Realm C suddenly all were out on their own?</div></div><hr />

There is not a single benefit to merging servers that connecting servers does not fix. This has all of the benefits of server merges without the headaches of random name changes and guild name changes. You really need to talk to some of those original AOC and Warhammer players to find out just how disruptive mergers were.<br />

Are you saying High Pop servers are a problem? A lot of us would love our servers to return to medium/high pop status. Connected realms should solve this problem without paying for a transfer.<br />

<br />
And without requiring name changes, or guilds to break up and be reformed.. and a host of other negative things. People are really stupid.. Blizzard announces subscription numbers every quarter. Even when they lost 1.3M subscribers in 3 months, they announced it themselves. Do you really think they are ´avoiding´ server mergers because of PR, don´t you think they would avoid announcing subscriber numbers if that were the case???. Connectiing servers solves a lot of huge problems that games like AOC and Warhammer had when they merged servers. It is a much more intelligent way of doing things.</div></div><hr />

Have you heard of &quot;mega server&quot; from ESO? Let me guess, ESO is pre-merging their realms because Bethesda know ESO is &quot;in fact, dying&quot; before it launches?<br />

Connected realm is a much better solution to various player population problems compared to server merge. Yet without understanding what it is, people like you default to the &quot;omg wow is dying&quot; stupidity.

The worse LFR/LFD groups I have been in have been with these groups, and I'm not the only one who feels this way.<br />

<br />
Well considering blizz keeps losing more and more revenue due to lost subs, wouldn't an idea(other than more store items) be to lower the upkeep cost of the game? The less servers there are the more they save on a daily basis when they don't constantly have to maintain the large amount there currently are. Yes actually merging servers could cause issues with names but in some of the time they spent making virtual realms they could have figured out a way so people didn't lose names on a merger.<br />
<br />
WoW isn't going to magically go back to the amount of subs it had during Wrath, the games age is preventing it from doing so. Cutting 30 or so servers out of the upkeep cost and letting people keep they names on a merge would have to be better than keeping all these dead servers around when barely anyone plays on them. They keep these servers around for no other reason than to keep the illusion that the game is doing fine even when it costs them in the long run due to upkeep and even more lost subs due to people not wanting to transfer but not wanting to play on dead realms.<br />
<br />
I do think virtual realms are a nice idea and a long time coming. However them being pushed back and the fact they are still burning money on upkeep of these dead servers doesn't help anything.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wow2011</div><div class="date">2013-08-05, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So how is this any different than merging servers?

For some reason the MMORPG community always thinks once the word &quot;Merge&quot; comes into play that the game is dying (even though it's natural for populations to shift after launch, especially this long after release).<br />
<br />
Since a lot of people seem to not know how connected realm compares to server merges, I will write a bit on that.<br />
<br />
To start, let's talk about some problems that these 2 approaches attempt to resolve:<br />
1. low population<br />
2. faction imbalance<br />
3. population increase/decline pattern based on real life (ppl going away for summer, soldiers get deployed when war happens, less people log on during weekend morning, etc.)<br />
4. Difficulties finding guilds that fit your specific need/play hours from lack of people in similar situation<br />
<br />
Now, let's move on to the 2 different solutions and compare/contrast them for each of the problem.<br />
1. The two approaches will resolve the situation equally well immediately after the change. However, once people start resubbing for whatever reason (new expansion for example), server merge approach will take a heavy toll. People will experience queue time and unable to quest because of lag and/or quest items getting farmed by many others. This problem wouldn't exist for virtual realm as you can crank out multiple instnaces of the same zone. For example, a quest requiring you to farm guards at Stormwind, server merge can only get 1 instance of stormwind for 1000 people while virtual realm can crank out 10 different instances of stormwind to host 1000 people.<br />
<br />
2. Merging server cannot solve faction imbalance at all. The best Blizz can do by merging is run some calculation and hope faction number never change. However, with virutal realm, players can potentially be split into faction balanced zones. For example, if you have 100 horde and 10 alliance in zone A, virtual realm could split zone A into 2 different instances. 1st instance has 10 horde and 10 alliance while 2nd instance has 90 horde.<br />
<br />
3. Neither approach necessarily resolve this problem. However, since virtual realm can potentially link up all servers together, virtual realm has a better shot at providing higher player volumn at any given point in time. Server merges on the other hand has a set max capacity. Blizzard will not want to merge 3 million players into a single server but Blizzard can put 3 million players into a single virtual realm.<br />
<br />
4. Same analysis as 3.<br />
<br />
There is no TL;DR version. If you don't know the difference and don't feel like reading/thinking then just get this: &quot;virtual realm is not server merge and virtual realm &gt; server merge&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't be suprised to see them go live a few weeks post 5.4. They will spend a couple weeks hotfixing any bugs in the lost isle, 5.4 raid, flexraid tech and new arena team functionality before they jump headfirst into connected realms.</div></div><hr />

They can see that the numbers of raids completed each week have likely steeply declined. Guilds have probably vanished or become idle. So, with virtualization tech, they innovated a fix. I'm betting it was in the cards while CRZ was being developed and deployed, as a &quot;test bed&quot; or trial. So if it's being implemented as a long-term solution to help the low-pop realms, it's not going to hurt high-pop realms. They wouldn't implement something that counteracts the very goal it was created to achieve.</div></div><hr />

very simple this is only going to effect servers that are low pop. they said NOTHING about servers that have huge server imbalances.

<br />
This may or may not be the case. It would depend on what demographics they're using to determine the population status of the realm. If faction balance is worked into the equation, then it could potentially fix that as well. At least, that would be what makes sense. Matching a high-pop, horde dominant realm with a high-pop, alliance dominated realm. It all really depends on how the background infrastructure is setup. If its just a virtual tunnel they're creating to bind the two realms together, then it may cause problems. If there's a &quot;middleman&quot; or mediary server that mediates between the two realms and combines them into a cluster, then it would work out provided that mediary hardware is upgraded to handle that larger load.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, I have NO idea how this is gonna work anyway in practical world, decent chunk of realms are pretty much single/double nation realms that are used to have chat in their language for years, one bad merge and they are gonna loose more people from those realms that they would get by the merge. I saw that like half a year ago, our server got some FCT and couple dozen people transferred, saw trade and general filled with something else that english and started flaming everyone and demanded the 2 thousand players to use strictly english in chat for those maybe 50 people, if course they pretty much got flamed back and told to not expect it any time soon. In the end they eihter stopped playing or transferred elsewhere for cash since I havent seen them since. Now imagine it on a much larger scale when most of the people on the internet are unreasonably stubborn, put into it the fact, that lots of people dont actually know english very well and chat is gonna be a mess thats gonna make loads of people leave. This HAS to be done properly and Blizzard really needs to do serious research of communities on the realms targeted for the merge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
fun fact: nobody wants to play on evenly sided realms<br />
<br />
imagine 1:1 ratios on a High/Full pop server. Want to do Oondasta? Galleon? Nalak? Sha? Good luck. Dailies? Good luck. Leveling 85-90? Node farming?<br />
<br />
server imbalances were created by the players on purpose to stack their odds and make their life easier. if a majority of people actually want blizzard to force all realms attempt to be as 1:1 as possible then more people would complain simply because the game would actually be HARD in WPVP again<br />
<br />
it's funny because I wouldn't mind trying it but I know I would immediately regret it because it's such a fucked concept.<br />

<br />
imagine 1:1 ratios on a High/Full pop server. Want to do Oondasta? Galleon? Nalak? Sha? Good luck. Dailies? Good luck. Leveling 85-90? Node farming?<br />
<br />
server imbalances were created by the players on purpose to stack their odds and make their life easier. if a majority of people actually want blizzard to force all realms attempt to be as 1:1 as possible then more people would complain simply because the game would actually be HARD in WPVP again<br />
<br />
it's funny because I wouldn't mind trying it but I know I would immediately regret it because it's such a fucked concept.<br />

Now... this &quot;maybbbeee one or two realms and mayyyybeeee after 5.4&quot; backtrack is really disappointing. The original hint seemed like it would be launch day, and that most realms would already be coalesced and ready to go.<br />

Up until now we've been holding onto the hope that we'd be able to recruit to do SoO because of Virtual Realms. Now today they announce they don't actually know when it's coming. Heh. My sub is currently not active, and I won't be activating it at all if they don't drop this on the first week. It's already too little too late.

We haven’t yet determined when we’ll be creating the first Connected Realms, but we expect it will be some time after the launch of Patch 5.4.<br />
<br />
(and they are still using the name change factor an excuse to not do a real merge)<br />
Other alternatives such as merging realms would require us to force character name changes if there were conflicts, and could lead to confusion for returning players who’d log in to find their realm missing from the realm list. Some players also feel strong ties to their realm’s name or history, and we don’t want to erase that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the fact that the realms will be permanently connected means Blizzard will not join too many realms together, so in most cases low pop realms won't become a high pop realm overnight. But they can still join one medium or medium to high with one or two low pop realms, so, not all hope is lost.</div></div><hr />

Since they are combining servers, they will probably put high populated servers with low populated servers. That would not have a que time or locked for that server.</div></div><hr />

I think the best solution they could of offered is to allow people one free server transfer per toon every six months and let the players sort out the population issues. I think the way they are trying to fix this issue will in the end not work out well and will just lead to further to frustration for the players on many of the small population servers.</div></div><hr />

The players have sorted out the population issues. That's why they're all crowded up on a relative handful of realms.</div></div><hr />

Everyone on the planet that's interested knows they're losing subscribers at a rapid rate. It's not like it's a secret or anything. The only bad press associated with server merges really is for games that don't provide specifics about their subscribers. Which happens to be most of them. We know they're around 7.7 milliion. We know they were around 10-11 million not so long ago.<br />
<br />
The bad press has already happened. I still don't understand why people say this when it's really goddamn clear to everyone that cares that WoW has lost a lot of business over the last couple of years. That news is already out there. Server merges or something like them aren't terrible news when you already know what's happened.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eroginous</div><div class="date">2013-08-06, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda glad they've finally released the blog post, been waiting for it for quite a while. While I'm relieved to see they will only merge realms of the same type, a couple of things still concern me. Will heirlooms be cross-connected-realm (as seems to be the case), would like a confirmation on this.<br />
<br />
From what they're saying, connected realms will be a 'seamless' experience, which indicates that all things available to one server would be available to all servers that are connected (mail, trading, AH, ect). <br />
<br />
The problem that arises is now we have connected realms, what happens with realms that aren't connected? Will we be able to mail BoAs between those? If we want to make a new character on a different server, are we still screwed unless we just happened to get lucky with the realms they pick to be connected? <br />
<br />
<br />
This annoys me quite a bit. For me, connected realms are the thing I'm looking forward to most out of the announced features, and it worries me that it might still take a lóng time after the 5.4 release before it's applied to all realms. The dying/empty realms issue is one of the main things that is putting me off WoW at the moment.<br />
<br />
Overall I find the post to be pretty vague, and I'm hoping some more information will come our way soon. <br />
<br />
The entire post annoys me. Rather than offer specific details on this feature and how it impacts players, they spend half the article talking about why they are doing it. Not sure about you guys, but I could give a fuck about why they are doing it. All I care about is how this will impact players, and thus far, they've been vague across the board.</div></div><hr />

<br />
where did i say that players were scheming together to do it? simply put imbalances started at vanilla, and they eventually grew bigger and bigger. for instance people started rolling horde on certain realms because perhaps horde pvp or pve was good there and they had reputable guilds. eventually this made the problem bigger and bigger as more people went to servers that were a raid spot or pvp spot safe haven for them- nobody is going to xfer to horde sargeras or alliance illidan unless they are insane, they'll never get a pve group and never down a world boss.<br />
<br />
blizzard wasn't the one who made the server imbalances, the players did. it was intentional in the sense that eventually people didn't want to attempt to balance it out by themselves because they wanted the easy way of doing things (ie no competition in leveling, farming, etc)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean a universal BoA sharing system, not just for merged servers. It's annoying to mule stuff back and forth, though Blizzard loves it, cuz it gives money. They've said for the longest time now that &quot;some time in the future we might do it when the tech allows it&quot;. I'd think that day has come, but they don't seem to have the will to do it.</div></div><hr />

we’re considering a number of factors, including Battlegroup, population, and faction balance.<br />

<br />
Grouping tons of players onto a few realms just means queues and a potentially suboptimal experience due to lag and stuff like that. Also, it's better for them to actually release the feature when it's ready, not when you think it should be released. If they feel it needs more testing, then it probably needs more testing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't say nobody. Back when transfers were half off my guild decided to take a look at servers to try to find something better than what we were on with a balanced horde to alliance ratio. Let me just say, there really aren't any. The only once that have balanced populations are lower pop ones. So in the end we decided it wasn't worth transferring and stuck with our current PoS server because hey, at least it won't cost us a ton of money for absolutely no reason.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm not a big fan of the super high population servers that are very one sided. I like world PvP. It gets a bit boring without it. And I really hope that this helps our realm out. Our horde to alliance ratio is about 2 to 1 right now but pretty much we're the only progression raiding guild that's alliance side. It'd be nice to perhaps have more options and not always have to recruit off server, or not have recruits turn up their nose at our server because it isn't 'Zomg populated!' like Sargeras or something. Personally I'd like a bit more population on my server but there is such a thing as over populated and there's a damn good reason my guild and I haven't transferred to one of overly populated realms.<br />
<br />
In the end though, to each their own. Everyone has different likes/dislikes in this game but I do think that this will generally help the realms that really could use a little help. Now if only they could come up with a more useful way for guilds to recruit than a stupid forum based system. I mean, for gods sake, there has to be something better after all this time!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sorry but no. Many of the people on these low population realms haven't been able to play with a enjoyable playing experience this entire expansion while Blizzard has let a long standing problem fester. I am tired of waiting and many others are as well. They have been able to take care of the problem for a long time now and choose not to and telling people they just need to wait it out longer is not ok. I am done with Blizzard after the terrible treatment they have given players on this issue. It's not a lot of fun not being able to play a mmo with other people, they have done the worst population management for a mmo I have ever seen or heard of.<br />
<br />
Also I will trade q times to be able to play with other people. World of Warcraft is a terrible single player game imo. If I wanted a single player game I would of bought that and over the course of this expansion that's what I have gotten with seeing my realm die.</div></div><hr />
