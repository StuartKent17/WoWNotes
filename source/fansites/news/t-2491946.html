Not only do you get to trial any damn class you like, you also get a free boost to 110 with the expansion (and probably 120 by the end of BFA), so you only have to level 10 levels if you're new. Yeah, it's kind of shit for alts, but new players wouldn't of done the old content multiple times like the rest of the wow veterans have, so that too in theory should be a non issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is that a disservice? Is that the classic &quot;I had to do it so they should have to, too&quot; argument you're making? And it's not about someone being intimidated by 110-120, it's about a level 1 being intimidated by the slow, tedious leveling process from 1-120+ A &quot;level squish&quot; would mean those 120 levels get dropped to 50 for example. How the exp and all the zones works I don't know. I'd imagine you can pick your zones and the process is overall quicker, otherwise it's just smoke and mirrors and defeats the entire purpose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These games are all about invested time. MMOs are a niche genre and not many people are even going to try out new MMO if it were to come out these days. Current multiplayer market is quick come and go matches. Now imagine all these „WoW1” accounts that milions of people had invested tens of thousands of hours in suddenly perish. Many of these people wouldnt start again. I don’t even know if I would.<br />
<br />
Making new WoW would be very costly with low probability of success.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunate if that is a case, because that is likely someones job. <br />
<br />
Although it would seem weird for someone to jump the gun or misunderstand. If the misunderstand that means that from the Q&amp;A to this point they believed a level squish was happening and prepared a survey to put out without anyone telling him. Jumping the gun means he really jumped the gun (Unless the announcement about a level squish was coming before blizzcon) and that more than one people probably had been jumping the same gun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Papanacho</div><div class="date">2019-06-14, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am happy about the stat squish. It would make leveling fun and meaningful again where your character gets more powerful each level, not like now, where you get a higher level, but after 60+ nothing happens, you get the odd unlock of new talents, but for 14 levels you do absolutely nothing. I am leveling a rogue and ohh god I am already bored with it, dinging after every dungeon it doesnt feel like I have achieved anything, but at the earlier levels I was excited about new skills. <br />
<br />
Wow will have a problem in the future if they dont do that. Leveling is not fun at all and meaningless, this could make it a little bit more exciting and interesting. It would be also a good idea to reduce the time you take to max out a character or if you could just do it in any zone moreless as you wish, ( Similar to ESO) There are so many amazing quests out there in the world that are forgotten or not played at all.</div></div><hr />

If they reduce the xp required to level, people will see that the levels come fast and a higher max number will not be so intimidating (if it even is).<br />
<br />
Stat squish is bad enough. Level squish is so anti-rpg. Just make WoW 2 and do it right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think about it this way, they continually put more and more time into fixing and adjusting the current game engine instead of putting that effort into building a new one...<br />
<br />
Depending how they handled a WoW2 with character transfer/progressions transfer. Having to start completely fresh would most likely kill their game because no one wants to just let go of everything they've worked for. Take a look at how many people were upset with the transfer from Destiny 1 to Destiny 2 when you lost everything just because the Tower was blown up.<br />
<br />
About the engine thing though. If the rumour about Diablo 4's new engine is legit then there could possibly be a chance that they somehow port WoW over to it if it works out. Rumour that Diablo 4 is an open world adventure version of Diablo is why the engine is being built and how many similar systems the two games share now then we could hope for such a thing. With it being rumours though there isn't much reason to listen to it until the truth is revealed but one can be hopeful.</div></div><hr />

I want a level squish, First of all, it would make leveling feel better it Fucking stupid, that for some classes between level 58 and like 70 or so, you get no New abilitys Expect a taltent at level 60. IT stupid that Some classes first get core mechanics in the 70's or 80s. you dont learn shit by that.<br />
the fact we dont have skill points anymore that means there are most levels you dont gain an ything from leveling up. sometimes long distances of levels with Nothing. it does not feelgood to just &quot;oh i leveled up, 6 more and i get a something...&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe the intention is to make levels reward abilities more frequently something, otherwise its an optics change and not a change to leveling speed, because they still want you to get through X zones and storylines without it being breakneck fast. They might consolidate some continents though for scaling, picking whatever, so you'd have less in that regard but probably the same number of quests done. Don't really get why they decreased leveling speed way back in 7.3.5 and then they've just been walking back on it ever since. Only reason I can think of was because it made the Heritage Armor take longer, and that was essentially 'content' for a lot of players.<br />
<br />
I've never really considered the gaps between abilities being rewarded to be that big of a deal, but there's people out there who constantly give feedback on this matter, not that I think it's a big deal.<br />
<br />
The devs might think the optics change will make the game more interesting for brand new players and retention and all that, and seem less daunting, but yeah, we know it's just optics<br />

I get that people dont want to be &quot;depowered&quot; but, the levels in wow is getting out of hand. It hard to tell my friend who might considering playing wow &quot;oh yea. There is only 130 levels you have to go though&quot;<br />
<br />
This is what I'm referring to, yeah. People think 130s going to be seen super negatively even it's just optics and the levels have been nerfed over time. Which is still weird because they offer a boost with the game</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaver</div><div class="date">2019-06-14, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always hate hearing them talk about “new players this.. and new players that..”. What about your current players? At one point you had 10 millions... maybe if you had focused on keeping those players instead of always attracting new ones, WoW would be in a better state..<br />

That said, I think the lvl squish is a good idea.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drynix</div><div class="date">2019-06-14, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aside from a level squish they should add an exp squish. Currently most classes do not get anything between 58 and 70. But if after the squish this gets condensed to level 40-41 but still take the same ammount of time it will still suck. The issues isn't just the ammount of levels between meaningful development of your character, its also the time invested to develop your character.<br />
<br />
And I do recall from one of the streams or a blue post that it was purely a level squish while still needed the same total exp from 1 to whatever the new cap would be as it is currently from 1 to cap.</div></div><hr />

With scaling world and no new abilities, your character actually gets weaker with every level, and the only real power gain happens with better gear. At that point leveling becomes basically just another time gate for access to endgame content</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrLachyG</div><div class="date">2019-06-14, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the intention is to make levels reward abilities more frequently something, otherwise its an optics change and not a change to leveling speed, because they still want you to get through X zones and storylines without it being breakneck fast. They might consolidate some continents though for scaling, picking whatever, so you'd have less in that regard but probably the same number of quests done. Don't really get why they decreased leveling speed way back in 7.3.5 and then they've just been walking back on it ever since. Only reason I can think of was because it made the Heritage Armor take longer, and that was essentially 'content' for a lot of players.<br />
<br />
I've never really considered the gaps between abilities being rewarded to be that big of a deal, but there's people out there who constantly give feedback on this matter, not that I think it's a big deal.<br />
<br />
The devs might think the optics change will make the game more interesting for brand new players and retention and all that, and seem less daunting, but yeah, we know it's just optics<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
well they can add new stuff in. abilities that have been pruned over the years. and adding talent rows in for 110/120/130 wouldn't hurt either</div></div><hr />

Thats bascially what Artifact in legion and HoA in BfA has been. &quot;talents&quot; after you reach max lvl.<br />
<br />
I dont mind a lvl squish, and I hope they slash it down to lvl 50/60. Imagine leveling from 1 to 60 on retail and getting all the abilites/talents along the way. Makes much more sense. Right now from lvl 100 to 120 you gain nothing.</div></div><hr />

Right now character progression basically ends at level 80 and it gets SUPER boring. You get another talent at 90 and 100.... but the things that make the last few expansions meaningful are gone.<br />
<br />
You no longer spend time building up your WoD garison.<br />
<br />
You aren't able to upgrade your artifact weapon anymore.<br />
<br />
And trust me, as soon as BFA is over, this shit-show of a Azerite Necklace will get the same fate.<br />
<br />
When the next expansion shows up, you really won't want to go from level 80 to 120 with nothing but two talents to show for it.</div></div><hr />

It isn't the amount of levels that makes new or returning players leave, it's that leveling is fucking boring. And this is due to snowballed designs. <br />
New players are thrown into a world of hand-holding and zero risks, of course they get deterred. Imagine not being particularly interested in WoW but giving it a try, and this kind of leveling is what you're thrown into for over 100 hours?<br />
<br />
Hell, I used to love leveling alts before it became utterly pathetically easy and more like a hack-and-slash instead of the RPG it used to be.<br />
An RPG where you don't care about gear upgrades, where getting new abilities doesn't really make any difference, where consumables and resource-management is almost completely irrelevant.<br />
<br />
To make it abundandtly clear: A level squish does not solve leveling's problems.<br />
Levelings problems are:<br />
Too easy, even without heirlooms;<br />
-Creates a leveling experience where gear upgrades doesn't feel impactful.<br />
-Devalues class' abilities that doesn't merely deal damage or increase your speed.<br />
-Reduces the social aspect since you rarely have a reason to group up.<br />
Mob scaling means that you are essentially on the same exact player:mob player ratio throughout the entire thing, with some minor spikes here and there.<br />
New talent system is godawful anywhere but at maxlevel. There are plenty of specs that gain next to NOTHING interesting for 30+ levels if the talents in that range are pointless during leveling.<br />
No reason to do any side-stuff what so ever, next to nothing that is worth some &quot;side-progression&quot; will make a difference at 120 anyway.<br />
Professions being stuck at 5 skill / level, coupled with an insane level/hour, means it's more or less impossible to level professions at a reasonable pace and keeping up with your level.<br />
<br />
In short, leveling is a soulless husk devoid of RPG gameplay, it's a hack-and-slash where you are just automatically placed in Blizzards perfect template, as you faceroll your way to maxlevel. <br />
Players aren't deterred by the number 120, they are deterred by the gameplay that is goddamn awful throughout the entire process!</div></div><hr />

And do you not understand why the gameplay has been terrible throughout the process?<br />
- Each level is meaningless, they can't give a new spell or talent for each level when our max is 120. It would be a nightmare to balance.<br />
- The levelling process has to be made easy, otherwise, nobody would go through the 1-120 ride. Imagine classic levelling but for 60 more levels, yea no, never gonna happen.<br />
<br />
By reducing the number of levels required to reach the max level, they can make each level more meaningful without cluttering the game with spells/talents. They can make each level more difficult to attain. They are probably looking at Classic levelling and realize why the journey was good once upon a time and why it can never be like that when you have to go through 120 levels.<br />

Doing a level squish is an attempt to fix just about everything you just complained about. With fewer levels, the pacing can be made much better.<br />

<br />
It still takes the same amount of time to go from 1-12 as it today takes from 1-120. Ok. So the bar moves slower.<br />
<br />
The only &quot;issue&quot; is, that today, on a Monk, at lvl 80 you have all your abilities unlocked on all specs. This means from 80-120 you have your whole toolkit except the talents.<br />
<br />
If they squish it to 12 lvls, and you get 1 ability per lvl, now you have LESS abilities on lvl 8-11 than you do today.<br />
<br />
The classes already feel naked enough during leveling, so this would make the problem worse, not better. All in the name of getting 1 ability per lvl?</div></div><hr />

While that might be ok for many there's also the creeping feeling that your efforts are realy worthless in fact. Time gating or rep grinds don't solve that issue. For me I have given up caring about gear and rewards as they mean nothing in a few weeks time. It has to be the gameplay itself and how you can jump right in and have fun. Sadly BoF just has nice visuals and music but doesn't deliver at gamplay. It needs a new formula.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Levels have become meaningless yes, with mob scaling, removal of spell ranks etc. I understand very well that it's very hard to grant something meaningful every level (impossible), but we've hit the point where people have almost their entire core arsenal at level 60 then just keep facerolling to 120<br />
<br />
Tt wouldn't work if 61-120 was an extension of old leveling speeds. I do naturally understand that they had to speed things up eventually, but they took out the gameplay along the way. We've long since passed the point where our characters are so powerful by default that it devolves the gameplay into mindless buttonmashing, because you are never under threat from dying. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Doing a level squish is an attempt to fix just about everything you just complained about. With fewer levels, the pacing can be made much better.<br />
<br />
That is the one thing leveling squish can accomplish really, halving level total would make each level possibly feel more satisfying to attain, and hopefully they can space things out better so that you are more likely to gain something substantial &quot;more often&quot;.<br />
They'd have to use this opportunity to maybe make the &quot;last 25%&quot; of levels to have more significant stuff too. Now, players are essentially &quot;complete&quot; at level 80, or 66% to 120. Maybe after the squish, you can get to this point at around 85-90% instead, ie at level 51-54 or so, instead of level 40.<br />
<br />
But if the core gameplay issues are still there, then it won't make a big difference in the end. If we're still facerolling mobs that pose no danger, then it'll be the same but with dings being farther inbetween.<br />
<br />
They have to rebalance player:mob power ratios in order to reinvigorate leveling.<br />
But that probably also requires them removing mob scaling too. I really hope they do, I would much rather see a bigger range of +/- levels of mobs/quests that grant experience, than to always have mobs be at my exact level. It makes leveling up feel so much less like a progression when mobs are literally glued to my level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Leveling should be an empowering experience through richer gameplay, more skills and let's face it, limited mob scaling per zones so you can feel a difference between entering a zone and finishing it. Currently, leveling is atrocious for most specs because of the lack of a talents tree and absolute mob scaling. There is no empowering feeling at all.<br />
<br />
Endgame should be an empowering experience. Nowadays it is mostly a cosmetics collecting game, as the power difference relative to invested time is marginal.</div></div><hr />

You seem to lack basic understanding of math.<br />
<br />
If you think level number changes pacing, you are in for surprise. It changes absolutely nothing. It is still same amount of XP, just twice more XP per level. It is still same content, same difficulty, same handholding, same mechanics.<br />
<br />
Today you'll gain 2 levels, after squish you'll gain 1 level. Effort required is the same, effort required to get to end content is the same.<br />
<br />
Level squish doesn't make any difference. Leveling is still irrelevant in retail, level numbers are meaningless - you are either leveling or you are at max level. Retail has destroyed any sense of progression because world offers no danger, classes are tuned to be gods, mobs scale to your level and questing is dumb linear, like watching a B movie.<br />

Indeed. However this is unrelated to level squish - rebalance will have same effect if max level is 120 or 60.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Anything that isn't current, set the level cap at, for example 60.<br />
-Allow players to choose their own levelling route through all non-current content once they've exited their starting zones (where relevant).<br />
-Once you're at 60, you enter current content. You then level using a &quot;paragon&quot; system, so instead of 61, 62, 63 etc, you go 60*, 60**, 60** (or something more elegant) to whatever the new expansion cap is.<br />
-When the next expansion comes along, level cap remains the same, previous expansion becomes old content and is subject to old content rules, new content is progressed using the paragon system.<br />
<br />
Obviously there'll need to be a feeling of powering up as you progress through levelling, should that be 1-60, or whatever method is used to measure current content progression, but thas another discussion entirely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes and no, I wouldn't say it's unrelated per se. The reason I bring it up is because the leveling squish is part of Blizzards (attempted) fixing of the leveling experience, if they &quot;only&quot; focus on halving total amount of levels to get, but leave the gameplay issues as they are, then the squish won't really accomplish much in order to make leveling feel better. Or in short, they shouldn't to A without also doing B, because both are desperately needed and should happen at the same time.<br />

I really, really hope they'll reevaluate the mob scaling system. I do enjoy being able to finish zones, but the tradeoff is too much. Outleveling mobs and zones that used to be dangerous was one of very few tangible &quot;progressions&quot; that were left in leveling at the time when they added it.</div></div><hr />

These are the things that I hope it accomplishes:<br />
<br />
- Make leveling less intimidating to new players, so that more of them level their class instead of boosting to end game.<br />
- Make gear progression more interesting. All of the previous item level squishes have made it so that you sometimes get gear while leveling that has the same stats as gear you got 5 levels ago.<br />
- Allow for more content choice, like maybe you can reach max level doing only vanilla + current expansion, or you can split your leveling across expansions.<br />
<br />
Ultimately this wont have too much of an impact on me as all my toons are already max level so i'll just see a lower number when i log in, but i supposed it might encourage me to level some allied races.</div></div><hr />

The reason I bring it up is because the leveling squish is part of Blizzards (attempted) fixing of the leveling experience, if they &quot;only&quot; focus on halving total amount of levels to get, but leave the gameplay issues as they are, then the squish won't really accomplish much in order to make leveling feel better. Or in short, they shouldn't to A without also doing B, because both are desperately needed and should happen at the same time.<br />

<br />
If you think level number changes pacing, you are in for surprise. It changes absolutely nothing. It is still same amount of XP, just twice more XP per level. It is still same content, same difficulty, same handholding, same mechanics.<br />
<br />
Today you'll gain 2 levels, after squish you'll gain 1 level. Effort required is the same, effort required to get to end content is the same.<br />
<br />
Level squish doesn't make any difference. Leveling is still irrelevant in retail, level numbers are meaningless - you are either leveling or you are at max level. Retail has destroyed any sense of progression because world offers no danger, classes are tuned to be gods, mobs scale to your level and questing is dumb linear, like watching a B movie.<br />
<br />
How can you say that it will be the same, if they push 120 levels of XP into 60 levels, each level will require way more work to (similar to Classic). The issue here is that you're only looking at it from a math perspective. Perception is very important, the feeling you get when starting at 1 looking at going to 120 is way more daunting than 1-60. Also, believe it or not, even if the XP required is the same it will feel less tedious to &quot;only&quot; gain 60 levels and the horrible quest pacing we have atm (you gain levels so quickly you have to change zones every hour).<br />
<br />
If they can also give you something each level, the levelling process is suddenly rewarding. At the moment, you reach level 100 and you're basically done with the game in terms of character progression (until you get azerite armor). And even before lvl 100 you barely notice that you're actually progressing. Now think of a scenario where you gain a new spell (or even spell rank as Ion was hinting at in the video) every single level, that's character progression.<br />
<br />
I agree that the game has other major issues, but just ignoring the fact that 120 levels is a bad thing is not helping anyone.<br />
- Remove mob scaling<br />
- Make mobs more difficult overall<br />
- Remove heirlooms<br />
- Make elite quests elite again<br />
- Use Classics layering instead of the shitshow we have today<br />
- Reduce spell taxation on the server so the game doesn't lag out whenever you're more than 40 ppl in the same zone<br />
<br />
These are all problems I have with the current game, but so is 120. I've wanted a level squish for years now together with a revamped talent system.</div></div><hr />

The problem of leveling in WoW being boring is a different problem though. It also depends on if you are leveling your 30th character or if you are new to the game. I wonder how many people will actually try to enjoy Classic's leveling instead of racing to max level.<br />
<br />
Btw, &quot;'First Level x&quot; archivements are BS, because there are already enough incentives to reach max level quickly. It's like Blizzard wants people to race though leveling content, so why not simply set chars to max level right away and make the game all about gearlevel?</div></div><hr />

but nunmberwise ? or timewise ?<br />
<br />
because imo the problem is not number of level but the amount of hours that it takes to get to max level . <br />
<br />
if people would get new level every 10-15 minutes it wouldnt be a problem<br />

but knowing blizzard they will cut the numbe of level but leave leveing time as it is now - because how woudl they sell 60 euro boosts.</div></div><hr />

There's some interesting skill based systems out there, you can lock stuff behind story points and achivments, and use gear quality for the rest. By doing that you can easentialy move the starting point of a game along with the expansions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Truthfully this may work better if they ever do a WoW 2 or another MMO based on another franchise. I think that they could realistically do a level squish to anything from 60 to 100 and then move to a system such as this as a future expansion model.</div></div><hr />

I don't think seasonal content is the issue it's self, it works well for alot of games like destiny and such. And it's an ideal for most people in an mmo that want new stuff and further progression for there char. The problem is that wow wasn't built for that model, it's core system is a legacy of the days when rpgs were really just digital dnd. A season ideally needs to be self contained, so ideally if you joined a game in season 6 you can level from 0 to max within season 6, and continually updating world needs a continually updating starting point.<br />

Just remove levels. <br />
You can provide meaningful char progression without some a bar you need to fill with a random resource.<br />
<br />
I mean we do it at max level in wow with ilevel. All you really need to replace is how talent points and new spells are dripped out but there's plenty of good examples of how to do that without levels</div></div><hr />

If you have one talent every 15 levels and get everything automatically while you level up the system would be as shit as today but it just takes longer per level.<br />
<br />
Here is one try to fix leveling:<br />
<br />
Squish the max level to 50 or something.<br />
Make 2 talent systems. <br />
One old school talent tree like classic and then on max level you unlock the new talent system which we have now. <br />
For the old school tree you would get one point per level and the talents would be something you would get automatically today like passives and new abilities. <br />
Example: Your shaman gets level 20 and you get a talent point and you can buy Earthquake. Level 21 you can buy Elemental Fury and your crits do 250% damage instead of 200%. Technically it would be very similar to the current system but you spend your points instead of getting everything automatically. <br />
In the end you would get everything in that talent tree because this system is just for leveling and not for character customization.<br />
<br />
And at max level you would get the current talent system where you can choose between 3 talents in every row. These things would be gameplay altering stuff like its today. <br />
Maybe even make it like its today where you get one talent every 15 levels ( 8-10 levels with the squish ) alongside the oldschool talent trees. I dont know, I am not a game designer, I just know that leveling a character in BFA is fucking atrocious and something needs to be changed.<br />
<br />
Also make heirlooms a tabard or something. Its really boring that you wear the same gear from 1-120.</div></div><hr />

It makes little difference, imo, if “max level” is 120 or 60 or 1200. It’s just an arbitrary number, and who cares? What does matter, though, are any other little “tweaks” Blizz intends to add to the squish. For example, let’s say it now takes someone two weeks to level a new alt to 120, will Blizz add a little metric-enhancing twist to make it so that it will now take that same person four weeks to level to whatever the new max is? <br />
<br />
This is a standard Blizz technique: They blast us with propaganda about what a good thing something is, how much they care about our game experience and “fun”, then they slip in a few gotchas. The water strider is a perfect example — the party line was how great it will be when ANY MOUNT can have water walking! Whee! But the reality is that they are removing a whole host of mount perks, so as to severely limit our ability to actually evade the dozens of mobs they require us to fight through just to get to a quest area or gather a mat. We will not see this effect so much in 8.2 because we will get flying (unless they decide to make flying just another piece of “mount equipment” to fill the one slot), but it will become a major factor in the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Max level number is unimportant. But watch out for the gotchas.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monster Hunter</div><div class="date">2019-06-14, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's think about this guys and gals, what exactly has been the point of filling that bar for the last 2 expansions? We fill a bar, we Ding and a number goes up by 1.... For what? To make us do the story of the expansion zones, that's litteraly it. But we had to do them anyway on the first char to unlock half the end game stuff and with scaling it wasn't even for gating sections of those zones.<br />
<br />
So why exactly did we have to do the last 20 levels?<br />
<br />
Just remove levels, give skill points / talent points based on in game achivments like dark souls killing a boss and gate harder content based on gear quality and attunments on a first char, and force people through the story zones with unlocking on there first char.<br />
<br />
Ontop of that give people more freedom on how they invest in a chars stats like darksouls, bring back old open talent trees. <br />
<br />
Maybe something like, you kill a boss you get 1 talent point and 100 stats from a boa drop + some loot, complete a story point and you get 1 talent and 100 stat on a boa. You choose where to put those stats and talents from a big array of ability's split into offence, defensive and maybe even crafting and other types of stuff. If your max on talents and stats then you can send the boa to an alt or sell it for a gold amount or maybe a vendor will take it and give a gear item.<br />
<br />
But what about the next expansion? How do you stop the one punch man problem where you just can't get any stronger? Well the artifact isn't far off there needs to be in each expansion an extra side avenue of progression that's tied to the story. That can also be progressed along side leveling for new chars. Each expansion has a natural point for a brand new char to jump in to the current narrative.</div></div><hr />

But the reality is that they are removing a whole host of mount perks, so as to severely limit our ability to actually evade the dozens of mobs they require us to fight through just to get to a quest area or gather a mat. We will not see this effect so much in 8.2 because we will get flying (unless they decide to make flying just another piece of “mount equipment” to fill the one slot), but it will become a major factor in the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Max level number is unimportant. But watch out for the gotchas.<br />
<br />
With all the classic hype and praise it's leveling is getting maybe they should go back to making it take 2 months to level?</div></div><hr />

My suggestion for stat squish would be to reduce back to level 60.<br />
<br />
Kalimdor &amp; Eastern Kingdoms: 1-20<br />
- Vanilla Zones: 1-20 <br />
- 1-20 zones today --&gt; 1-5 with squish<br />
- Cataclysm Zones: 15-20<br />
Outland &amp; Northrend: 20-30<br />
Pandaria &amp; Draenor: 30-40<br />
Broken Isles, Zandalar &amp; Kul Tiras: 40-50<br />
New Expansion: 50-60</div></div><hr />

<br />
Part 1: EK/Kalimdor - 5-6 zones with heirlooms to reach next part level (specific number don't really matter at least it's low enought for cosmetic purpose)<br />
Part 2: BC/WOTLK/Cata/Pandaria - 2-3 zones with heirlooms<br />
Part 3: Draenor/Legion/BfA - 2-3 zones with heirlooms<br />
Part 4: 9.0 zones.<br />

Also in the future I would allow to copy characters from Classic realms into live game.</div></div><hr />

With this, at least there's potential to get some new ability / talent every level, so there's something to look forward to on each level. And if they make this an excuse to bring back the old talent tree, a lot more easy to handle with less levels!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reaching 120 is easy and not meaningful progression. I say that as one that has several 120's. The levelling process has been a speedrun competition for the past 2-3 expansions for the vast majority of ppl because its too easy and uninteresting to go from 111 to 112, it gives you absolutely 0 satisfaction.<br />

Even currently, I only level in one MAYBE two areas with dungeons in between per expansion as is, so dropping 5 levels for each would be near unnoticeable.<br />
<br />
90 Still feels like your character is progressing during the leveling process.<br />
<br />
On a side note, It'd be awesome for them to allow us to pick which abilities we unlock while leveling after 10(core rotation for each spec learned 1-10) with a pseudo-talent system for unlocking abilities as we level instead of just giving us X ability at X level. It'd still result with no change to end game because everybody would have the same abilities as the next guy other than actual talent choices, but it'd change our leveling experience every time letting us choose what to unlock every X levels. It'd give newer players the opportunity to read and choose which ability they want, giving them the ability to actually learn what they have rather than automatically putting a button on their bar. <br />
<br />
If the new players bar is already full, it doesn't even go on their bars, and they don't even realize they have the ability. If they choose, they are forced to read and learn, closing the skill curve for newer to mediocre.</div></div><hr />

Granted, next expansion they'll just add more levels again. Rendering it pretty pointless at some point, yet again.

It absolutely will do &quot;jack s***&quot;. Right now you go many levels without getting anything but a &quot;ding&quot; in level number. With a squish they can make it so you get something every level. That is quite a bit different than it is now. And it will affect EVERY player that levels (which is most). I am not sure if you are just trolling or too self involved to see the big picture.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
it all depends on 1 - whether it will be:<br />
<br />
1) only level squish and time spent leveling staying the same because otherwise they wouldnt sell as many boosts<br />
<br />
2) they do level squish and also cut down leveling time by half. <br />
<br />
eitherway its a huge disservice towards people who have many alts just because few not so smart people are intimidated by numbers like 100 or 120.<br />
<br />
Likely it will take same time as it does now. i.e. same amount of xp to get from 1 to 90 (just example if that is their level squish max level) as it is to get from 1 to 120 now. You actually want them to make it take half as much time to get to max level as it is now? It is already ridiculously easy and quick.<br />

People need to realise that increasing the level cap of a game every single expansion is unsustainable, and a game with 130 levels (as the next expansion cap would be) is just bad game design. <br />
<br />
Your class is virtually complete by level 80, and then there is no progression of your characters strength, except for a virtual number which is made redundant anyway by level scaling.<br />
<br />
Rescaling the entire world is absolutely essential for the longevity of the game.</div></div><hr />

LMAO, yeah right.<br />
<br />
this is probably going to be as big a fuck-up as the pre-WoD stat squish that left people getting killed by previous expac mobs for weeks due to a malfunction in the hidden between-levels damage multiplier ramping the NPC damage up instead of the player's, which was only added to compensate for the lack of actual work they did squishing the numbers across all the expacs down to a lower standard.<br />
<br />
which only became a problem due to 10man/25man/normal/heroic/mythic/thunderforging/warforging inflating our Ilvl through the roof causing mythic garrosh to have a total combined health pool bigger then the older 16bit engine could handle.<br />
<br />
and now with the exact same scaling inflation from BFA's excessive use of titforging they're doing it again and because they're incompetent and stupid they'll fuck it up again.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I'd rather they keep away from a level squish until they're ready to do another old world revamp and have planned thoroughly on how they're going to jumble around the numbers. It's not like the levels are a problem as they have kept reducing the XP to next level and XP rewards totals since MoP and the stats squishes continue to throw the numbers all over the place until we end up back where we started. Not to mention the only reason they want to reduce the number of levels is to adjust when abilities/stat changes are given out whilst leveling from level one in order to make it &quot;more rewarding&quot; and will have barely any effect on a new expansion if they don't add any new abilities like the last two expansions (yes Legion had Artifact weapon abilities but we all knew they were temporary). <br />
<br />
<br />
Leveling isn't rewarding as level and item level scaling mobs has gotten rid of the feeling of getting stronger until you're HC raiding or Mythic Dungeon running in the latest content patch and can start to blow stuff up again. We've never had enough abilities in the game to get something every level (vanilla had ranks for spells which were slight upgrades over previous ones and had to be bought at a trainer) and if they did squish the level cap down to 60-70 or something whilst reshuffling when abilities are delivered we'll just be stuck with regaining the same abilities again but with an even longer time between getting them. For example, we have most of our abilities that our class gets, barring talents and masteries, around level 70, after a level squish we might have them all around level 60 which would take around the same time as getting to level 100-105 which would affect how certain classes play.<br />
<br />
As for a level squish making the 120 grind no longer seem as daunting, I'd disagree. Since WoW has a trial up to level 20 new players are able to get a sense of how difficult it is to level up in WoW (not at all) and considering classic will be out soon and a new player is just as likely to try that as WoW, they'll be quick to find that that 1-20 grind is far harder and longer and should be able to extrapolate that the 20-60 experience would be just as intense. Having both retail and classic cap out at level 60 then would be far more intimidating to a new player comparing the grind between the two games. Honestly if the level 120 was such a deterrent for new players to join the game then Blizzard could just increase the trial to level 60 and lock the character upon reaching that until the player subs, it takes about 2 days to do atm anyway and would give new players the idea that they have made significant progress already.</div></div><hr />

Have to ask, why does Classic, with argubaly some of the most boring, non-story centred content, have to be 1-60 with the highest level range? Makes no sense to me personally. Lower it from 1-60 to 1-30, and you get to the expansions a lot faster, and to the newer content a lot faster. Absolutely no reason now to keep Original WoW content as the de-facto standard. You are bundling 2 expanions per 5 levels for no reason, when giving the lion's share to content that is actually kind of dull with all honesty. <br />
<br />
To me? Make all the Classic scaleable from 1-30, then start BC at 30-40, and go from there or such. No reason to have a ton of crap in the old world just &quot;because&quot;. My thoughts true, but no idea why Classic/Cataclysm revamp stuff is held in high regard, if anything, make the older expansions faster as the questing is kind of shittier.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apexis</div><div class="date">2019-06-14, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I would prefer that Blizzard put a cap on leveling. The initial points and concepts of WoW were about the journey through the content and that means all the content, not just the endgame content that Blizzard and many in the community actually pushed Blizzard into doing. Which effectively rendered the world to barren with people after an expansion was all but done and over with. What was put in place to help make the world seem artificially fuller has led to people from other realm that have been less desirable, to say the least to make for a far more toxic experience over time. Though the toxicity level has waned over the last couple expansions the having to compete with resources and specialty items has turned into an utter clusterf*ck since the inceptions of CRZ's. <br />
<br />
I get Wow is an MMO, but much of the aspects of what WoW was and now seem to be have been thrown out with the baby and the bathwater over time. Today's WoW, is all about the endgame, so why pretend it is about the journey. When the actual journey was replaced with means necessary to make a horse race out of getting to the endgame content faster and faster with ever passing expansion in this game. There are more ways to divert, overcome, and literally bypass world content in less than the blink of an eye. <br />
<br />
Leveling today is nothing like it was in the various part of the game at least up to the middle of Wrath of the Lich King. If anything, Blizzard helped and condones the practice of many selling runs through dungeons, like Freehold to overcome the necessity of level through the world content continuously. True this not a new concept or practice and that is more to my point here. People don't want to level through content, they just want to get from A to B the fastest way possible. Leveling is for the casual people like me to have something to do with their time and continue to dabble in world content endlessly. <br />
<br />
I no longer raid or do PVP, I find both rather drawn out and frankly many people make both seem more of a bother than actually having fun. Far to many people use the BG as nothing more than a means to farm honor and the like. When the whole intended purpose of BG from the start were to have endless epic battles that last hours, days, and in some cases weeks. Some actually spilled over into the actual world content, which on so many levels a blast. BG's, at least the non-rated ones are nothing more than zerg fest today and queue up and move on to the next. That is not PVP, at least not the PVP that I remember enjoy for many years in this game. Ganking in and of itself went from people engaging one another to nothing more than endless griefing and Blizzard provided the means for people to literally go into another phase of a phase with CRZ's so people could hide and then pop back out and continue their endless array of griefing. Personally, if you are going to bother to gank one of my lowbie character. At least have the decency and the necessary balls to take on one of my level capped characters. Not run away and hide like a damn coward.<br />
<br />
Leveling in this game has been reduce to a point of a joke and a means of just slowing people down through world content. Blizzard needs to make some hard decisions before ever instituting a level squish. They need to come to terms with the concept of, is the world content actual content, or is it just a means to slow people down and by time to create further endgame content. If they are going to level squish, then they also need to make the world content remain relevant past things like dailies and World Quest, a few world bosses, and some rares. The only thing that makes the world at all seem constantly full of life is the annoying landscape in parts, and the habitance that wander around in that world. Otherwise once you get past leveling and questing, doing the same as World Quest or Dailies get a bit long in the tooth 6 to 8 months out. New patches of content really don't provide anymore than just the same, just more of the same, and people complaining in a month or so about the need for more content, which Blizzard itself has conditioned the player to feel the need for this endless array of content, because the content they are providing them is not at all engaging enough, nor does it have a self-life long enough to handle waiting for another patch of content that may or may not come or might be even smaller than the previous bite of content provided. <br />
<br />
When Blizzard WoW into an endgame only game in many respects, they lost the ability to make the world and that world content matter past the the leveling process. Hence why we have so many chopping at the bit for Classic WoW. It was not just the community that is being hungered for, it is the content that for many really matter the most, what kept many satisfied for months, if not years. I miss the pace of the older content prior to the middle of Wrath. Blizzard has been trying to sell an endless journey, but what they have been creating and offering is anything but a journey. It is how fast one or a group of people can burn through content, then whine, complain, or simply go way until the next cycle of content is release and wash, rinse, and repeat the process through subsequent patches, content, and expansions. The actual journey, at the least the one I got to experience when I started playing came when I was granted to the ability to fly. Once I could fly, the world and the content changed, and so did I. Blizzard with trying to make the game more livable and tolerable for some made all the content irrelevant once they put flying in the game. Though it is not just flying, it every means like heirloom to make that process less about the journey, but about the level of tolerance one wanted to give to that journey. <br />
<br />
WoW is either about the journey or the endgame, but it can't and won't ever be both, at least not in its current form. Level squishing at this point is not going to make the game a journey again and literally wiping out 60 levels of leveling is not going to make leveling another 60 enjoyable or tolerable in the least. Blizzard needed to make these long and hard decision about a decade ago. Now they simply have to live with the consequences of the game they chose to turn into nothing more than a cash cow, not a journey.</div></div><hr />

I mean, it would not be the end all if it happens, but even though I still really enjoy participating in end game content (though I progress at a much slower pace than most ), the levelling process I find actually enjoyable!<br />
<br />
If it happens, it happens. If it does not happen, I will continue to enjoy the levelling process hehe.</div></div><hr />

Lowering the level cap while expecting people to go through all the expansion is an extreme task . With the bfa stat crunch my MoP geared rogue could take on Legion quest mobs (before the crunch they'd stomp me 1v1) crunch even more and soon you'll see no power difference between a vanilla level and MoP level character, if leveling was boring before with no tangible power increases the lowering of level cap will make it worse</div></div><hr />

Leveling was meaningful before because we actually get some rewards for leveling up, i.e talent points. Now leveling is just boring process forcing player to go through contents. That's why people complains about leveling. <br />
I think Blizzard should cap level at 60, as it was the cap for vanilla. Then develop a leveling system for each expansion, such as the artifact in Legion. A similar design is the professions in the live game today. This way players actually get some rewards for leveling up and have something to work towards to for end game. New Players only need to worry about the first 60 lvl plus the expansion lvl, comparing to 120 lvl plus whatever lvl on top of that. Moreover, if players want to go back enjoy old expansions, they can go back level up specifically for that expansion. This way old contents are not irrelevant after new expansion comes out.</div></div><hr />

Once again they make the game easier for the complainers and casuals....<br />
<br />
Of those that leveled their characters toward 120 it is going to feel like blizzard will take away their progression mark my words this is not going to work.<br />
<br />
I think you fail to realize that squish is most likely going to be seamless and unnoticeable.. It will still take you the same amount of time to level to max; the leveling path will just be slightly different.<br />
<br />
And realistically you state; this will make the game easier for complainers and casuals? You already don't even have to level. You can buy 110 boosts lol.</div></div><hr />

Makes no sense to me personally. Lower it from 1-60 to 1-30, and you get to the expansions a lot faster, and to the newer content a lot faster. Absolutely no reason now to keep Original WoW content as the de-facto standard. You are bundling 2 expanions per 5 levels for no reason, when giving the lion's share to content that is actually kind of dull with all honesty. <br />
<br />
To me? Make all the Classic scaleable from 1-30, then start BC at 30-40, and go from there or such. No reason to have a ton of crap in the old world just &quot;because&quot;. My thoughts true, but no idea why Classic/Cataclysm revamp stuff is held in high regard, if anything, make the older expansions faster as the questing is kind of shittier.<br />
<br />
Because it's the base game and should be treated as such. There are two entire continents full of zones for the base game, and with the way scaling has changed the way to level there are countless different routes to take in comparison to an expansion. I can go to Westfall at 40 if I wanted to. I could go to WPL at 35 or keep it for 58. Expansions are exactly what they are... extensions to the base game. Saying that it's boring is purely opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they were to cap level and have alternate leveling mechanics (artifact, ect.), I think they should cap at 100. 100 is IMO a more round number than 60. It signals 100%, complete, whole. Then they could lop off the levels from Legion and BFA, which had alternate leveling mechanics and also scaled mobs to level so that leveling didn't matter, and leave the previous levels alone.<br />
<br />
The game can then have you go through &quot;leveling&quot; content by the ilvl of gear that is rewarded and strength of the mobs until you are geared enough to do the expansion's end content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is a meaingless argument tbh. There are two continents for each expansion you bundle into 5 levels also.<br />
Northrend and BC combined are a similar level as one continent, so only 5 levels for them, but 30 for the main game? It makes no sense. Also, in terms of questing, the base game as you call it, is 9 years old now. Last revision was in Cataclysm, so you;re basically saying that people do nearly a decade old content for a good 2/3rd of the leveling, and then jump to the newer stuff, and have to skip most of it?<br />
<br />
Nothing to do with opinion, but just in terms of questing quality, Blizz learned a *lot* since Cata, and it shows. Quests in MoP and WoD are actually pretty superior to those during the Old World so making the bulk of the game such old content with such a structure is very silly indeed, and am sure many would agree with all honesty.<br />
The base game is nearly a decade old at this point, just making people sit through that content is asinine, when they can do newer things with better more engaging quests and content.</div></div><hr />

This right here, just make the leveling from 1 to max let me choose any non current zone to level in. I should be able to get the same XP in all the old zones and not funneled into each expansion because that 62-91 grind is awful through those expansions.</div></div><hr />

I mean what is the actual point? it isn't like it's going to take any less time to hit max level. if they squish it to 60 they will still maintain the amount of xp needed to hit 120. so it's not going to save time or anything. complete waste of time doing it<br />
<br />
People constantly whine and throw tantrums about the fact that they don't get a new talent or spell every level anymore with spell ranks not being as much of a thing. So that'd probably be the point if nothing else.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adréal</div><div class="date">2019-06-14, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder if halving the levels would be too much. As in:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Classic Zones<br />
1-30<br />
<br />
<br />
Outland/Northrend<br />
29-40<br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Zones/Pandaria<br />
40-45<br />
<br />
<br />
Draenor<br />
45-50<br />
<br />
<br />
Broken Isles<br />
50-55<br />
<br />
<br />
BfA Zones<br />
55-60<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So essentially, let's say a zone would currently give you 2 levels, requiring 100K experience for the first one, and 120K for the second one.<br />
After the squish that zone would give you a single level, over the course of getting 220K experience.<br />
<br />
Talents would be gained at 8, 15, 23, 30, 38, 45, and 50. (Or alternatively they could be rounded up or down, if the aesthetic of having &quot;round&quot; numbers is of a bigger concern than keeping them as close as possible to the current system. 5, 15, 25, 30, 35, 45, and 50, for example). Death knight and demon hunter talents would end up being a bit weird due to being so compacted to begin with, which might even require gaining 2 talents per level early on.<br />
<br />
In the end though, as with all other squishes, it won't really chance anything meaningful. The power curve will be slightly less smooth, but other than that, it's basically just the displayed number that is changing, which is why I don't really mind it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) only level squish and time spent leveling staying the same because otherwise they wouldnt sell as many boosts<br />
<br />
2) they do level squish and also cut down leveling time by half. <br />
<br />
eitherway its a huge disservice towards people who have many alts just because few not so smart people are intimidated by numbers like 100 or 120.<br />
<br />
Okay, I'll bite. Ignoring the colossal false dilemma you've created there (there are many possible ways of implementing a level squish besides just those two options), how would either of those choices be &quot;a huge disservice towards people who have many alts?&quot; I see absolutely no negative impact whatsoever, and I'm somebody with more than one of each class on a single server who completed every single Mage Tower artifact challenge in Legion before the end-of-expansion AP boost.</div></div><hr />

Think about it this way, they continually put more and more time into fixing and adjusting the current game engine instead of putting that effort into building a new one...<br />

<br />
Putting it that way, everything in the game is meaningless. All the numbers. All the gear. Everything.<br />
<br />
It is indeed distressing that thanks to scaling gear is becoming increasingly meaningless. <br />
<br />
I just don't see the problem with level numbers in general. Will someone really enjoy playing more if instead of 120&gt;130 they get to do 60&gt;65? It should be about facing increasingly stronger enemies whilst growing ever more powerful, but now it's all messed up anyway. Are there really new players that are put off by the max level being a very high number instead of a low number? I would have thought that it's almost a positive thing from a new player's point of view, &quot;such wow, so many levels&quot;.<br />
<br />
I personally would probably enjoy playing quite a bit more if there were no more level cap increases at all, but rather in an expac I had to clear the storyline in a zone to get a new ability &amp; need to clear all of them to become dungeon ready.</div></div><hr />

What about your current players? At one point you had 10 millions... maybe if you had focused on keeping those players instead of always attracting new ones, WoW would be in a better state..<br />
<br />
That said, I think the lvl squish is a good idea.<br />
<br />
You are aware that to get to 10 million they had to attract more new players than they were losing, right? New players are what keep a game alive because you CANNOT have a 100% retention rate over 1, 2, 10, 15 years. The issue isn't new players vs current players because the point is to still have a game that people keep coming back to play. The ever increasing level cap is a legitimate roadblock to attracting new players and it should be addressed.<br />

I think a level squish is a step in the right direction, in conjunction with massive decrease in the time it takes to get to max level.</div></div><hr />

Amen to that. Squishing the level for Zero reason will be the last straw for many people after 15 years.<br />
(A Level squish achieves NOTHING and solves NOTHING and like the 2 stats squish that already happens just lead to these squish sooner or later happening again ruining the game even more....)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Parad0x86</div><div class="date">2019-06-15, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At this point levels are nothing more than benchmarks for sections of the game and they keep things in context making a level squish completely unnecessary and potentially damaging. There is little to gain from this but confusion as to which level 80 you're referring to and relearning which zone/instance represents which level. The current level is still low enough for anyone to comprehend so it does not compare to the motivations behind stat squishing and the squish would be an entirely arbitrary fudging of numbers. Reducing the time required to level is already managed by experience tweaking so there is no benefit in terms of that. Its a lot of effort and risk just to move around numbers in hopes that it will bring in a handful of players that for some reason might not play due to the presentation of progression. On top of that I have a feeling that the number used to represent max level is low on the list of reasons as to why WoW is not regaining popularity so I'm not convinced that that is the motivation either; the game is old, washed up and MMOs are not as appealing to gamers as they once were, especially younger ones. My favorite part about this idea is that Blizzard originally went from 5 levels per expansion back to 10 because with only 5 levels players felt a slower sense of progression and ultimately less powerful at max level. Blizzard flip flops a lot so that doesn't surprise me but overall I'm scratching my head on this one.</div></div><hr />

I don't agree. Blizzard are making too many changes to accommodate new players that the current player base doesn't like. They are &quot;dumbing&quot; down the game in way too many areas because they think new players will be turned off if they don't.<br />
<br />
I like the level squish though. But not because of new players.</div></div><hr />

No, I specifically stated I. Not a broad generalization of &quot;people&quot; Just because you feel like you were shafted doesn't mean everyone does. <br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Willias</div><div class="date">2019-06-15, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder if halving the levels would be too much. As in:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Classic Zones<br />
1-30<br />
<br />
<br />
Outland/Northrend<br />
29-40<br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Zones/Pandaria<br />
40-45<br />
<br />
<br />
Draenor<br />
45-50<br />
<br />
<br />
Broken Isles<br />
50-55<br />
<br />
<br />
BfA Zones<br />
55-60<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So essentially, let's say a zone would currently give you 2 levels, requiring 100K experience for the first one, and 120K for the second one.<br />
After the squish that zone would give you a single level, over the course of getting 220K experience.<br />
<br />
Talents would be gained at 8, 15, 23, 30, 38, 45, and 50. (Or alternatively they could be rounded up or down, if the aesthetic of having &quot;round&quot; numbers is of a bigger concern than keeping them as close as possible to the current system. 5, 15, 25, 30, 35, 45, and 50, for example). Death knight and demon hunter talents would end up being a bit weird due to being so compacted to begin with, which might even require gaining 2 talents per level early on.<br />
<br />
In the end though, as with all other squishes, it won't really chance anything meaningful. The power curve will be slightly less smooth, but other than that, it's basically just the displayed number that is changing, which is why I don't really mind it.<br />
<br />
The current expansion will still be a +10 level range, I'd think. So something like<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Classic Zones<br />
1-25<br />
<br />
<br />
Outland/Northrend<br />
25-35<br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Zones/Pandaria<br />
35-40<br />
<br />
<br />
Draenor<br />
40-50<br />
<br />
<br />
Broken Isles<br />
40-50<br />
<br />
<br />
BfA Zones<br />
50-60<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Doing this would allow people to skip Draenor, which I think Blizzard wants at this point as poorly as those zones have been maintained, and would make it so that they don't have to tweak the leveling speed of the current-most expansion.<br />
<br />
And anyone who thinks that these new levels will take as long as old levels x2 are out of their minds. This will be set up with the intent of players being able to rocket out of old content and get to the newer content as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />

Why can't they just use EK and Kalimdor as 1-40 and then 40-50 is any later expansion, you can choose to do Outland 40-50, WoD 40-50, Northrend 40-50, Legion 40-50, BFA 40-50 and then 50-60 (if thats the top lvl) is the new expansion.

Why does WOW even need levels anymore?<br />
What did we really gain from Level 110 to Level 120... we raced to 120 so we can play the end-game.<br />
We completed the zones, not to level, but cause they were there or it gated content.<br />
Even most of the zones scale to the players level... so since Legion the player level was less meaningful.<br />
<br />
The only levels that really counts in the game is Item Level and the Expansions Artifact Power.<br />
<br />
Why not just abandon character levels altogether. NO MORE LEVELS<br />

Have achievements, reputations and story unlocks (account-wide) determine the gates for content and new abilities... not some arbitrary exp count that is quiet honestly an ancient mechanism that really means nothing.<br />

Any amount of time spent leveling through the past 6 expansions is an utter waste. Too much of it is tied to story beats that never get any payoff for the typical person leveling through them. You just blaze your way through a bunch of forgettable zones, getting only a fraction of a story that is then abandoned every 10 levels. Not that bad for those of us who enjoyed the content when it was current and can get through it as efficiently as possible, but I'd hate to be a new player trying to navigate my way through so many pointless zones and levels.<br />

Squishing the levels is exactly what would allow them to return to something like the old talent system where each level gave you something new.

I've already uninstalled ALL games on bnet except Destiny 2 and in only about 2 months even it is bailing on Bnet and moving to Steam the 1 million times better client anyway so i'll be uninstalling bnet in the near future too and will never play blizzard games again.</div></div><hr />

Why do you think Cata and MoP only had five extra levels, anyway?<br />

What's so special about 127?</div></div><hr />

Sounds like a really bad computer science troll that he probably had to google to come up with. -127 to +127 is the the set of numbers 8 bits can represent but that is simply not a relevant concern in WoW especially when referring to character level. You could maybe make a case for 255 but still... no.</div></div><hr />

Hahaha... are you a troll?<br />
They are shitting us with their ridiculous item squish bullshit, and they will shitting us even more with a level squish!<br />
Because:<br />
Create a level 100 demon hunter in Legion and try to clear the archaic raid Icecrown Citadel from WotLK. You can clear it easily.<br />
Then came BFA with the new squish shit. Try doing the same and you will fail with your level 100 DH! This is ridiculous. It should be doable as easy as it was or even easier.<br />
I don't know how but they will fool us with the level squish again!</div></div><hr />

Everything? You complain about not being able to solo old raids with your lvl 100 DH that you had to spend 30 minutes to 1 hour on. I would never expect people to be that entitled that they think doing 2 levels should be enough to solo 90% of the game. Get a grip.</div></div><hr />

Why can't they just use EK and Kalimdor as 1-40 and then 40-50 is any later expansion, you can choose to do Outland 40-50, WoD 40-50, Northrend 40-50, Legion 40-50, BFA 40-50 and then 50-60 (if thats the top lvl) is the new expansion. I don't see why they have to cling onto older expansions being gradually more difficult or scale in level. It's just a story at this point, no reason to differentiate between the different expansions.<br />
<br />
There’s a difference between updating an engine and starting afresh. A big one. Generally the updated ones has better tools but suffers from performance issues. Most noticeably an inability to put too many players in one place and the way high end machines don’t affect the games performance as much as you’d expect. Lag. That sort of thing.</div></div><hr />

255 would be a better argument because for years that was the &quot;max&quot; level. But as they've shown with the HP numbers, max isn't max.</div></div><hr />

127 and 255 stem from the same problem (8 bit representation of a number set) only difference being that negative numbers wouldn't make sense for levels. Thankfully WoW wasn't developed in 1985.</div></div><hr />

Haha, all joking aside, yea it's a dumb argument, if the wow team wanted to make the level go to 999 they could, there's no real limiting number that would be reachable.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">itzLCD</div><div class="date">2019-06-17, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This would give a lot of people that are just playing WoW out of pure addiction a chance to quit. They've put so much time and effort into their characters and collections, so losing that would make them lose all the attachments to the game. So... probably not something Blizzard wants to do.<br />
<br />
I disagree with this. Imagine trying to market a game as old as WoW1 and keep in the mainstream without suffering loss in numbers...I mean they already are and it's failing. <br />
<br />
Making a new game would do much more good than bad in terms of bringing in an audience. Let's be a realistic for moment, most people who play WoW1 now would certainty try out a WoW2 even if for how little of time and knowing Blizzard would have some sort of grandfathering in strategy where old WoW1 players would get special perks or whatever to reward those who play for so long. Either way even if most verterna WoW1 players stopped playing or weren't interested in a WoW2, how would that leave them in any better spot than they are now bleeding sub numbers every expansion/month. <br />
<br />
My point being that a next gen WoW2 highly outweighs any detriments on top of bringing way more new players than it would lose.<br />
It's simply time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think about it this way, they continually put more and more time into fixing and adjusting the current game engine instead of putting that effort into building a new one...<br />
<br />
Because you would have to give up the character you spent (in some cases) 14-15 years playing, building, and living with, for a new world that may be totally different and nowhere near as much fun as this one. That's a big investment to put into something like that. Are you ready to give up everything you've worked for, and accomplished, and achieved, just so you can have flashier graphics and some shiny new stuff?</div></div><hr />

When you have this complex game which a lot of players play you want the game be somewhat accessible to veteran and new players alike. And even if lowering the levels doesn't actually reduce the leveling time, mentally it ease you in someway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although it would seem weird for someone to jump the gun or misunderstand. If the misunderstand that means that from the Q&amp;A to this point they believed a level squish was happening and prepared a survey to put out without anyone telling him. Jumping the gun means he really jumped the gun (Unless the announcement about a level squish was coming before blizzcon) and that more than one people probably had been jumping the same gun.<br />

Why in gods name do u assume those accounts would perish? Some will conti ue to play/pay. Will be fewer realms, but will be dedicated guilds so wow never goes away.</div></div><hr />

Better graphics, a new game engine, and a fresh start and clean slate <br />
<br />
Personally, I don’t think it will matter because the people ruining wow currently are the same people that would make WoW 2.0<br />
<br />
Now., if they managed to get the vanilla wow team back together and gave them a crack at wow 2.0, I’d be all in favor of it but the team there for the last few years just doesn’t get it and would fumble and stumble in the same areas<br />

Hell, why not both? Why can’t we have wow 2.0, but the pets and mounts can be earmarked to carry over like a family heirloom<br />
<br />
If the only thing holding us back from wow 2 is people wanting their collections; then let the collections be the only thing that carries over and start wow 2.0<br />
<br />
Wow 2 is overdue and if the only thing stopping it is people wanting their fluff; let them keep it</div></div><hr />
