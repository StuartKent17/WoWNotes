Developer Interview - No More Flying<br />
Polygon has an interview (http://www.polygon.com/2015/5/22/8645293/world-of-warcraft-no-flying-tanaan-jungle-warlords-of-draenor-mmo-pc-blizzard) with Ion Hazzikostas talking about Patch 6.2 and beyond. <br />
<br />
Flying<br />
<br />
The team will not be adding flying to Draenor.<br />
Moving forward, new expansions are also unlikely to have flying outside of specific zones or expansion ideas.<br />
The team will continue to improve flight paths.<br />
Being able to fly added convenience, but removed the ability to add things like targeted exploration of the world and made the world feel smaller and less dangerous. <br />
<br />
<br />
lack of flight has kept me from battering the word pet trainers and quit archeology months ago.<br />
This kind of feedback is awesome, btw - things that aren't fun in a world of no flying and need to be improved.(Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/601840708526407680))<br />
<br />
&quot;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&quot; or similar is often attributed to Henry Ford. <br />
And the point of that statement is that there are often solutions to a problem that are not always a direct continuation of what you expect<br />
So when you think about flying/not flying today, try to think about what you like or miss in specifics rather than the blanket feature<br />
Like: I miss flying because I enjoy looking at the world from a high vantage point, or I don't miss flying because the world feels dangerous<br />
It helps us when you can give feedback about the feelings and emotion you have or don't have, and how that affects your behavior.<br />
Yelling at us and telling us we're dumb for making a decision doesn't help.<br />
For example, it could be argued that the command table is a stronger tether to keeping you in the garrison than lack of flight.<br />
Try to dig past the initial feeling and reaction and tell us why you feel the way you do. That's the feedback that makes the game better.<br />
I'm heading out early for the holiday weekend. Keep sending feedback. I will always read it. (nite_moogle (https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/601868424390832128))<br />
<br />
<br />
Future Content<br />
<br />
Is Patch 6.2 the final content patch? &quot;We've got plenty of more story to be told after this&quot;<br />
The team is working hard to make sure players aren't left waiting for new content.<br />
Patch 5.4 went on for a really long time, so they are trying to balance having a shorter time between expansions and the patch release cycle during the expansion. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tanaan Jungle<br />
<br />
There will be some &quot;big setpiece quests that tell the story of bringing the confrontation to the gates of Hellfire Citadel&quot;<br />
New factions will be added that give reputation when you defend areas under attack or kill rare spawns. They offer cosmetic upgrades, player power items, and convenience items.<br />
<br />
<br />
Timewalking<br />
<br />
Timewalking is a trip down memory lane, not trivially easy, but not a way to give players brutally hard content. <br />
Timewalking could be expanded to raids, but there are still some challenges that would have to be solved first.<br />
The team wants to expand timewalking to Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria dungeons in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Flying in Warlords of Draenor<br />
Thanks for creating a thread on this. As you noted, lead designer Ion Hazzikostas mentioned in a recent interview with Polygon that we’ve decided not to allow the use of flying mounts on Draenor. There’s been a lot of debate about the pros and cons of flying over the course of this expansion—not just in the community, but in the hallways, offices, and break rooms at Blizzard—and we know it’s something everyone feels passionately about.<br />
<br />
During Patch 6.2’s development, we continued to discuss how flight would fundamentally change the way players experience all of Draenor’s ground-based content, and carefully weighed that against the benefits flying would bring to the game. Ultimately, after much deliberation, we came to the conclusion that the world of Draenor would simply no longer provide the experience we envisioned it if we were to reintroduce flight in this expansion. <br />
<br />
We appreciate everyone who has taken the time to weigh in on this topic. You’ve provided some great insight and feedback, and we ask that you please be respectful of one another as you continue to discuss your thoughts and experiences.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Art<br />
Any plans on making the epic version of leggy capes available to all chars on an account whose one har has done the quest?<br />
We have no plans to do this. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/598992554659426304))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
So..wait..you can now buy ilvl 675 gear with gold? Conveniently after you can purchase gold with real money? come on...<br />
The high pricing is deliberate to discourage their purchase in favor of crafted items or raid BoEs. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/598991661956354048))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
will the Inn dungeon quest items work in Mythic dungeons? Will 6.2 have additional Inn quests?<br />
Objectives for quests received from the Inn/Tavern can be completed in Mythic dungeons. No plans to add additional quests in 6.2. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/598554011965362176))<br />
<br />
Pets and Pet Battles<br />
Un-official poll: the next Exquisite Costume Set should be...??? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/598749136003813376))<br />
Really disappointed with the Lich King Exquisite Costume. Why would I want something else like it?<br />
Make a change to it that would make you happy (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/598751033402138626))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
&quot;spectacle creep&quot; sounds like blaming the audience for not liking your product<br />
He is blaming the audience, for blizzard failing the game. maybe he should see the out cry over the new cash mount.<br />
This is a general video about game design, how did you take this as anyone blaming anyone else for anything? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/598649630558027777))<br />
It's a video on the challenge of making continually interesting twists, as a designer, generally. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/598651046089461760))<br />
cutting content a twist? you hired 40% more workers yet still cut content, then say &quot;making things exciting is hard&quot;<br />
Sounds like that's unrelated to the video, mostly. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/598653298116145152))<br />
Making things unique after many things have been done IS challenging, but it's a very fun challenge. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/598653414923337728))<br />
No, I have a issue with you using the video as a scape goat, to why WOD was not exciting. I know I'm not the only one.<br />
I never said &quot;this video is about WoD,&quot; because it's not. Could be said about any long-run project. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/598654261023510528))<br />
I like to entertain general game design chat here, not WoW content specific. Don't assume I'm the enemy (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/598654555077758978))<br />
<br />
MoP was the most action packed expac since Wrath. Are you calling it dull so newcomers won't notice WoD is trash?<br />
Things can be toned-down without being &quot;dull.&quot; I loved some of the peaceful expanses/music. It was less explosive, but unique/cool. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/598658703173111808))<br />
Jade forest &amp; Vale explode. Krasarang is war torn. Every zone aside valley is sha infested. You have a strange concept of peaceful<br />
Each zone had some elements to it, but overall I think tended to more character pieces than usual, V4W brewery, yak wash, etc. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/598671899250458624))<br />
Regardless, it wasn't a statement about WoD, more of a general game design chat about design challenges. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/598672104809111552))<br />

Do you have a favorite site you visit for free? Do you run adblock? Consider disabling it for the ones you really enjoy. It helps them. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/598954661941383168))<br />

WoW Marathon World Record and Fundraiser<br />
Margaret (http://www.twitch.tv/MargaretKrohn) is going to be attempting the Guinness World Records for the Longest Marathon of World of Warcraft, starting Saturday, May 23rd, 2015 at 12:00 AM Central to help raise money for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (http://fundraising.stjude.org/site/TR/PlayLive/PlayLive?px=3453647&amp;pg=personal&amp;fr_id=40726). <br />
<br />
<br />
It costs $2 million dollars a day to operate St. Jude, which is primarily covered by individual contributors like you and me, averaging at around $33.00 per donation!<br />
Families NEVER receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food! They even take care of the families pets! ...Because they feel that all families should be worrying about is helping their child live.<br />
St. Jude is working to drive the overall survival rate for childhood cancer to 90% by 2020, and we can play a big part in helping fund the research involved in making this happen!<br />

This move isn't about improving player experience; if they wanted to do that, they would produce far better and far more content than what they accomplished with Draenor. This is about making development easier for Blizzard at the expense of the players, and all the people who ate up their &quot;immersion&quot; and &quot;exploration&quot; buzzwords helped them along.</div></div><hr />

I really think Flying once you reach level 100 should be allowed. If you don't want people flying in Tanaan, then just disable it there, like Wintergrasp back in WOTLK...</div></div><hr />

They could've made more zone suited for flying like storms peak or gives some zones an excuse as to why they can't fly in there (magic cause gravity here to be 3x what it was etc..). Blizz has no imagination or the motivation it seems.</div></div><hr />

Yep, take away flying for the 2 days the exploration lasts and then have 1 year+ of inconvenience. Sounds like a good idea.</div></div><hr />

Flying is boring, it makes the game lonely and you are too safe. The only thing keeping you in this game was the ability to fly? We should be able to use our current flying mounts in place of flight paths.</div></div><hr />

Part of me held out hope that flight would be enabled before or at least during the next expansion for Draenor. I don't like how we have all these flying mounts and now we can only use them in outdated areas/content or while leveling alts. I would seriously be ok with flight being added to past zones with each new expansion, while having it disabled during the actual new expansion. That to me seems like a solid compromise. <br />
<br />
And fyi, immersion is what you make it. To me, flying around on the back of a bird made out of fire, or a drake made out of glowing stone is pretty damn immersive.</div></div><hr />

It's not because i can't fly, i don't leave because the only stuff to do outside of the garrison is to farm stuff for my raids and that is inconvenienced by the lack of flying.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerofluff</div><div class="date">2015-05-23, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can understand no flying in places that have relevant content -- for example, I'd never expect 6.2 Tanaan to let us fly around. But the issue is that there is no &quot;max level relevant content&quot; in the majority of the Draenor zones. There may be a few pets/toys/etc for achieve hunters, and some mounts to go out and get as a one-time deal, but by and large there are no good reasons to keep going back into these zones.<br />
Combined with no flying, this makes a player feel like they're traversing huge empty pointless zones that you have to ride through or flight path/Aviana's around. Needless punishment.<br />
<br />
Blizzard seriously needs to work on adding more max-level content to the world of Draenor so that it remains &quot;current content&quot; worthy of us not being able to fly in it, give us reasons to go into those zones and ride around in them. Otherwise it's a senseless waste of travel time, and that's why people gripe about flying primarily.<br />
<br />
Obviously there are secondary reasons, such as flying itself can be fun... I remember back when I first got my epic flying wyvern, I spent far too long just zipping around the ravines and floating islands in Nagrand enjoying the ability to fly (and I thought it was fast back then, too. lol) It also allows you to examine the world more closely; there's been moments such as in Grizzly Hills at Dun Argol, I flew up to take a closer look at a gigantic dwarven statue that had lightning crackling out of his eyes/helmet and it looked neat. And for example with larger stuff, WoD's Shattrath is far more impressive when you're flying by it, than from a ground perspective.<br />
<br />
WoD's travel makes it unenjoyably tedious, you focus mostly on how to get from point A to point B without that same leisure of actually enjoying your surroundings ... at least, this is the case for me. Some people try to say the opposite and that most people just AFK-fly over a zone, and I admit that happens a ton. But that's because they're flying over empty contentless areas where they currently have no desire to be. THAT is a problem that needs to be fixed. Give people incentive to be somewhere and not try to skip it as fast as possible, and they'll be there. Those same people currently will just take a flight path, Aviana's, and then if they have to, ride the rest of the way kiting mobs and not stopping. Does that sound like they're enjoying the world more? It's actually just more of a hassle. This also leads to people not even wanting to bother leaving their garrison.<br />
<br />
Also, when Blizzard says things like &quot;...made the world feel smaller and less dangerous,&quot; I take it as they know they made a small world with small empty contentless zones and don't want us to zip around all of it consuming content even faster than we already are. This is really just a more subtle form of time-gating content. They don't want us to be speedy, they want it to take a while to do anything. It's a monthly subscription game, after all, they benefit more from slowing the players down.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;less dangerous&quot;... Why aren't they creative about it?<br />
Spires of Arak is filled with a race that has WINGS. And gigantic flying Dread Ravens. Give us some aerial enemies that can damage and knock you off, Iron Horde with flak cannons or skyreaver patrols, etc. Flying could have plenty of new, creative mechanics to make it dangerous and even exciting in exchange for the travel convenience, if they took the time to brainstorm. But they're clearly not.</div></div><hr />

lolwot? Flying has been in WoW since the start of TBC, we've had it in game for longer than we haven't (only Vanilla, and now WoD). It's a core part of what the game was at it's most popular time (TBC-WotLK), being ripped out, not some new feature not being added. I think it's you that doesn't have a clue..<br />
<br />
No flying is the right way to go in rpg mmos<br />
What exactly are you basing that on? From where I stand, the most popular MMORPG of all time added flying early-on, and popularity skyrocketed. Of course the expansion that removed it has (so far) seen the largest drop in players ever.... Incase you couldn't guess I am talking about WoW, no other MMORPG is really relevant (although if it helps, FFXIV is just adding flying now and it's still doing extremely well).</div></div><hr />

For the people who say that its silly to quit over this, removal of features is never ok. For the people who say other mmos are popular without it.

FF XIV is getting Flying in the new expansion (as already stated), No idea about GW2 to be honest but it's 99% focused on PvP though so..<br />
SWtoR isn't very comparable, the zones are disconnected so you have a spaceship to get from zone to zone, there is even multiple types of space-combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
No other popular MMO offers flying, so it's not the end of the fucking world.<br />

I've been playing this game for 8 years. Maybe you've been playing it for longer, or for less. Doesn't really matter. But I don't like the way the game is heading.

SWtoR isn't very comparable, the zones are disconnected so you have a spaceship to get from zone to zone, there is even multiple types of space-combat.<br />
<br />
GW2 has instant travel to pretty much anywhere on the map basically, same with rift. The only MMO I've ever played with worse travel than wow, was Lotro, but that was quite a long time ago and has probably updated it since. Most people have no idea how shit the wow tranportation system is compared to basically every other MMO out there.</div></div><hr />

My mother's dead, unfortunately. But I'd just like to restate that I've been playing this game for 8 years. Maybe you've been playing it for longer, or for less. Doesn't really matter. But I don't like the way the game is heading. The non-instanced end game content has taken a massive nosedive in quality since WoD (well, since Timeless Isle), and no-flying is part of that.<br />
<br />
Your the one sat in your parents basement getting uppity over my criticism. So fuck off, and eat more corn snacks or whatever.</div></div><hr />

FF14's expac, which launches next month (I've been betting 6.2 would go live at the same time, but it looks like I might be wrong) and they're ADDING flying.<br />

I play both, but it's more than the lack of flying that is going to make me cancel my WoW sub probably sooner than later.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard - &quot;We've decided to remove heirlooms from the game. Lots of players are skipping and missing out on a lot of content because they are leveling too fast. We think this is the right choice going forward.&quot;<br />
Internet - &quot;Stop QQing. Why do you need them? Do you want to skip content? If you do, why are you even playing this game? For alts? If you wanted alts you would have them already.

<br />
Blizzard - &quot;We've decided to not have any rare mobs in the next expansion. Players didn't find them too interesting in Draenor since we made the change to a one time kill and reward because we didn't want rare mobs to be grindy and competed over. We're looking in to other things we can do to fill in the gap they left. We'll keep you guys posted.&quot;<br />
Internet - &quot;Stop QQing. Why do want rare mobs? They were not even rare! Stupid ass players. Why should Blizz cater to the 1% that want the equivalent of loot pinatas?&quot;<br />

Internet - &quot;Stop QQing. Were you even on Mythic yet? Link your armory and prove it! Elitist ass players. Why should Blizz cater to the 1%?&quot;<br />

Blizzard - &quot;We've decided to remove transmog from the game, to make new gear models relevant again. We don't think it's fair to our artists that put in so much time into new tiered gear just for them to get trasmoged over.&quot;<br />
Internet - &quot;Stop QQing. Don't you want to support the artists? Why do you want to be different from everyone else? Snowflake ass players. Why should Blizz cater to the 1%? So you can feel special?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizzard - &quot;We've decided to drop support for World of Warcraft. We can no longer justify development time or cost for new content when WoW only accounts for 1% of players across all our games. It's been a good run, and we thank you for all these years of support.&quot;<br />

<br />
PS: I think it was intriguing the way they wanted to bring back world pvp but at the same time introduced a phased zone where you spend most of your time just commanding what adventures your followers should be going into.

This is not the case. I mean, all you have to do is look at the map blizzard themselves showed at blizzcon comparing the size of outlands with Dreanor(which included farahlon and tanaan.) So no, admited by blizzard themselves, it's smaller. Not to mention BC added 4 starting zones, + albeit small, the quel'danas. Just google it.</div></div><hr />

It's not about building a game without a feature, it's about removing something that the game has been built around for years. Yes FF XIV was popular without flying, so was vanilla WoW (although it became more popular during TBC and Wrath). The main reason so many people (like myself) are dissapointed is because we've spent hundreds of hours and thousands of gold (possibly even some cash on the store for some) building a collection of Flying mounts because we enjoy being able to fly.... and now that collection is irrelevant because some of the current devs cbf making interesting content that works with flying.<br />
Why not just remove ground mounts, hearthstones, teleports and FP's while we're at it? The world would feel even larger then.. Oh it's also to stop people avoiding mobs? guess we'll also have to cull stealth and 'run' - that's ok though, they said they wanted to prune more abilities still, perhaps 7.0 :)<br />
<br />
tldr: A game that has a feature and removes it is much worse than one that didn't have it to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's really not true though. I've been playing since just prior to TBC and have enjoyed it ever since, yet no flying is signalling a shift towards a design philosophy that is contrary to the design philosophy I enjoyed throughout TBC, WOTLK, CATA and MOP.<br />
<br />
If you want to argue flying is catering to a more casual market, well, I actually agree, but it's been doing that since TBC at least.<br />
<br />
And the new, grounded content isn't actually harder, just more time consuming and tedious. WoD's non-instanced content is substantially easier than anything we saw in TBC or WOTLK. It's just less convenient and increasingly dull.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love basketball, but if you don't lower the hoops and make them larger for me, you're elitist.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's more like they're making the hoops massive, but placing them at the end of an escalator that you aren't allowed to run up.</div></div><hr />

I'm kind of indifferent, but what you are saying is kinda dumb. I can't think of another MMORPG that doesn't have fast travel, or flying, which included wow for 8 years. So, yeah, saying it doesn't belong in MMO's is pretty stupid tbh.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Absolutely, because comparing making a basketball hoop larger and closer to the ground is totally an accurate comparison to the convenience of flying...I've played RPGs for two decades, flying didn't seem to ruin the game for anyone in TBC, Wrath, Cata or MoP. The exploration of the world is mostly done by the time you finish leveling. And at level 100, really, what end game is it speeding up? The quests are mostly irrelevant at level 100, gathering is pointless thanks to garrisons, nothing of value is lost by you being able to move across an already discovered continent faster. Flying isn't what killed world PVP...in TBC, Halaa battles were tons of fun...as were the battles on PVP servers on the Isle of Quel'danas. There simply has to be some incentive for non-PVPers to join in (rewards or control of daily hubs, etc). Those of us who enjoy world PVP aren't a large enough group to sufficiently start notable conflicts.</div></div><hr />

And they did say they'll add it to future expansions in certain zones; which is fine. Just the thing here is the lack of content that is bothersome. They gave the game so much hype and its been a bigger letdown than Cataclysm. I've been Mythic raiding. Though I've been doing work and school, I want to play. Lately when I do have the time to play especially since I'm done with school for the semester, the need to play the game dwindled to almost not playing. I'm not going to complain when I still play the game, but it's come down to the fact that they offer little to such a big story. <br />
<br />
I've noticed that there hasn't been much to offer in the PvP department. I wanted to get into it, but seeing as how they made Ashran into the zergfest that Tol Barad was and then following it up with a lack of pvp in Pandaria, they have yet to really touch on it.<br />
<br />
I'm a sucker for good lore and fun mechanics, but when you offer just pets, pay for cool mounts and just throw useless widgets and organize a few of the UI things, give us timewalking... it really shows how little thought they put into this expansion. I've already concluded that this expansion is my last. I will probably end up playing FF14 not just for the fun of it, but for the community.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ComputerNerd</div><div class="date">2015-05-23, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;While there was certainly convenience in being able to completely explore the world in three dimensions, that also came at the expense of gameplay like targeted exploration, like trying to figure out what's in that cave on top of a hill and how do I get up there&quot;<br />
<br />
Yep, take away flying for the 2 days the exploration lasts and then have 1 year+ of inconvenience. Sounds like a good idea.<br />
<br />
Exactly.<br />
Exploration isn't a big thing.<br />
In MoP the exploration acheivements were completed only by a minority.<br />
Proved that flying didn't make people explore.<br />
Exploration is driven by interesting stuff to see out the in the world.<br />
Removal of flying doesn't make that happen.<br />
<br />
This has only been about forcing an artificial environment, trying to recreate some vanilla-esque experience which was never dictated by the mode of transport.<br />
It was the community.<br />
A bunchy of whiny kids getting their own way by throwing tantrums over the fact that flying was for the most part optional, with little content which actually required it.<br />
But they complained that other players who weren't them had the option of a choice, one they didn't want those players to have.<br />
&quot;I don't want flying, so nobody should have it&quot;.<br />
<br />
So much for &quot;listening to feedback&quot; - they never intended to do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
people that like flying are newcomers that dont have a clue.<br />
No flying is the right way to go in rpg mmos<br />
<br />
Hardly.<br />
Forcing players into proximity doesn't make for a better game experience or community.<br />
It has to be because they want to be there, not because they have to be.<br />
Blizzard and players such as yourself are wilfully ignorant of that.<br />
<br />
Wow isn't an rpg.<br />
There are no real decisions that have permanent impacts.<br />
Because you have to co-exist with and be able to share content with other players.<br />
Single player games can do that.<br />
An MMO can't.<br />
<br />
Most of the content in levelling zones is relevant only for a short period for any character.<br />
After that it becomes an artificial timesink when you are forced to travel through it.<br />
Forcing players through irrelevant content isn't going to improve any community, its only going to make players less willing to search others out.</div></div><hr />

So no, admited by blizzard themselves, it's smaller. Not to mention BC added 4 starting zones, + albeit small, the quel'danas. Just google it.<br />
<br />
They didnt admit it was smaller. At all. It was bigger than OL with Farahlon. Some guy measures the zones by time taken and the WoD zones were significantly bigger.</div></div><hr />

If you take the twisted Nether out and squish them up, Draenor is bigger than OL even without Farahlon. Its maybe slightly smaller without Tanaan, but the zones arent just empty space like OL was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Flying simply makes too much content skippable. Asking for more content and then asking for flying is like 2 steps forward, 1 step back. I understand people that miss seeing things from a bird's view and I personally think this is a great time to finally make Archaeology an interesting thing instead of a gathering profession with flying mounts.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, look at Blizzard no longer caring about something that helped WoW stand out from other MMOs. Instead of continuing to provide the bar that other MMOs are measured against, Blizz seems increasingly content to instead mimic aspects of other MMOs, and not always very well.<br />
<br />
Also, flying is coming to FF14 in their next expansion. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No flying is their way to gate the lack of content by making it take longer to get to doing whatever it is youre doing in the world. That's not a good way to do business. Especially after designing mounts for flying that people paid real money for...Do you think that retarded horse would have sold if it didn't fly? I doubt it would have sold as much as it did if it didn't fly. Also flying has been a staple since TBC....the game actually grew WITH flying enabled at max level...Taking away flying didn't help world PvP...it's been dead since battlegrounds were released. It doesn't immerse people any less than not having it enabled...What a joke this development crew has become.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play the game to enjoy playing different characters with play styles that fit my mood on any given weekend or evening. <br />
<br />
This makes me an altoholic, with multiple characters on both factions leveled to cap and more in the pipeline. For me, not every area and activity have equal replay value. I don't particularly like PVP and play on PVE servers, so world PVP is a non issue for me. I want to be able to enjoy the game according to my mood and interest at the moment that I'm playing, and being stuck on rails doesn't go along with that. A flight path is simply burning game time (I'm billed by the minute that I'm logged on as a player in China) and subjecting me to the same view over and over. Flight allowed me the option to flap along and suddenly decide to see if a rare pet had spawned or head over to a favorite view. Flight paths are gaming on rails.</div></div><hr />

I seriously think you completely missed the point of his initial statement about not liking the way the game was heading. I don't either. I've enjoyed every single expansion since I started playing in early LK with no complaints worth mentioning. However, this expansion, if you can call it that, is the exception. It's aimed at the instant gratification crowd too lazy to level their professions, progress for their gear, farm for their mats, or play nice with others. No flying is just the last nail in the coffin of it all.</div></div><hr />

It's definitely the right decision from a game design perspective. Although it may be painful, there might be lots of whining on the forums and the instant gratification crowd might unsub in droves, it's still the right thing for the longevity of the game. Flying took away a lot of immersion and interaction with the game world. Good riddance to it. If lack of flying is really going to make you unsub then good luck to you and goodbye.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you so Fing lazy you can't read all the other comments that mention all the MMORPGs that DO have flying? Lol world design pointless... did you actually play TBC or Wrath at all? Storm Peaks?

Warlords of Dreanor is Blizzard's St. Anger. Hyped through the roof, but stinks on ice. Flying is WoD's &quot;no guitar solos&quot; of St. Anger - a defining part of the band's sound and content, that they omitted to jump on the nu-metal bandwagon with. The drum sound, the snare specifically, is Holinka's Ashran. The hardcore fans defend it, but even Hetfield finally admitted it was poorly thought out, and the production was a mistake. It only took him a couple of years. It only sold one half of Reload, and one eighth of the black album, despite massive hype and marketing.<br />
The similarities are disturbing...and hilarious. <br />

You'll try the next WoW expansion, and the one after that. You can deny. but we both know you will. Just like everyone else reading this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">llubtoille</div><div class="date">2015-05-23, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How exactly? I am genuinely curious because honestly an argument could be made for both sides. Just because you don't agree with something doesn't mean it hurts the game outright.<br />
<br />
Imagine a scales for every activity, where on one side there is perceived cost, while on the other is expected reward. <br />
At any moment in time we have many potential options of things we can do, which our min is subconsciously weighting up to determine the most fruitful one to actually do.<br />
A lack of flying (compared to prior expansions) has increased the perceived cost (in terms of time, gold and enjoyment - possibly through increased frustration when taking a flight path as the player is reminded that they cannot use their flying mounts) of going to a particular location. <br />
So this has made traveling a less desirable activity (compared to the other things we could be doing), to the point where for some people it is rarely worth doing at all.<br />
Thus we have the current stereotyped situation where supposedly a large portion of the player base is sitting semi-idle in their garrison (though it could just as easily be Stormwind or Orgrimmar) because they have evaluated that to be the most optimal activity.</div></div><hr />

Can't stomach reading all of it but; In the long run, what will make or break the company is quality games, not a billion dollar marketing budget. Is pretty much spot on.<br />
<br />
Also, WHERE is this savage and dangerous world they keep droning on about? Getting anywhere in Frostfire, Gorgrond or Spires is pretty damn annoying and the FPs don't really help. It doesn't feel dangerous what-so-ever. I don't really care either way but their reasons for no flying are just so darn irritating to read.<br />

But after eight months to much later the content is no longer fresh and becomes not just stale but ungodly repetitive to do on other characters. <br />
<br />
Yes, it was nice seeing shadowmoon before the destruction, yes it was nice to see gaints and ogron. I would have hoped that flying would be tied to your legendary ring but as they will not be adding it at all is kinda lame. I sorta fly with the feather I got but it lacks the control I had before. Instead of really trying to understand the why's and why not it seems blizzard would rather just remove something entirely. Should flying also be removed from older content to make it an &quot;experience&quot; again? <br />
<br />
I guess for me what really &quot;grinds my gears&quot; is they try to market how awesome the game is, instead of actually making the game awesome. With flying gone I kinda have less drive or reason play but that is me.</div></div><hr />

I do hope they offer a revamp for archaeology if that is the case. Because right now, without flying, it's one of the most painful and pointless wastes of time imaginable. AFK flightpath - ride around - reach target area, slog through mobs for 8-10 minutes - ride back to flightpath - afk flight, rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
There was already talk from blizzard they want to stop adding onto archaeology and what we have now is all we may see. Next X-pack would see it never come over to that new areas. Blizzard said they want to not keep working on new things that add just it be a X-pack thing. which means then saving money and time.</div></div><hr />

Only one raid/exp and the drops' itemlevel of the bosses will be increased from time to time until the end of the expansion and maybe one more difficulty after Mythic, the &quot;Pink-Pony with T-rex&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Whoever is leaving over some mode of transportation - a medium, that's merely meant to connect the points of interest in the game, not a POI itself - was on his way out already. These are game devs. It's naive to think they don't know ways from keeping you out of certain areas either way.<br />

I remember a similar debate many years ago, when some people argued that WoW was better than Guild Wars (1) simply because WoW allowed jumping. Meanwhile both games allowed you to venture precisely as far as the game devs decided to let you.</div></div><hr />

Wrong. I was willing to stick around and play for another 10 years, having racked up 7+ years already (played in vanilla, skipped TBC, then came back at the start of Wrath), but this proclamation is the final straw for me. I'm an explorer, a sight-seer when I'm not raiding in Heroic BRF, or running old raids solo for transmog &amp; gold, and being told NO, that a big part of the attraction of the game for me is being permanently removed in future content...<br />
<br />
Sorry but no. I hate feeling restricted in where and how I can go places, especially in current content. Is it my fault that the current WoW team isn't talented or intelligent enough to design world content with Flying in mind? Nope, and I sure as hell don't have to reward them with any further cash incentive to screw the players over any further.<br />
<br />
My 6 month sub has another 4 months on it to run, and I have 10 times the amount of gold I need to pay off the remainder of the expansion's gametime with WoW Tokens. Blizzard will likely not see another penny from me ever again. And I'm a player that owns and plays all of their current games: D3, SC2, Hearthstone, HotS (from closed beta), but the one game all of those hang off as a jumping off point is WoW. Without WoW I have less incentive to play their other games, or purchase future content for the games I already own from them.<br />
<br />
My Steam back catalogue has been piling up over the years, so by the time I finish with WoW in 6-9 months I'll have more games than will probably last me the remainder of my natural lifetime (we're talking over 500+ PC games - I'm a collector as well), so I'll not be busted for things to play.<br />
<br />
They will re-add flying in a future expansion, you can be guaranteed of that. When they're desperate for subscribers and money, and they start doing what most failing MMO's do, and start relenting on their &quot;design ethos&quot; and giving players what they actually want.<br />

Sadly, by then it'll probably be already too late.<br />

There's a reason fly and no-clip are cheats in most games, even though you can use them to get to places with a pretty view.<br />
<br />
Personally, I feel way more accomplished finding a tricky way to a hard-to-reach place than just plomping down on top of it with my gryphon. That's how we used to get to that camp north of the human tutorial. Now that I could just parachute in there, I don't go there anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree with the no flying on the basis of it removing something from the game that really didn't need to be changed. The alts leveling argument confuses me though. How so does no flying deter alt leveling? The 10 levels in WoD are faster than any other set of 10 from 60-90 (the levels with flying)...In fact, the BC flying model where you needed max level to fly seemed to work out better than the Cata system where flying was mandatory for leveling zones.</div></div><hr />

I also do not buy their argument of people pointing their mount somewhere and minimizing the gema for a few mins. What if some do? It is still better than flightpaths where you really cannot do anything and cannot stop and look at anything new after the first time.

thats dumb and ignorant reasoning, yup, lets just give players teleport hacks so they 'dont waste their time'<br />
and finish patch content in less than a week<br />
flightmaster flying should also be instant, any quest that makes you move from point a to b should be removed, because you dont play the game while moving, thats your point i guess<br />

<br />
Hello? Are you playing your game? The world does not feel &quot;dangerous&quot; to a level 100. I'm going to race thru mobs and ignore them, until one dismount me. Then I'll kill it, the handful that caught up to me, remount, and go on. And at no point will it feel like I could die. The only time it feels like it's dangerous is when I meet Tarlna or the handful of big elite, and the danger is entirely negated by going around it for 15s... except I need to go around on ground instead of around on the sky. Weeee!<br />
<br />
Does the world feel larger? Sure, it does. But thankfully, I got take a piss, make some coffee, read some website while I wait for my fly taxi to bring me close to where I want to go, instead of driving there.<br />
<br />
The redeeming feature of Draenor is that there is exactly zero reason, unless you care about apexis dailies, to step outside of your garrison. So the lack of flying is a problem, but not a major problem, because you spend so little time in that non-flying world. An annoyance rather than an aggravation.<br />
<br />
PS: Hint to devs. Players react rather badly when you remove something they earned. Doesn't matter how pure your Vision™ is, they are going to resent you for that. I think you're underestimating how &quot;awesome&quot; your ground world feels vs the shitty no flight.<br />
<br />
PPS: Keep on making more flying mounts for the store please. Each release is going to put more salt on the wounds.</div></div><hr />

The problem is the community itself. Ppl got used to get everything fast and easy, theres no interest in actually earn anything, like gear for instance. I've seen gps and guilds disband left and right. And my question is why? Because ppl don't want hard contend. They want to go there wippe 15 times and kill the boss and get loot. It's proven that most of our community lacks the skill to do the hard contend like mythic. So they will use any excuse to bash Blizz. Flying is just a way to get to a place. But you have flightpaths. And you can still fly on the other places. But like i said it's my opinon. I'm don't bother with the no fly policy i didn't fly until lvl 70 before so im used to it.</div></div><hr />
