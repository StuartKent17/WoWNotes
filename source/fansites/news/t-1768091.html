Children's Week 2015<br />
Children's Week is live and this year brings a few new changes. This year you the Green Balloon (http://www.wowdb.com/items/69895-green-balloon) is a toy that can be purchased from a vendor. The new Pet Care Package (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116202-pet-care-package) has lots of Pet Battle related items inside and a good chance to contain some costumes for your pet. The Flawless Battle-Stone (http://www.wowdb.com/items/92741-flawless-battle-stone) that is a guaranteed drop is worth several thousand gold on the Auction House, so be sure to grab it if you want some extra gold.<br />
<br />
Our friends over at Icy Veins have a nice guide (http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/childrens-week-2015) to all of the rest! Be sure to use alts to collect all of the pets. <br />

Armory Stats - Legendary Quest Line Achievements<br />
This weekend a thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1766514-Legendaries-aren-t-very-legendary-if-20-of-the-raiding-population-is-carrying-them) talking about an old quote from the Dragonwrath drop rate changes has been pretty popular on the forum, so we are doing another update on the progress of the legendary quest line.<br />
<br />
This time we are looking at the percentage of overall players that have the achievements, the percentage that have done some Highmaul (at least the first wing) that have the achievements, and the percentage that have done some Blackrock Foundry (at least the first wing) that have the achievements. Unsurprisingly, the players that raid more are more likely to have progressed on the quest line.<br />
<br />
The data used today is a sample of 6.8 million characters from 3.2 million accounts. We also did this at the end of 2013 for Mists of Pandaria, which you can see here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3644-Armory-Stats-Legendary-Quest-Achievements-Blue-Tweets-IV-Contest-Voting).<br />

Heya, any chance we could see Felblood rewarded from a garrison mission?<br />
Good suggestion, thanks! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/590412044513320960))<br />
<br />
So the seagulls hanging around the shipyard... Are they native to Draenor or...?<br />
Imported Seagulls, for ambiance. Because Varian cares, Mia. He cares about you. And your docks. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/590412924335759360))<br />
.&quot;Nice docks.&quot; - Varian Wrynn, patch 6.2, unedited. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/590413201688305667))<br />
a little reminder of home for the Alliances front line fighters against IH.<br />
You've got a long way to go until Tanaan is secured. Good luck, may the light protect you. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/590416719132250112))<br />

<br />
this is called mmochampion, not world of warcraft champion. Its a host for all mmos... but since WoW is the most popular one, it obviously gets most of the playtime.<br />
<br />
Ive been seeing swtor and gw2 stuff here all the time. And its good that its here since the GW2 guru site has some corrupted mods/admins who dont want to talk about gw2 in the chat despite the site being solely aimed at that specific game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the site IS called &quot;mmo-champion&quot;, not &quot;wow-champion&quot;. Also neither of those games have a (mandatory)sub fee, so I'd guess many people who play WoW also sometimes play GW/SW:TOR</div></div><hr />

Yeah pretty much and not surprised on the votes for rare drop from Boss.. Pretty much indicates the amount of people that want to seen as special snowflake epeeners.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IIRC there hasn't ever been a time where there was no legendary weapon? Wasn't Sulfuras in very early on? Either way, the poll isn't asking if you like legendary weapons, it is asking which distribution method we have had so far you like.<br />

When we collected feedback earlier this year the #1 request was to include information about other games.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they came in right away with MC release and MC wasn't even out with the base copy of vanilla. On release it was all dungeons that you could raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't remember that far back! The wiki says (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Molten_Core) &quot;It was one of two forty (40) player raid dungeons available upon release of World of Warcraft, the other being Onyxia's Lair.&quot;<br />

I guess it isn't out of context, just no longer as relevant? The legendary distribution model has changed since it was made.</div></div><hr />

Sulfuras came on the game's launch but if we go by tiers, tiers like 7 and 11 didn't have legendaries. But when tier 10 and 12 came class balance went mostly like this: Players with legendaries &gt; Players that can't equip the legendaries &gt; Players without the legendaries. Then came MoP when Blizz had the bright idea of everyone having legendaries ruining its value. But heck that is my two cents. People may like legendaries, some may not. The way it is handled now kind of kills the word &quot;legendary&quot;. But if I had to pick one, I guess it would be how it is handled now since legendaries are at the most trivial while the other two options are very guild dependent.</div></div><hr />

Ya know when they actually felt legendary... Now its just a grindy thing I do. Which I don't mind at all it's a nice way to gain more power. I would just prefer it if the ring and cloaks were epics. I miss the days of amazing legendary weapons!</div></div><hr />

Me too. Had all the rest done many years ago. Still need the one PVP one. Yeah - holy priest gets the flag, not that I haven't tried a number of times over the years; just not happening. Matron would be such an awesome title for me.</div></div><hr />

Use the group finder tool to find a group that is doing it. I did it years ago like this in a pre made and both sides took turns grabbing and dropping the flag in WG so others could return it for the achiev. Easy.</div></div><hr />

On my server they're on the AH for around 6k. Doesn't matter how easy something is to get, people do strange things with their money-like spend $20 for 15-25k gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the current legendary isnt flawless.. but i do like PERSONAL collect model, but it should be more interesting.. Ive been a rogue since i started playing, and i got the dragon soul daggers, it was the best legendary questline EVER! except that it was for rogues only, and that the guild had to decide whod get it first, which always causes drama.<br />
<br />
IMO there should be awsome classspecific legendaries for all classes, there should be some personal loot item collection stages.<br />
<br />
It should take time, effort and alota raiding to get a legendary. but it should also be a awsome and skillrequiring experience.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone is level 90-100 with a garrison and pet dailies unlocked, and then there are those for whom 5000 gold is pocket change.</div></div><hr />
