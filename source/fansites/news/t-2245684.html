Elemental Casting Animation Updates<br />
Thank you for providing early feedback on visual updates.<br />
<br />
We are still in the early stages of PTR - there is a lot of work ahead to get this round of casters feeling the best they can. Providing specific details about what is missing the mark and why, as well as what is working well and feels great will help us guide the coming weeks of development.<br />
<br />
There are many spell effects, animations, and sounds still being worked on, and will be continually introduced throughout PTR. Thank you for your thoughts, we are listening.<br />
<br />
What about Warlock casting animations?<br />
Our project to improve combat visuals is ongoing. Warlocks (and other specs) are being worked on, but were not ready for this patch.<br />
<br />
I miss when my race determined my animations.<br />
7.3 has a suite of new casting animations similar to our melee update at launch. Each race will retain their unique animations for many spells, while other spells will use new ones. Presently the core nuke spell for each spec (fireball, lightning bolt, smite, etc.) use race-specific animations, while less frequent highlight moments use class-specific animations, plus a few one-handed casts mixed in for differentiation, readability, and style. <br />
<br />
We agree that custom race animations are critical to keep, but also that iconic spells like Lava Burst or Pyroblast deserve a defining, class-specific treatment. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20757226462?page=1#15))<br />
<br />
Resto Shaman - Animation Update Feedback<br />
The new Chain Heal animation is actually using the wrong texture on the PTR - in a future build it will have a more thematically-appropriate &quot;watery&quot; color, as intended (similar to the particle effects you can see as it dissipates). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1066094-resto-shaman-animation-update-feedback/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20757386623?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
NamePlates<br />
Quick update here now that the 7.3 PTR is up.<br />
<br />
We're adding a couple of new options in 7.3 that can be accessed through these commands. These have been added based on feedback we've seen from the community and should assist in changing friendly nameplates where desired.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have any questions or feedback!<br />

PvP Tuning Changes Coming Soon<br />
Just a heads up - these changes are not live yet, we're still finishing up testing.<br />
<br />
Additionally, we have two small changes to add to these:<br />
<br />
Warrior - Arms:<br />
Defensive Stance now has a 6 second cooldown before you can cancel, down from 10 seconds. This change is live, and is active in both PvE and PvP situations.<br />
<br />
Warlock - Affliction:<br />
PvP Template Versatility increased by 10%. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1065863-pvp-tuning-changes-coming-soon/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20757266248?page=5#89))<br />

<br />
That's what happens when they either don't have enough time to make that many animations because they are understaffed in animators, or when they don't have enough animators to animate it, or when they don't have the budget to spend more on animation, which includes hiring more animators, or when they are focusing animation on other tasks (which is doubtful considering how few new animations we get).<br />
<br />
And that's why we get new creatures with the same animations.</div></div><hr />
