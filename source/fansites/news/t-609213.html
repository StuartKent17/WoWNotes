The same dark sorcery used to command the Scourge's powerful abominations is utilized to even greater effect in the harsh and distant realm of Northrend. Here the Lich King has focused his malefic powers on flesh giants: nightmarish creatures that make abominations look tame by comparison. Scourge minions assemble flesh giants and abominations in a similar manner, piecing them together out of body parts from numerous corpses. Unlike abominations, though, the &quot;spare parts&quot; used to create flesh giants are harvested from multiple types of fearsome Northrend giants.<br />
<br />
These living battering rams employ tremendous brute strength in carrying out the inexorable will of their loathsome master. Those who oppose the flesh giants take their lives into their own hands... and risk a fate even worse than death. <br />

Guild Bank Content and Armory Updates<br />
Recently there have been some issues with the Guild Bank contents not updating properly in the Armory. We are happy to let our players know that we have just implemented a new way of retrieving the Guild Bank data which resolves this issue and provides more frequent updates to its contents through the Armory. You can check it out now at www.wowarmory.com (http://www.wowarmory.com).<br />
