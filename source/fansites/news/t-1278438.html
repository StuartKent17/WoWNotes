Something New<br />
We've got something new to share, and we're bringing it to PAX East! If you're attending, be sure to arrive at the Naga theater early in order to secure a seat for our presentation. If you're not going to PAX East this year (or you just went a little too crazy the night before), we've got you covered -- the whole thing is being streamed live on the official PAX Twitch channel (http://www.twitch.tv/pax) at 10:00 a.m. EDT Friday, March 22.<br />
<br />
The Great Jewel of PAX East<br />
Gather your gear, heroes, and get ready to face down the Burning Hells on the PlayStation 3!<br />
<br />
Our action-packed single-player hands-on demo will showcase several key elements that make Diablo III on the PS3 so much fun, including a reimagined interface and inventory system, direct character control, updated camera, and bosses and monsters specifically tuned for console. Players will also get to experience gameplay from Act III of the campaign where they’ll get to test their mettle as either the cunning Demon Hunter or mighty Barbarian.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
We'll have demo stations available from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. EDT in booth #1036 of the Expo Hall, so if you’re in the area (and in the mood for some ritual demon slaughter), be sure to stop by and check it out!<br />
<br />
RNG is RNG: Raffles, Giveaways, and More...<br />
In addition to showcasing the PS3 version of Diablo III and chatting you up about the game as you saunter by, we'll also be giving away enough swag and prizes to make a Treasure Goblin jealous.<br />
<br />

Cross-Realm Zones and Mounts<br />
Don't think people have realized yet but the &quot;zoning&quot; issue that used to knock people off of 2 person mounts and kill them, it has been fixed. BUT now the issue has arised where I am getting DC'ed every time I'm between zones trying to &quot;remount&quot; once a zone line has been crossed.<br />
We did manage to fix the 2 person mount issue, but yes, we know there's still an intermittent disconnect issue that we want to correct as well. We know what we need to do to fix it (*crosses her fingers*) but it won't be able to happen for a bit longer (potentially the next patch). We're continuing to work to improve it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257391-nice-try-blizz-almost-there-d/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8401640294?page=1#8))<br />
<br />
The Crumbled Chamberlain<br />
Good news, we're applying a hotfix to address the Crumbled Chamberlain pieces respawn. It should be in after this morning's restarts. Pieces will then spawn in the same locations for that day, but will change locations the following and so on. This way, if someone snags the piece you're going for, it's not going to jump to a new location. You'll still be able to get it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257373-the-crumbled-chamberlain/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8197582914?page=1#18))<br />
<br />
Throne of Thunder Difficulty Feedback<br />
Throne of Thunder normal isn't tuned assuming you are a Heroic raiding guild. If your raid is still progressing through Tier 14 (say, at Garalon) it's very likely you'll be able to only kill Jin'rokh and then face a very difficult battle trying to slay Horridon or Council of Elders, though.<br />
<br />
In that case (and for the guilds still progressing through T14) it probably makes more sense to go back clear the rest of Tier 14 (which is now more doable thanks to the 10% reduction in damage and health of bosses as well as the new VP gear you can get with 5.2 Patch). <br />
<br />
Guilds that have completed Tier 14 Normal already should be able to progress through Throne of Thunder. Of course, you might not clear all of it in a couple weeks, but it's something definitely doable without getting Heroic gear from Tier 14 (gear from Normal Tier 15 is higher item level).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it's also important to keep in mind that Jin'rokh is a rather easy boss. He's not necessarily a representation of the rest of the raid's difficulty. Which is something many of you have probably noticed while progressing on Horridon or Council of Elders. And that might set a wrong expectation as to how quickly you can/should progress in Throne of Thunder. It's very possible to kill Jin'rokh without much difficulty and then suddenly feel like Horridon is a brick wall, don't despair!<br />
<br />
There are many encounters in Throne of Thunder that your raid will have to learn. And it's normal to feel things may be overtuned at the beginning of a new raiding tier while everyone is trying to better understand what each boss does and how to execute the fight properly. <br />
<br />
Not everything comes down to how much gear your raid has. In fact, you might overgear, say, Horridon, and yet be unable to progress past him due to an inefficient strategy.<br />
<br />
In any case, the developers are keeping an eye out on how things are going, and they will be making adjustments as needed. Ideally, no one should find him/herself in a situation where it looks like it's impossible to win without getting more gear and unable to actually get more gear. <br />
<br />
So, don't give up. Go get those VP items (some items from Raid Finder might help as well, absolutely) and keep refining your strategies. The boss kills will come.

I like how it doesn't cross your mind that maybe they're working on something you're not aware of. Actually, seems like that's the common attitude.<br />
<br />
Also, I love how people keep claiming it's all stars when that's been announced. &quot;YEAH BUT IT CHANGED&quot;....it's still announced and public knowledge. They wouldn't go through all the trouble of drawing in the press for a re-announcement.<br />
<br />
Of course, whatever it is, I'm sure Kotaku will hate it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure whatever it is the community will dislike it before playing it, or in your case, before even knowing what it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Swag at conventions refers to &quot;stuff we all get&quot; or &quot;shit we all get&quot;, not YOLO SWAG. It's just using the proper term for their goody bags, which almost every company gives away at big conventions. Perhaps you shouldn't take yourself so seriously?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that All-Stars theoretically uses heroes from the Blizzard games as the characters. So it has everything to do with the other Blizzard titles.<br />
<br />
Besides, it's worth mentioning that they say this will be the first announcement of this new thing.<br />
Blizzard Dota was already announced and had a trailer at Blizzcon like two years ago.</div></div><hr />

SO nothing to do with wow. Nothing to do with diablo. nothing to do with starcraft. nothing to do with titan.<br />

* They say its not an expansion, so that goes out the window for all the games.<br />
* They say its not a sequel, so its not D4 Warcraft 4, Starcraft 3 or Wow 2.<br />
* They say its not &quot;that rumored next-gen MMO&quot;, so its not titan.<br />
* They say its something that they havnt anounced before and that we are invited to be the first to see this, so its not Blizzard Allstars.<br />
* They have quite recently said that they are NOT working on any pet battle app for mobile devices, so its not that.<br />
* They say that its something different from their other games, so its not a RTS, MMO or something like that.<br />
<br />
What I think is that its some small free to play online game with micro transactions.<br />
The reason I think they are doing this is to have it as a test to see how well free to play works so that they will know how to handle Titan.</div></div><hr />
