Alchemy Items Adjustments - Oct. 1<br />
Alchemy is getting a few fixes tonight. At max rank: <br />
<br />
<br />
Battle Potion of Agility (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/279161-battle-potion-of-agility) now requires 8 x Siren's Pollen (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152509-sirens-pollen) (down from 10) and 10 x Riverbud (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152505-riverbud) (up from 8). <br />
Potion of Rising Death (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/252346-potion-of-rising-death) now requires 8 x Sea Stalk (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152511-sea-stalk) (down from 10) and 6 x Star Moss (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152506-star-moss) (down from 8).<br />
Potion of Rising Death (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152559-potion-of-rising-death) now has a 20 yd minimum range for maximum effect, down from 30.<br />
Potion of Bursting Blood (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/252343-potion-of-bursting-blood) now requires 8 x Siren's Pollen (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152509-sirens-pollen) (down from 10) and 6 x Riverbud (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152505-riverbud) (down from 8). <br />
<br />
<br />
With a hotfix that we're making to the game today, several changes to Alchemy items will take place:<br />
<br />
<br />
The ratio of ingredients for Battle Potion of Agility (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/279161-battle-potion-of-agility) has been adjusted so that the demand for Siren’s Pollen (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152509-sirens-pollen) and Riverbud (https://www.wowdb.com/items/152505-riverbud) are more closely aligned in the long term.<br />
The costs of creating Potions of Rising Death (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/252346-potion-of-rising-death) and Potions of Bursting Blood (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/252343-potion-of-bursting-blood) have been reduced. Since these potions have non-stat effects, it has been difficult to judge whether or not you should use them instead of stat potions. In practice, both contribute a similar amount of damage, but these potions are more constrained, since they are direct damage. We’re reducing their costs to make the decision of whether to use them or not more of a question of economics, rather than a question of straight throughput. The goal is for these potions to provide most of the effectiveness of a Battle Potion, at a lower cost.<br />
To complement these changes, we're reducing the minimum range required for the Potion of Rising Death’s damage effect to reach full value. It will now be a 20-yard range (it was 30 yards).<br />
<br />
<br />
In the next major content patch, Tides of Vengeance, we’re going to update the Potion of Rising Death tooltip to read “damaging ranged abilities” instead of “ranged attacks”, to make it more clear this potion is functional for casters.<br />
<br />
These hotfixes should go live very soon, over the next hour or two, and we'll have them noted in our hotfixes blog post later this evening.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 8.1 Class Changes<br />
Keep in mind this is still super early info! If the team is committed to making class reworks due to mechanical issues that Shamans, Prot Warriors, Shadow Priests, and (insert your class here) are asking for, then those take a little longer and start coming in later during PTR. <br />
<br />
Not saying anything specifically is coming but I know the team has been looking into mechanical issues with class rotations and functionality that have been raised and this is a current goal within 8.1. Just saying this to be as transparent as possible as all that has been seen is just numbers, and that doesn't fully represent what the team is working toward. <br />
<br />
TL;DR: more soon™ hopefully™<br />
<br />
Hopefully? Is that a &quot;Hopefully I'll have more soon!&quot; or a &quot;Hopefully they'll actually get around to fixing classes in this patch.&quot;?<br />
Little of column A, little of column B, but I'd reword the second part a little if it was my words of course.<br />
<br />
I say that just because you never know in development. There could be a unforeseen thing that pops up and delays this effort, so just throwing it in to cover all the bases.<br />

<br />
It's better than nothing (and free).<br />
<br />
But I'm not paying 300g for anything that I'm popping every other minute or so. We need a cheap affordable potion for mythic+'s like prolonged power was in Legion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You clearly haven't been farming properly. Riverbud is *much* easier to get than siren's pollen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even at 120 it still provides a stat boost around half of what a current flask brings with a possible uptime of 70%+ in m+. So it still provides a ~2% boost at 120, far from &quot;literally nothing&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, your math could use some brush-up....<br />
<br />
prolonged gives you 47 int for a minute vs. 900 int from the flask. Not quite half :)<br />
<br />
Don't know how that 47 translates into dps, but at around 5.5k int, it's 1%, that at 70% uptime would be 0.7%. And Int is not the sould contributor to dps, so overall, I'd say the gain from prolonged is less than 0.5% which is closer to &quot;literally nothing&quot; than you think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, now you got me a little confused. My prolonged power (https://www.wowhead.com/item=142117/potion-of-prolonged-power) gives 113 stats while a current int flask (Flask of Endless Fathoms (https://www.wowhead.com/item=152639/flask-of-endless-fathoms)) gives 238 int which I completely agree is not &quot;half&quot;, but I assume 47.4% is close enough to overlook that mistake.</div></div><hr />

Your server economy's fucked up, simple as that. There is no reason that the rarest and most demanded of both would be cheaper.</div></div><hr />

How is siren's pollen rare ? Every char i have leveled got herbalism. Siren's polen is everywhere and they even spawn the bees at a high rate which gives you even more</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except last time I checked prolonged power gve 113 int for minute. Ofc its way less than Battle Potion of Intellect that gives 900 for 25 sec but almost noone gonna chain use BfA potions for every pack when they cost 400-600g.</div></div><hr />

Rarest of the two doesn't mean &quot;rare&quot;. Failed basic comprehension test, you're out.<br />

<br />
113int (and stam) with high uptime can make a difference in m+ and also in raiding pulls where full pots dont make sense. (Early progression or farm)<br />
<br />
As for herbs. Sirens is 50g per on my server, stalks,moss and riverbud all around 20g per. Anchor sitting at 500 still.</div></div><hr />
