Why on earth would you nerf BM when it was already terrible? Or is it an oversight that it got collateral nerfed by MM?<br />
.That Kill Shot change has an extremely trivial (&lt;1%) impact on Beast Mastery. With MM nerfed, BM should get some play now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/542131895731892224))<br />
Problem is BM was already low.<br />
.It's difficult to say anything conclusive (UP or not) about a spec that only 1-3% of hunters play in raids. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/542145416301527040))<br />

You realize Gladiator is still ahead of both arms and fury on ST right? Fury is close, though.<br />
It's almost as if that was the goal... (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/542164932142190592))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Changing previous tweet: Looking for feedback on extra damage debuff to tank flag carriers IN RBGs. Too much? Too little? Just right? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/542003230557741056))<br />
FYI: In RBGs only, tanks take extra damage when carrying the flag. They do not in normal battlegrounds. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/542003498183688192))<br />
<br />
Seems like the pvp scene is lacking control of balance changes this expansion.<br />
All hotfixes aren't released at once. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/542124400447733761))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Morning Dave, is it possible to be both undead and demon? For example, Xavius died and his disembodied soul was separated from<br />
Lorewise, I think so. In game terms we choose one or the other for mechanics reasons (shackle undead, etc!) (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/542430851909173248))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Even with a barracks and level 3 inn, a person with only lvl100 followers often ends up with ZERO missions.<br />
The intent was to taper off missions as you leveled so it felt like you had to check in less, but were more rewarded (1/2) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/542193303848906752))<br />
In retrospect, missions are probably more fun than anticipated, it's good feedback, we hear you. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/542193761032228865))<br />

Mythic Ko'ragh Kill Video<br />
While we wait for a Imperator Mar'gok, we can take a look at this close kill by Avast (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/jubei-thos/Avast). An Arms Warrior point of view (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u86PSEBiRZs) is also available. <br />

I think, until they can figure a way to properly rebalance Rain of Fire so it stops getting used as a single-target ember-generator the way it was, instead of an aoe one like was intended, we may not get any. Blame all the minmaxer folks who just HAD to drop it on every fight to keep themselves that last few points higher on the meters.</div></div><hr />

Seriously? Hundreds of pages on the forums and one of most complained about issues about the garrisons and still what we get is &quot;good feedback&quot;? I'm just baffled by this. There HAS to be another reason that they don't want to fix this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Surely changing it to only generate Embers when it hits 3+ targets is a strikingly obvious way to at least bring some measure of fix to Rain of Fire, even if it's just a quick fix.</div></div><hr />

Uh, you've kinda got things backwards here. He wasn't saying that was okay or saying that wasn't related. He was saying that they couldn't read a whole lot of data since that's how many of the community use it. They've been using raid data from the past 2 weeks to decide where to go with classes. There isn't a whole lot of raid data on BM hunters, cause everyone and their brother is playing MM.<br />
<br />
Anyways,I'd say the buff they did today will outweigh the 'nerf' from a while ago by a decent margin. That nerf really was tiny.... <br />
<br />
On the other hand, nice buff to Survival. Normally 'nob turning' buffs like that don't impress me, but it's kinda clever when you think about it. It buffs Single target a bit, and AoE a lot, just in the ways that they need it, all with one single 'tweak'. Always more interesting than silly old 'Aspect of the Hawk' buffs, if only slightly.</div></div><hr />

Why do people always thinks its ONLY about destruction? We have another 2 specs that play like clunky loads of crap right now, maybe with the exception of affliction, but that is only a shadow of its former glory, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />

It isn't a flat out 20-30% buff, a few select abilities got buffed. In reality it's a ~2-3% buff for each spec.</div></div><hr />

He wasn't saying that was okay or saying that wasn't related. He was saying that they couldn't read a whole lot of data since that's how many of the community use it. They've been using raid data from the past 2 weeks to decide where to go with classes. There isn't a whole lot of raid data on BM hunters, cause everyone and their brother is playing MM.<br />
<br />
Anyways,I'd say the buff they did today will outweigh the 'nerf' from a while ago by a decent margin. That nerf really was tiny.... <br />
<br />
On the other hand, nice buff to Survival. Normally 'nob turning' buffs like that don't impress me, but it's kinda clever when you think about it. It buffs Single target a bit, and AoE a lot, just in the ways that they need it, all with one single 'tweak'. Always more interesting than silly old 'Aspect of the Hawk' buffs, if only slightly.<br />
<br />
If only 3% play a specc there is something wrong with it<br />
and its obviously the damage...<br />
And if my last Information is correct they have internal Simulation tools so how about using them?</div></div><hr />

So your saying the top 90 percent can't play? That doesn't many any sense. I agree with the statement just not in this setting. I don't like when people complain about dps when they are not getting the most out of the specs potential but we are talking top 90% which is very good play.</div></div><hr />

Jk, troll medal awarded my friend.<br />
If you are not dusting the other classes with the disgusting spec of yours it is your personal problem, but at the moment decent windwalkers easily outdps equally geared people with no effort ( if they know what to do that is), so the nerf is vindicated.<br />
Although I have to admit I would have loved others buffed to their level instead of outright nerfing them.</div></div><hr />

You have no clue what your talking about... Go check logs before writing a comment like that.. WW's monks are superior on Twin Ogrons because of their cleave. Thats it! Our cleave is OP, yes. But saying WW's are stronger than everyone else is just wrong. That says more about your raiders than it says about the WW spec.

Maybe they like the balance between ST and cleave as it is right now, but think the overall damage is too high? Either way, WW will still be above average. If you topped the charts before but don't post-nerf, it's because your guildmates are better than you but you got away with being bad by playing an overpowered class.

Where did I say he wasnt right that 2 many play mm?<br />
I said its obvious that we play mm cause its by far better than the other 2 speccs and that's why nearly everyone plays mm...<br />
<br />
But what he says is that they dont have input cause nearly nobody plays bm<br />
and that's the answer in itself<br />
if a specc is sub par Who wants to play it?<br />
so hin whole Message is kinda<br />
Well bm is bad we know but we cant change it cause missen input cause nobody plays it<br />

Your warlock is underperforming due to bad play. They are the second best casters in the game right now.<br />
<br />
It's the top 10%. They know how to play. And you have mathmatically perfect rotational simulations. If the warlock in your guild is outdpsing everyone else then that means most of your DPS are dogshite. Warlocks are by far and away NOT the second best caster DPS. Arcane, Shadow, Elemental and Balance are above all of the Warlock specs.<br />

Wrong. Check logs. Good WW's arent beating every other class no. Mythic logs that is. Seems like you havent looked into the facts either. I guess you have 1 WW monk stomping the rest of you and therefore you are presumming that that is how it is everywhere.</div></div><hr />

No, sorry, it's just stupid. You're the one trying to make what's there fit a narrative, so you can pretend to be oh so reasonable and look down on the &quot;whiners&quot; and make yourself feel good, even if what you're saying actually makes no sense. People aren't playing BM because its single target DPS is garbage right now. MM is currently an order of magnitude better, which is why people have switched to it (even if they hate its playstyle, which I do).<br />
<br />
What Blizzard are saying is that they don't have enough info about BM's DPS to buff it, but that's an incredibly lame excuse. If an entire spec is being almost completely ignored in a raiding environment, that's because there's something drastically wrong with it. Just brushing that off instead of looking into why that's the case is a ridiculous response. You can't blame the playerbase for balance problems in your game and imply it's their responsibility to help fix it. That's dumb.</div></div><hr />

Or, your guild needs to recruit better monks. Clearly, most are doing way more damage or there would have been no nerf.<br />

R.I.P WW - after last nerf they were already middle of pack on singletarget not on 4 out of 7 fight they are usless - stupid change proving once and for all that if someone wants to play on decent lv as dps the only choice is between hunter/mage/warlock.<br />
<br />
the only reason monks were doin that dmg was only because SEF and ToD on 3 fights and instead nerfing that they nerf overall - retarded change those class devs in blizz should be hanging by their balls on highest tree cause they have no clue what their aim is. and funny thing WW will still top dps on those fights so i guess even more nerfs incoming next week</div></div><hr />

I do think the reason the class isn't getting buffs is because of the 2 piece bonus for Tier 17. Are they relying on this set bonus to make the specs viable? If so, they're doing it all wrong. Even with the bonus(es), the specs will fall short. <br />
<br />
Affliction needs AoE love and more damage from DoTs (without needing so much reliance on Haunt and Drain Soul). They also need something done to help with shard generation. Being shard starved all the time is not fun. RNG shouldn't be an intricate part of our damage. Also, our pet shouldn't be our top damage. Right now, it is and that makes me sad as an Affliction Warlock.<br />
<br />
Destro needs AoE love and better Ember generation. The nerfs lately killed this spec. Fix it without making Rain of Fire part of the single-target rotation. Destro also suffers from the pet being their top damage dealer. <br />
<br />
Demonology needs to not be so damn clunky. Also, I don't like Metamorphosis. It's not fun and the constant switching back and forth just isn't my cup of tea. I want to command demons, not be one. But that's just my opinion. If other Warlocks like it, that's great. It's just not my thing. :) <br />
<br />
<br />
Locks need some love and a set bonus shouldn't be the reasoning behind the lack of buffs we sorely need.</div></div><hr />

I think people who don't play a warrior themselves think that we can still be very tanky in glad. Some people also think shield = no dmg, maybe Lone Wolf hunters should also be a dps decrease because you loose the pet?;)<br />

<br />
I don't play a Warlock and I never have, but current rankings are showing Warlock DPS at 20th, 23rd, and 24th place for their specs out of 27 DPS specs. The only class currently as low as them in every spec are rogues. The highest Warlock spec, Destruction, is only doing 89.2% of the damage that the top spec (Frost DK 2H) is doing.<br />
<br />
With BiS gear Warlocks do increase, but still only place 11th, 14th, and 18th, with Affliction coming out top.<br />
<br />
They are currently the worst casters in the game at the moment.</div></div><hr />

The leadership of Acti-Blizz holds their player base in contempt, it seeps down from there. People emulate their employment supervisors to appease them and hopefully get ahead, especially true in a corporation the size of Acti-Blizz.<br />
