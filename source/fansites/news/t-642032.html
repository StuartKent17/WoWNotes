While they are at it... they should add a 2nd Paperdoll for the gear.. so we don't have to dedicate slots for the swap-gear... it can take up 16-18 slots if you have a complete set to change into.</div></div><hr />

There are like 3+ equipment add ons that have been consistently updated and functional after every patch. Probably written by kids sitting in a basement. I'm just curious, if they can do it...why cant Blizzard?<br />

With WotLK, Blizzard have shown they want to increase bag space, by moving certain items into other locations (such as emblems, stone shards etc). Why not add an additional paper doll to the character frame, so we can place our secondary gear where it will be eventually anyways?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Blizzard typically adds new APIs to the game client itself to facilitate features like this. Add-ons need to sort of hack around limitations in the client. True, they get it accomplished, but not elegantly. Blizzard is heavily modifying the APIs around item management in order to cleanly support this new management system. These changes greatly benefit the add-on authors as well, as they can refactor their code to make use of the improvements.<br />
<br />
However, any API changes to the client must be highly tested. If those APIs also require server-side changes, the potential issues are magnified further. From a software lifecycle standpoint, this new feature represents a great deal of effort on their part.<br />
<br />
The independent add-ons will still be updated and will work while we wait for this feature to be released. In the meantime, just be aware that adding a new built-in feature to the game is NOT the same thing as just writing an add-on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And all three of those addons have been around for more then a year receiving regular updates. You expect Blizzard to duplicate all that in just a few months?<br />
<br />
Plus, all of those addons are Lua only implementations storing their information in the saved variables. Blizzard's system has to store it server side, which means development within the game's own Lua UI, changes to the actual client software, and changes to the server software &amp; Database. If an addon has a bug, it's a simple procedure to release a fix. If something in WoW has a bug, they have to go through a complicated patching procedure that can take weeks.<br />
<br />
This is why Blizzard doesn't make a lot of changes to ingame UI, it requires a LOT more work compared to what the addon devs do.</div></div><hr />

[i][b]Outfitter or<br />
ItemRack<br />

These are excellent addons that do the same thing for now. You can also dowload from the WowMatrix client.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The add-ons in question here don't violate any of the new terms. Donation boxes were pulled globally from the Ace framework, and that was probably the only questionable thing here. Personally, I'll still be using Outfitter even when Blizzard does release this, because it does all kinds of automatic scripting and stuff that we'll never see in the built-in version.</div></div><hr />

No.<br />
Noblegarden is in 3.1, but it will be delayed because 3.1 won't be out in time for the normal... time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Helior</div><div class="date">2009-04-04, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With at least 3 brilliant equiptment management addons, all of which offer more functionality than blizzards implementaion, it seems to me like blizzard are wasting alot of resources and achieving nothing. It is clear that they have embraced addons full on, i mean they have admitted to tuning content based upon them for example. It seems like an odd move on there part to me.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milkman</div><div class="date">2009-04-04, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like they are trying to get it out next week.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree, i disagree with those that say them postponing noblegarden means the patch is going to be delayed also. I think it's coming out this week they have stopped testing on everything and both of the last 2 patches have been nothing more than bug fixes. Also they might be delaying noblegarden to make the 3.1 pa5tch go smoother as they may realize that there will be hotfixes needed the week of 3.1 release. Signs are pointing towards this tuesday imo.</div></div><hr />

..what are you talking about? Diablo 2 didn't have full gear swapping, just weapon/shields swapping...</div></div><hr />
