PTR 3.2 - Build 10128<br />
This is a minor build and most of the changes were in the Patch Notes update posted this morning.<br />
<br />
New Halloween Masks!<br />
I joked about that in the original post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=79546.0) but I didn't realize that Blizzard would actually add new masks in the next build just to create some confusion. Oh well, new Halloween masks have been added to the game in addition to the Goblins and Worgens masks from the previous build. <br />
<br />
This update doesn't change my view on the new races of the expansion (Goblins and Worgens) but I'm sure tons of people will be happy to discuss this addition. I'm not getting naked (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=79546.msg1169037#msg1169037) yet. <br />

PTR 3.2 - Patch Notes Update<br />
The official patch notes have been updated once again!<br />
Wintergrasp<br />
Industrial Warfare: This achievement has been removed.<br />
To provide players with a more transparent notification of when Wintergrasp battles occur, as well as better control zone population and stability, several changes have been made.<br />
The queue will accept up to 120 players from each faction, resulting in a maximum battle of 240 players at a time.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br />
Blood Strike: The bonus damage this ability receives from diseases on the target has been increased to 25% per disease.<br />
<br />
Engineering<br />
Increased siege damage caused by Saronite Bombs and the Global Thermal Sapper Charge.<br />
<br />
World Environment<br />
Wolvar and Gorloc orphans have arrived in Dalaran and need your help! Players can find out more by visiting the Eventide District (completing the quests being offered for this event will not count toward any Children’s Week achievements). Players have a limited amount of time to care for these orphans before they take their leave. They will then return again for the regularly-scheduled Children’s Week next year. <br />
<br />
PTR Raid and Dungeon Testing (July 21)<br />
Here's the current schedule for Trial of the Crusader PTR testing:<br />
<br />
On the North American test realms:<br />
<br />
Anub’arak - Tuesday Night, July 21, starting at 7pm EDT. Normal and Heroic.<br />
<br />
On the European test realms:<br />
<br />
Val'kyr – Wednesday Night, July 22, starting at 19:00 CEST. Normal and Heroic.<br />
<br />
Some of the tests will have multiple bosses and difficulties available for testing, as noted above.<br />
<br />
We’re going to try and have Test Patchwerks (Tank and DPS versions) available in the Argent Coliseum for testing. Instead of the previous tank test patchwerk that increased melee damage over time, the 3.2 tank test patchwerk will just hit VERY hard (as hard as Algalon) all the time to allow for more lengthy sustained tank parses. We're always interested in seeing combat logs and parses for all raid testing on the PTR, but especially test patchwerk logs. These are extremely helpful to our class team.<br />
<br />
This schedule could change at a moment's notice due to server, bug, or patch status. I'll try to keep everyone informed as much as possible. The Trial of the Crusader and the bosses to be tested will remain also open a variable length of time. How long they stay open depends upon a host of factors including designer availability, bug status, etc. These bosses are very much a work in progress, and this is a test server.</div></div><hr />

I must agree with this, if you look at the worgen masks for example they are done much better + that they still made the female worgen model from scratch (meaning there is NO female worgen models ingame and has never been, except this new mask).</div></div><hr />

I don't know what to think now. <br />

But the quality of the female orge mask is really bad, as are the quality of all the new masks except the goblin and worgen masks, feels more like a hasty cover up (the quality of the new masks are crap) from blizzards side.</div></div><hr />

There hasn't been a single female ogre in game ever, I thought they were asexual up till now.<br />
<br />
Vykrul wouldn't be a race because they're unevolved humans and alliance races have too many humans as is, besides if anything you would think the Vykrul would join the Horde out of hate for puny humans. (Although all Vykrul are jerks in game so...I doubt this would ever happen).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not necessarily a cover up, I think it's a well planned hype for blizzcon and the new expansion. I doubt they would fuel the fire if there wasn't some truth in the two new races theory.. Looks more like a confirmation to me, but they want the discussion to go on..</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason i do not believe the goblins will be a playable race is because they will not reveal the 2 races at the same time, just as they did with TBC. They announced Blood Elves, a few months past, people speculated, and then they revealed the Draenai.<br />
<br />
I'm almost absolutely Certain that both of the playable races are now up there, and it is simply a teaser to keep us guessing. So its Worgen + Something that ISNT goblins.<br />
<br />
However, unfortunately im not confident enough to say ill run through the streets of a capital city naked. The small % that i believe i could be wrong is too much of a risk for moi xD</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason i do not believe the goblins will be a playable race is because they will not reveal the 2 races at the same time, just as they did with TBC. They announced Blood Elves, a few months past, people speculated, and then they revealed the Draenai.<br />
<br />
I'm almost absolutely Certain that both of the playable races are now up there, and it is simply a teaser to keep us guessing. So its Worgen + Something that ISNT goblins.<br />
<br />
However, unfortunately im not confident enough to say ill run through the streets of a capital city naked. The small % that i believe i could be wrong is too much of a risk for moi xD<br />

Blood Elves(not High elves remember, this is after the sunwell was destroyed) Helped the alliance with getting rid of the scourge on Lordaeron, That makes them Alliance, Amirite?Your statement is still incorrect<br />
<br />
Also, regarding Blood/High Elf:<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Blood_Elf<br />
The blood elves (a.k.a. Sin'dorei, which means &quot;children of the blood&quot; in Thalassian) are a race composed of former high elves who renamed themselves in honor of their people that were killed during the siege of Quel'Thalas by the Scourge during the Third War.<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/High_Elf<br />
The high elves were once a significant force on the continent, but in recent times their numbers have been dramatically reduced, 90% of their race having being slaughtered in the Third War. Following this, another 90% of the survivors changed their name to &quot;blood elves&quot; in remembrance of their fallen brethren, and no longer consider themselves high elven. Around 25,000 true high elves remain, those of whom cling to the Alliance trying to restore the glory of their once great people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard has tweaked the lore to serve their purposes before, I never thought Elves of any description would consider joining the Horde, or the Horde consider having them. But they did.<br />
<br />
Goblins built all the zep towers, and would have the most to sell to the Horde seeing as they don't have an engineer race like alliance do, and if you remember there was an interview when the original four races were released, the developers wanted Goblins to be a Horde race because they fit. They didn't because they thought it would be excessive to have each faction with a short engineering race.<br />
<br />
So I wouldn't rule out Goblins, even if it is an alliance of convenience like Undead and Blood Elves, they could easily join the Horde for the opportunities it would provide.</div></div><hr />

If they make ogres or vrykul playable, then they're making worgen and goblins playable, and they're not gonna add 4 races at once in one expansion. Only 2 max. Either they are a cover-up, or Blizz really is just adding more halloween masks. Although I find it really unnecessary to invent female versions of halloween masks for npcs that do not exist in game in female form. The most logical is either it's a cover-up or it's just to throw us all off of their real intensions.<br />

<br />
You can definitely tell the amount of effort that went into the Worgen masks. They are incredibly detailed, high resolution and both of them are brand new textures. This leads me to believe that there is enough of a reason from a design standpoint, to warrant the time from the art department to make something that good. With how obvious it has been lately that Blizzards development/art teams have been shuffled around to other projects (3.2 is the example), I highly doubt they're willing to spend the time making masks for Halloween masks so detailed and unique.<br />
<br />
The same does not reflect on the female Ogre mask (the only one, aside from Worgens, that didn't already exist) To me, it looks absolutely terrible, and you'd have to be blind not to notice the difference in texture resolution used for that mask compared to the rest. Male Ogre's and Male/Female Vrykul high res textures already exist (It's not hard or time consuming to reshape an existing texture around the shape of that mask). <br />
<br />
It's pretty obvious to me this is an attempt at a cover up. There wasn't nearly the amount of time dedicated to making that female ogre mask, as there was for the Worgen masks.<br />
<br />
Swing and a miss Blizzard. You make a great game, but you fail at cover ups.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizz knows that we dig in game files. They will do whatever it takes to hide their new additions to the game as long as they can. when they announce the new races and new hero class I wonder what people will do? haha<br />
<br />
Blizzard also has an amazing marketing team. Putting things like this for people to find does absolutely nothing but stimulate discussion and interest around the game. I have a feeling that Blizzard is seeing a drop in subscriptions because of their recent decision to continually recycle content, they also know that WoW is at a point where nothing is new and fresh. <br />
<br />
Simply put, they need to keep people interested so they injected these textures into the game files for that reason alone.</div></div><hr />

Doubtful. I think the suggestion that Goblins/Worgen will be able to choose a side is the most plausible.<br />
<br />
I think we're going to see a severing of some factions (I think Jaina will disband from the Alliance, and Garrosh from Horde), but I doubt they'll be playable.<br />
<br />
The fact that both sides have the exact same &quot;civil wars&quot;, leads me to believe something like this is coming (what happens on Alliance, must happen on Horde, from a balance standpoint. Think reptation gains ;).</div></div><hr />

PvP to PvE transfers will never be allowed.<br />
Was to fix so that PvE servers with high population can move to PvP of low population to help even it out servers (and opposite changes of course)<br />
<br />
<br />
Race changes will never be allowed (well, faction, but whatever).<br />
Same as above, to help servers with 4:1/1:4 ratios.</div></div><hr />

No one in this thread has the right to say, &quot;This is NOT going to happen.&quot; <br />
<br />
Because Blizzard has changed their mind before. You don't know if they will again.<br />
<br />
Guess what........It's not going to happen.<br />
<br />
You know why? It will kill lore when you decide to make a neutral race and then decide that this race should be on this/that faction. Please don't tell me that you fools think that all goblins are neutral.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unholyground</div><div class="date">2009-07-21, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm also curious as to why Blizzard made the mask embedding around the edges smaller than on the Worgen and Goblins. That just screams that they were rushed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya, They may have even intended to put them in all at the same time but may have fumbled it somewhere along the line. And just the fact that the Worgen has a female and new male look makes it a positive as a new race in my books, you don't put that much effort into an upgraded look to a race in the game (even if its a Halloween event mask) for nothing.</div></div><hr />

The edges are different and very blocky and there is a lot less blending on the edges. And of course the quality is just sub-par comparatively.<br />
<br />
Leaning towards a hoax or planted by Blizzard to mislead. Can we get someone else to verify the presence of the textures in this patch?<br />

Could be legit or placeholders until Blizz updates. Still hard to say.</div></div><hr />

Again.<br />
<br />
YOU don't know what Blizzard is going to do.<br />
<br />
YOU have no right in saying it's not going to happen.<br />
<br />
You can state your opinion that you don't think it will happen. But you can't say it WILL NOT happen. Or are you failing to understand what I'm saying?<br />
<br />
And lore hasn't stopped Blizzard in the past, or have you forgotten about the Draenei? <br />
<br />
If they took a neutral race (Goblins) and decided they go to this or that faction, they could say a cartel of goblins decided to allow themselves to be employed under that allegiance for profit.<br />
<br />
Not all Goblins are neutral, no. But Steamwheedle Cartel is -- but guess what? That's one cartel, out of what, five? Who's the say one of the others couldn't decide to hire themselves out to the highest bidder?</div></div><hr />

I think he meant to say that we're fools if we don't think all goblins are neutral.<br />
Some goblins blew themselves the fuck up during wc2 in the name of the horde. Did they make some kinda eternal pact to always remain Swiss from that point on or something?<br />
And there's goblin factions we haven't seen yet, ones not yet introduced in the game.</div></div><hr />

I can honestly say it seems blizzard just trying to cover thier tracks. They redid the entire worgen male model and made a detailed Female model. They kept the same looking Ogre male which looks like a crappy screenshot and plastered some 2D image on for the female Ogre. The rest of the masks have the same old models and dont look nearly as good as the goblin and worgen. Only one that comes close is the Vykrul, but ofcourse those are new to the expansion anyway so they should have better detail. This is my honest opinion but it also could be blizzard just trying to cause confusion, or they could all just be new masks. The possibilities are endless :O!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Did they state that like they stated PvE to PvP transfers would never happen?<br />
<br />
Did they state that like race changes would never happen?<br />
<br />
Did they state that like Horde Paladins would never happen?<br />
<br />
You see where I'm going with this. You can't rely on Blizzards past statements because these games change so much. You also need to realize Blizzard is a business, and they'll do whatever will win them the most subscriptions. Adding in 2 of the most sought after and requested playable races is a good start, how about letting those (naturally neutral) races pick what faction they'd like to be? It works from a lore standpoint, and a business standpoint. Goblins have been known to choose sides when they have to (there are several instances of this). Who's to say that there isn't a looming threat on The Undermine, and Goblins are being forced to stand up to said threat? Nobody really has a damn clue about Worgens, so Blizzard can get creative here.<br />
<br />
It is plausible and you'd be retarded to disagree. This isn't saying it's going to happen, but to deny the possibility is absurd.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has broken lore, and done things they said would never happen on multiple occasions. What makes this the exception? Because you say so? Lol, ok kid.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly what I've been hinting at, but there's apparently a lot of close-minded people here.<br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is, having two new races that can choose their faction would bring in a lot of attention for more subscribers. I have several friends saying they'd try the game/come back to the game if Worgen are introduced, and even more so if they can make them play on the same side as I.<br />

It'd surely keep a lot of people playing the game longer, that's for sure.</div></div><hr />

I'd completely agree with you, the fact that they can learn which faction they like better would bring a lot more players to the mix of the game.

Once again, I would completely agree. It's gonna cause a huge spike of new players as well as the fluxuation between the two factions is going to even out on MOST servers.

Space time flux causes a 10 year leap. WoW players are disgruntled over the one yar push back of Blizzards third MMO involving more lore breaking. WoW players all ban together and take control of the nuclear systems all over the world. We demand blizz make a new game within 6 months that is better then WoW. They refuse and all blizzard HQ's are wiped off the map.<br />

Yep! See, I play on both sides, so for me, it isn't really an issue anyways. I've just been stating to these close-minded people that are apparently afraid of change what could possibly happen (and what would make Blizzard the most money, in the long-run). All I get is a lot of 'no u' and 'that's never going to happen'. Close-mindedness isn't very attractive. ;P<br />

Oh yeah. I have a feeling that Blizzard released the masks early on purpose...and then released a bunch of crappy ones to stir up even more shit.

I mean seriously the Lore behind Chuck thats been spewed into barrens chat has been collected by blizzard servers over all these years.

It makes perfect sense that he was summoned into wow by the Burning legion but Chuck doesnt like when ppl tell him what to do so he sides with the Horde or Alliance (cant determine yet) Another way is that during a Kung Fu demonstration his Round house kick ripped a hole in time and space and the Real world started to leak into the emerald dream (causing the Nightmare) or is actually the one responsible for the Sundering (again cuz Roundhouse kick is OP)<br />
and hes here to save the world. As for the Pandaren, Blizzard had a panda bear for the collecters edition of Vanilla WoW. After so much QQ about current ppl not getting pandas they are making a panda race in thier attempt to further scrubify the game and please the noobs.<br />

<br />
You will be able to change factions depending on what races are available that can be your class on the other side (ie: Humans, Draenei, and Dwarf Paladins must choose to be Blood Elf Paladins) NOT &quot;oh I'm now a blood elf for the alliance/ a dwarf for the Horde.&quot; So I don't see how people think just because Worgen and Goblins have been only Neutral/Hostile up until this point in World of Warcraft (Goblins were Horde in Warcraft 2) why they would allow them to choose their faction within their race, if they'll even be a playable race to begin with.<br />
<br />
Excuse me but I might be mistaken, you ALREADY can choose what faction to play on when you create a character. You're just limited to the races from each faction that are available.<br />
<br />
You amalgamate each faction enough (the way SOME of you guys want), and then you'll just play one big faction with all the races, and there will be no conflict.</div></div><hr />

I already told you I know how the god-damned faction change works.<br />
<br />
I said they'd work hand-in-hand. Just because they don't essentially DO the EXACT same thing doesn't mean they don't work well together, for the love of god.<br />
<br />
And who says that would happen? So, there would be two races that can choose their faction. It could open the doors for a third possible faction, or for more choose-your-faction races, rather than choosing a race that belongs to one faction. There would still be two distinct factions, but just because there's the same races on either faction doesn't make them the same faction.</div></div><hr />

Screw worgen, Screw goblins, The super Human chuck norris race is def in the exp. No one would see it coming i mean come on ppl it makes perfect sense. Someone had even linked the super secret holloween mask (Which i think contends with the detail of the Goblin and Worgen ones)</div></div><hr />

EQ1 didn't have it (you could gain or lose faction with individual races, I believe). But EQ2 did.<br />
<br />
Betrayal quests would be interesting, but would probably be pushing it for now. <br />

Although I really don't see the problem with neutral races picking whichever side the individual wants to be on. It's not /that/ far of a stretch.<br />

The only one I can't see (though I would kill for) are the Naga...not because they're evil (anything sentient can betray their race if they really feel the need too), but because of the armor models.

Personally, I'm not really sure how the Worgen fit into either faction, as they've never shown anything but hostility in lore, but they're wildly popular for whatever reason so I guess Blizzard will make it work.<br />
<br />
Goblins on the other hand make total sense to me, even if it's just for Horde and not this mythical faction-choose gimmick. People who say Goblins must remain neutral are -obviously- forgetting that race does not equal faction. Ratchet is friendly to everyone, but Venture Co. is hostile to everyone. This applies to nearly every race in the game, especially the playable ones.<br />
<br />
Breaking it down...<br />
You play as Thrall's Orcs, not the Blackrock Orcs or Fel Orcs.<br />
You play as the Darkspear Trolls, not the Amani or the Drakkari or the non-Darkspear Jungle Trolls.<br />
You play as Thunder Bluff's Tauren, not the Grimtotems.<br />
You play as Silvermoon's Blood Elves, not the ones loyal to Kael or the High Elves.<br />
You play as Ironforge Dwarves, not the Wildhammer or Dark Iron.<br />
<br />
There might be examples from the other races, but I can't recall all of them, and I've made my point anyway. Goblins were in the Horde in WC2, and Gazzlowe was a big aid to them in WC3 as well. Goblins made the Zeppelin Towers and most of the Horde's technology, which is obviously not the same construction style as the Alliance's. I already pointed out the difference between Ratchet and Venture Co. In WC2, the Goblins were depicted more as crazy types who loved exploding things, than as greedy businessmen. So it's not beyond the realm of possibility that a faction of MILITANT rather than business Goblins could have remained loyal to the Horde over all these years, and are now representing themselves as we get to their home town.<br />
<br />
Also, while Goblins as Horde makes sense to me, there's one thing that's gonna be awesome about rolling a goblin...<br />

Did you even look at the masks? Did you even notice how much time was put into the Worgen and Goblin masks? Did you even see the horrible female ogre mask? They're trying to hide up the fact that we found them out. They did this to trick the ones data-mining hidden treasures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's actually a pretty good idea. Would you get thrown onto a random side, or would you pick which side you wanted to join? <br />
<br />
I think a third neutral/mercenary faction could work without too many issues, honestly. World PvP? Pick a side and you become red with the other. Same for BGs. The only problem I see would be quests... Seeing as you'd likely would be able to do almost all the quests in the entire world... so that could be an issue for people who wanna whine about achievements. But then, I doubt it'd be too much trouble to smush Horde and Alliance achievements into one (quest-wise, anyways).<br />
<br />
That's actually about the only thing I see being a potential issue with a Mercenary/Neutral faction...is achievements.<br />
<br />
....<br />
....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...Where DO the boots go?<br />
<br />
<br />
Well what I meant by pants, for the naga...is maybe a single wrap around their waist.<br />
<br />
The ones you can put on them in the model viewer are just kinda repeating pattern down their tail. I could see pants for naga being a waist wrap of similar pattern to how the pants look on other toons. As for boots... trolls, tauren and draenei have ankle-wraps. So Naga could have tail-rings.<br />
<br />
I just meant that they don't have legs or feet at all, so it would pose a minor issue to the lazy Blizzard employees. :p<br />

It is. It's going right along it's MMO career.<br />
<br />
IMO, Blizzard will probably want to do new and unheard of things to draw more attention back to the game. Neutral/Mercenaries/Choose-your-faction races really isn't that much of a stretch, I don't know why people are making such a fuss over a few people just suggesting the possibility of it. It's not like we're saying that's what's going to happen.</div></div><hr />

Look at the edging of the Worgen/Goblin Masks compared to the new ones. The new ones have a white lining. Furthermore if you look at the shape of the masks you will notice that there are subtle differences.<br />
<br />
Border is also a different size and the actual texture of the model it represents continues onto the bordering on the new ones. On the Goblin/Worgen masks, the texturing does not continue onto the bordering but is instead a flat colour.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On topic, I think 4 things are likely with the masks:<br />
1 - Goblins and Worgen are the new races, and these later masks are a quick attempt to cover the slip-up.<br />
2 - Goblins and Worgen are the new races, and their masks were intentionally released first to get a flurry of speculation and debate going<br />
3 - No races, but new female masks for races without them (Murlocs, Worgen, Ogres) means that those NPCs are getting a graphical makeover with female models added.<br />
4 - No races, Blizzard just likes masks.</div></div><hr />

And it is strange that they added them seperately from the newer ones. The addition of these masks make me think that these are even more likely to be the new races.</div></div><hr />

But what if they were part of this new faction? :D<br />
<br />
Personally, I still prefer the idea of choose-your-faction races for neutral races...at least that's the least complicated of the two ideas people have been flinging around.</div></div><hr />
