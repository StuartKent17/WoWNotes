Patch 6.2.2 Downtime<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Racials<br />
Did they forget to buff Touch of the Grave? Its still doing the same amount of damage it was before the patch.<br />
We'll look into it. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/638778180967473152))<br />
<br />
Bugs<br />
what's up with bladestorm? Animation is borked since 6.2.2. Dwarf. Spins once and then stops moving at all until it's complete.<br />
Thanks, I'll pass it on. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/638784535212261376))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
why would you nerf anything when it comes to teams that qualified already on a different state of the game? makes no sens<br />
As stated before, we will do what we feel is right for the game but try to accomodate timing when possible. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636340716348702721))<br />
Good players adapt and overcome to shifts in a game's meta. This is the nature of esports. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636340824276512768))<br />
<br />
to change the game a lot after the qualifiers for regionals,all the teams are locked and vulnerable to nerfs<br />
I can't speak for other games. We are only concerned about doing what is best for World of Warcraft. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636356378626363392))<br />
Last year there was a new patch before regional's &amp; I believe they played on the old? #Blizzcon<br />
Incorrect. We stayed on Mists for Blizzcon. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636564473071857665))<br />
you are mistaking Regionals for Blizzcon. 6.0 came out after regionals, before Blizzcon. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/636571169009700865))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Developer Communication<br />
but having something like that even once every few weeks makes a huge difference.<br />
I don't know that I agree. On WoW, it might make the paladins happy but then the shaman wondered when it was &quot;their turn.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/635965210180718593))<br />
I can see that issue. I'd still rather 'somebody' got a turn than nobody. My view may not be consistent with forums overall<br />
If you have say 20 devs engaging it may not be an issue. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/635967340035764224))<br />
And I have been at two of the largest studios out there, which couldn't produce 20. But I can dream! (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/635967603236671488))<br />

Poll - Flying Achievement<br />
Now that flying is here, it is time to see how many of you are ready to fly! We last looked at this (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5089-Armory-Stats-Flying-Achievements-August-14-Hotfixes-Blue-Tweets-HS-TGT-Cards) a few weeks ago and it was a pretty even split.<br />
<br />
Stats on the overall number of players that have earned the achievement are coming within the next week or so.<br />

Really? How much do the mounts cost? o0<br />
<br />
That sucks.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just read that it's 5000 per mount so about 1000 boss kills. Like 250 dungeons :/<br />

flying restrictions are down, that's the only thing that concerns me.<br />
2 hours is enough.<br />
<br />
Actually there is one other thing that changed : amperial constructs (spawns at the garrison with mage tower / spirit lodge) now teleport people instead of walking veryvery fast - which is nice. <br />
<br />
Yet, There is no more blue &quot;rainbow&quot; and no more blue portal between the constructs. It seems there is no way to know if the link works properly (except walking into the amperial construct and see if it works). The line of sight between the two constructs is also mandatory for it to work, despite the fact that there is no more visual clue about it.</div></div><hr />

What really got me away from them is the butt-ugly animation: The running looks just clumsy and - really? - a flip for a 'special-attack'? REALLY? Flip that! If I want to play ridiculous I roll a &lt;insert some class that feels ridiculous but will be offended if call such&gt;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We get 10 for killing the last boss, 10 for completing a dungeon, and 5 for each boss we kill(except the last boss), so it's usually 40 badges per dungeon I think. But yeah, it'll take a lot of time.</div></div><hr />

No drama, honest answers, and a lot of passion in their responses. I know it's beating a dead horse, but it so nice to see devs not saying 'no&quot; or &quot;it will take too long/cost too much&quot; our &quot;we feel/we disagree&quot; about their game. I started playing D3 again, and the current version is what should have shipped. I picked a witch doctor, for the new season, which has never interested me before, and the class is a blast to play - it's a necromancer, but with voodoo. Love it! <br />

<br />
Most games aren't MMOs. And all the MMOs I've played (LotRO, EverQuest, WoW, SWTOR) have downtime to apply patches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What really got me away from them is the butt-ugly animation: The running looks just clumsy and - really? - a flip for a 'special-attack'? REALLY? Flip that! If I want to play ridiculous I roll a &lt;insert some class that feels ridiculous but will be offended if call such&gt;.<br />
<br />
I actually made a Worgen warrior when Cata launched specifically because of the flip animation. I thought it was awesome. Kept that warrior as Arms the whole time. But I eventually race changed it (much later) because once I got that character into my guild's alt raids and was raiding consistently on it, the flip became annoying. The second reason was because when transmog finally came out, I was annoyed by how bad gear looks on the Worgen model. All the gear I spent time farming to make cool-looking sets felt wasted because of how their model looks.</div></div><hr />

Also, thank God flying is back. The game wasn't nearly as enjoyable for me without it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- 5 badges / boss -&gt; 20B/dungeon 15-20mins + 10-15mins waiting time<br />
- 9250 badges needed for non-gear items -&gt; 463 dungeons minus the bonuses ~ 425<br />
<br />
425 * 30 mins -&gt; 213 hours -&gt; 18 days if you play at least 12hrs / day<br />
<br />
You need at least one year to get those if you have a life.<br />
<br />
When people cannot buy even one item / month they just give up farm this crap, trust me.<br />
<br />
It would be impossible for me to care less about these mounts. There was a time, many moons ago, that mounts were more of a status symbol. Now that we are multiple expansions into the game, with the plethora of buyable, cash store and achievement mounts, are people really still feeling like mounts are that big a deal?</div></div><hr />

It's a video game, not a job champ. Learn to get fulfillment for working in your actual job and come home and relax and do something fun that also isn't another job. You'll be happier and make less shitposts on internet forums.</div></div><hr />

Please change your sites name to something proper, it has NOTHING to do with MMO's at all anymore, except WoW and the rest of the shitty blizzard games. Geez.</div></div><hr />

I'd say they should keep the name, and whiny little sods can go to other websites for news about other games than what MMO-C covers. Yeah, that'd be enough. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
