Ladies and gentlemen of the Horde and Alliance, it’s time to synchronize your wardrobes and prepare to do battle. The Trial of Style has arrived and it’s time to put your transmogrification skills to the test.<br />
<br />
You’re Invited!<br />
<br />
When: August 17–21<br />
Where: Queue for the 5-player scenario at your friendly neighborhood Transmog NPC<br />
What: Contestants will have two minutes to create transmog sets from within their collection, based on themes in the scenario. Two players at a time will be pulled up on stage to strike a pose and show off their creation— leaving the remaining three to vote on who of the two has managed to capture the theme best.<br />
<br />
No peeking! It comes as no shock that you'll be properly smocked before the competition begins.<br />
<br />
Strike a pose and shake your little tush...on the catwalk. When the glitter settles, you'll earn your just rewards.<br />
<br />
Once the glitter settles and the rounds of voting have completed First Place (http://www.wowdb.com/items/147573-trial-of-style-reward-first-place), Second Place (http://www.wowdb.com/items/147574-trial-of-style-reward-second-place), and Third Place (http://www.wowdb.com/items/147575-trial-of-style-reward-third-place) winners will be awarded. Don’t worry, even if you don’t win, there’s always the Trial of Style Consolation Prize (http://www.wowdb.com/items/147576-trial-of-style-consolation-prize). These prizes contain Trial of Style Tokens (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1379-trial-of-style-token) which can be redeemed for special transmog gear in Dalaran.<br />
<br />
Fashion conscious citizens of Azeroth can also take advantage of Transmogrification and Barbershop services for free during the Trial of Style. Even if you don’t participate, you can adjust your hairstyle and transmog for no gold cost while the event is active.<br />
<br />

<br />
Where did you get that from? They state that more info on the next patch will be on the reveal stage, which means the reveal is about the next patch. Why would they even bring up a patch, during an expansion reveal?</div></div><hr />

Blizzcon timing has nothing to do with whether or not they announce it. They announced Legion at Gamescom 2015, three months before Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
If they don't announce it, it's because they're not ready to announce it.</div></div><hr />

Also players have horrible tastes. 30 mins ago I was in a trial and a gnome made it in the top three. Luckily no pandas yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing is gonna happen with SC/D3/HS/Overwatch.<br />
<br />
SC recently had the HD remaster, other than that the franchise is as good as dead.<br />
D3 franchise recently had necromancer, so nothing new coming from that.<br />
HS franchise recently had an expansion, the next one won't be announced until Blizzcon.<br />
Overwatch franchise is getting a new map soon, doubt they'll need an hour for it @GC.<br />
<br />
It's pretty much going to be WoW, it could be an expansion, or it could be some hyping for Sargeras/Titans/Argus for the new raid, and reveal a cinematic surrounding that, but the way it's worded, and it being on the exact time slot as Legion announcement, I'm going with an expansion reveal.<br />
<br />
Releasing the date of 7.3 isn't really a reveal, we all know it's dropping before the end of the month (raid not included).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrajin</div><div class="date">2017-08-18, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well considering we know this:<br />
<br />
There's an overwatch cinematic reveal + new map reveal - that alone is about 5 minutes for the cinematic, 10 minute intro, 10 minute map intro and additionally some extra info leading to about 20-25 minutes on that.<br />
<br />
Wow 7.3. - A talk on the patch 15-20 minutes + the 7.3 trailer 2-3 minutes + anything potentially about 7.3.5 and if there's anything on that, another 10-15 minutes<br />
<br />
It's really not hard to fill up an hour for a reveal. Plus SC, HS and D3 will get some screentime on the main stage most likely. <br />
<br />
There won't be a wow expansion talk until Blizzcon at Blizzards showcase convention<br />
<br />
The only reason they announced it in 2015 was because the 18 month wod fest with no reveal would have left the game with no players due to the rate they were declining. If you're lucky we may get a 7.4 mention IF there is going to be one.</div></div><hr />

Of all the non-issues people complain about, this is the most non-issuey.</div></div><hr />

Junkrat/Roadhog seems most likely? Maybe a followup on the Sombra/Zarya stuff? Something different entirely?<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be the new Widowmaker map?</div></div><hr />

Also players have horrible tastes. 30 mins ago I was in a trial and a gnome made it in the top three. Luckily no pandas yet.<br />
<br />
I have seen a male pandaren win the 1st prize on a trial, but it was very fitting - representing a farmer in the everyday heroes theme.</div></div><hr />

It is an issue since that account is the only way I can do this event since my primary one is full.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I won a &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; dressed like a mountaineer. Sometimes creativity is appreciated more than sticking to the actual theme it seems.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moonstream</div><div class="date">2017-08-18, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did this a few times last night, until I finally got first after getting 2nd and 3rd like 4 times in a row. Is a lot of fun but I wish there would be more prize options, the ones they have are pretty lackluster. Or if the bag would drop some fun temporary cosmetic buff or something. Or even a toy? Idk, just something more than <br />
<br />
The tabard one really through the group for a loop, only one of us had one lol.</div></div><hr />

You think people aren't leaving now? Lol.</div></div><hr />

I dressed my warlock up in literal Fire &amp; Ice gear, with matching blue and orange shoulders to boot. A rogue in an all-black set won. I didn't even place. I mean, I won first eventually, but I won't touch it now. Too many drooling mongs.</div></div><hr />

Not as many as back then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apparently, that's it. There should be a low-hanging fruit set like they have now, and then rare single pieces that one can acquire. Perhaps universal gear like hats from the vendor. Or a changing assortment of gear sold in all those existing class gear shops in Dalaran. As it is now, they're basically rarely visited background.<br />
<br />
The RP server folk must be also concerned (in an mode befitting their particular character) since they're particularly interested in dress-up.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Konteil</div><div class="date">2017-08-18, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">might play with the trial of style later. i think i have some decent mogs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lord Pebbleton</div><div class="date">2017-08-18, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh that could be possible. But I think Widow has had her fair share of cinematics, as good as it would be. There are still a large amount of characters we haven't seen in these shorts. I was hoping we'd see one with Doomfist and the &quot;Team Talon trio&quot; But I think it's a little late now<br />
<br />
To be fair, I appreciate style more than I appreciate sticking to the theme. This morning the theme was black and deadly, and a not-so-black rogue won. In the meantime there were people dressed as literal clowns, with black stuff on them caught in the forgotten depths of the transmo tab. No matches, different palettes of black, just horrible. The rogue on the other hand had nothing to do with the theme but he was really well put together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My first time in it was the &quot;Tabard Time&quot; theme, and the person who won was just some paladin in his raid gear. Wasn't even wearing a tabard. Yay this event.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apparently a lot of people don't collect tabards. I sported a rare tabard with matching xmog and came in 3rd. The winner had no tabard at all. <br />
<br />
Similarly, I saw a beautifully outfitted Panda man in shimmering white cloth lose &quot;By the Light&quot; to people who were mostly out of theme even though he received all my votes.</div></div><hr />
