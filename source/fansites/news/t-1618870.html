Patch 6.0.3 Notes<br />
Patch 6.0.3 goes live tomorrow to fix things that cannot be hotfixed.<br />
Weâ€™re planning to release a patch tomorrow that will bring the live game up-to-date with the version currently being tested on the beta realms. This includes a number of fixes and changes to address issues we've identified since the release of 6.0.2, as well as remaining assets and content to prepare for the launch of Warlords of Draenor. As we've done in prior expansions, our plan is to not require a launch-day patch, and have a smooth transition to the new expansion in North America at midnight Pacific on November 13.<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons: Trading Post Guide Updated<br />
Our Trading Post guide has been updated to reflect changes since the original post.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/tradingPostBanner.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/893-Warlords-of-Draenor-Garrisons-Trading-Post) <br />
<br />
<br />
Normal Highmaul Open for Testing<br />
The full Highmaul raid is now open on all beta realms, and will remain so for at least a couple of days. Please use this thread to provide feedback or otherwise discuss the raid content. At this stage, the most helpful type of feedback will be (of course) bug reports and tuning issues. In terms of tuning targets, there should be a steady increase in difficulty as you go from Kargath, to Twin Ogron, to Ko'ragh, and finally to Imperator Mar'gok. The other three optional bosses should be scattered in the middle of that difficulty spectrum. And, of course, this is Normal mode so the target audience is friends-and-family raiding groups, with pickup groups having increasing success as gear and knowledge of the fights spreads through the community.<br />

Candy Buckets in Old Blasted Lands<br />
Tagging this with blue for anyone asking how to get the candy buckets in Blasted Lands now.<br />
<br />

<br />
On the border of Blasted Lands and Swamp of Sorrows, there's an NPC named Zidormi who will phase Blasted Lands to the old one if you need it. She can also phase it back to the current version when you're ready.

Arthas Costume Price<br />
180+60+256+10 = 506.<br />
<br />
Even if you get the absolute minimum possible, you still have enough for the costume. Assuming it's a simple coinflip for the Handful of Treats determination (50% chance of getting 2, 50% chance of getting 3), the odds of you getting the absolute minimum is <br />
<br />
1 out of 11,150,372,599,265,311,570,767,859,136,324,180,752,990,208.<br />
<br />
This isn't even counting the odds of you getting the absolute minimum from the Horseman too!<br />
This is accurate (well I don't know if those odds are accurate or not, but the drops are). Even with the worst possible drops every single day you would end with 506.

Why is poisoned arrow scaling with AP while Incendiary/Frozen arrows scale with weapon damage ?<br />
Fits the effect. Using weapon damage when the weapon isn't hitting is quite weird. Bleeds, Poisons, etc, are always AP-based. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/525218878578638850))<br />

<br />
Nah, folks mostly slaughter the Frogs en masse because they want Lesser Charms for upgrades, and they have an incredibly short respawn timer. They only drop ~1 charm a piece, but when you can kill a few thousand an hour, it adds up. <br />
<br />
Granted, in 2 weeks those charms will be useless, but hey we need to fill time some how.</div></div><hr />

Horde get a new, unique pet while Alliance just get a new way to get the preexisting Nether Ray Fry? It also looks like Alliance classes who don't wear plate miss out on the majority of the gear. Just a set of gloves which are nowhere near as interesting for transmog as a helm.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thorvath</div><div class="date">2014-10-28, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is that Trading Post guide accurate?

<br />
The Nether Ray Fry is likely a place holder, though it's probably still going to be a copy/paste of that pet similar to how the two new Hallow's End pets are both basically the same ghost kitty. The Horde wasp is a new Draenor pet but it's a copy/paste of the new Draenor wasps which can be found out in the world. And ofc they are BoA so you'll be able to get both anyway. <br />
<br />
As to the armor, well the city guard armor from the Armory was tagged as cosmetic to be used by all classes despite clearly appearing to be plate, so the Shatari armor might end up that way too. The fact that the gloves were tagged cosmetic already is either evidence to that effect or an oversight.</div></div><hr />

Usually it is a bit hit/miss to solo but the warchief was down in a dozen or so moves. I suspect either their health has been reduced to speed the encounter, or the players faction increased to zerg the encounter. It no longer takes as long to do as the rest of the encounter.<br />

Literally just done it myself and the King died to 1 fireball from Warlock, so guess they made the chess pieces scale with item level now, great :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a difference between recycling and lore bending. Time travel has always been present in WoW, for as long as the Bronze Dragonfligtht have been in the game its been there, going back to Draenor before it was blown up and ultimately became Outland isn't recycling.<br />
<br />
Learn the difference, don't be an uneducated imbecile.</div></div><hr />

While WoD is somewhat underwhelming to me Draenor is far from recycled. Running around on beta it becomes obvious quickly that the only thing resembling Outland is the names of things. It's a nicely done new continent and far from a rehash. I still think I will enjoy it more than MoP if nothing more than they're spreading the raids out more. Less content drought is what we need.</div></div><hr />

Spine has been soloable for some time. All you need to do is move back and forth on the spine and it's done in about 5 min.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is how I've always thought everything should work. After getting the quest achievement for a zone, just have a vendor appear that sells non-disenchantable versions of all the gear. Having transmog skins be suddenly unobtainable because you already quested through a zone is the worst.</div></div><hr />

Thats great to see but what about all the other glaring issues people have pointed out with clipping like heads poking through helmets and the myriad of other reasonable requests for things to be fixed? My female humans right eyebrow is stuck in the ORLY look.</div></div><hr />

It's soloable providing you have sufficient self healing and run from left to right constantly to prevent Deathwing from rolling. That said, they could make it easier I guess as casuals will still have trouble doing it, not quite sure how much easier they could make it really though beyond allowing you to skip it completely if you have done it before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same here, what they need to remove to make it soloable (no matter the difficulty) is the damn Blood Queen 2, 3, 4 man (depending on class) required to do the Shadowmourne quest, I'm having a friend come back to the game on the 7 day promotion just for that.</div></div><hr />
