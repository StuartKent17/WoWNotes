Cataclysm Currency Changes Formula<br />
Expect an interesting update in a few minutes.<br />
Here's some information on how each of the currencies will be converted in the next content patch. Keep in mind these values may change, and they can get a bit math heavy. Just know that our intent is to appropriately value each mark and provide a conversion we feel is fair.<br />
<br />
The following items are immediately converted to gold:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Emblem of Heroism = 5.5 gold each<br />
Emblem of Valor = 5.5 gold each<br />
Emblem of Conquest = 5.5 gold each<br />
Badge of Justice = 1.833 gold each<br />
<br />
<br />
Your New Honor Points total will be the sum of the following amounts:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Old Honor * 0.024<br />
Old Arena Points * 0.85<br />
Battleground Mark of Honor * 2.976<br />
Wintergrasp Mark of Honor * 19.08<br />
Stone Keeper Shard * 1.6<br />
Venture Coin * 3<br />
Spirit Shard * 1<br />
<br />
<br />
Your Justice Points total will be equal to (Emblems of Triumph + Emblems of Frost ) * 2.75<br />
<br />
Again, the softcap for both Honor and Justice conversions is 4000 points. This means that if a character converts to above 4,000 points, it will not be possible for them to earn more until they fall below the 4,000 cap.<br />
<br />
A hardcap will be implemented in a following patch before Cataclysm's release. At that time, any excess points above 4,000 will be converted as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Honor points above 4,000 are converted to gold at a rate of 35 silver per point of Honor.<br />
Justice points above 4,000 are converted to gold at a rate of 2 gold per point of Justice.</div></div><hr />

- be able to by heroic dungeon equivalent gear<br />
- might be able to buy 1 or 2 pieces of T11, but not the whole set</div></div><hr />

<br />
You won't be able to buy anything at 85 with your current type of points since that would require the other tier points (heroism points I think).<br />
They didn't say anything of the sort.<br />
<br />
Current tier gear will be the high end points (not justice).<br />
<br />
Previous tier will be justice points.<br />
<br />
They haven't explicitly said but it stands to reason that there will be non-tier level 85 gear to purchase with justice points immediately upon the release of cataclysm. Otherwise the points are absolutely, positively, useless.<br />
<br />
T10 will get replaced with quest gear in a level or two (Plus its cheaper by far to buy with badges than with points).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Has anyone actually noticed that the honor cap is effectively more than doubled now? 75000 old honor * .024 conversion rate = 1800 new honor. Since we can cap at 4000 now, that's a lot more effective honor we can store up.</div></div><hr />

Fast forward to level 85.<br />
<br />
Why on earth would you run level 85 heroics if all they give you is the gear they drop (which you'll cease to find useful rather quickly), and justice points that can buy nothing useful?<br />

Clearly, justice badges are going to be able to buy something useful for a level 85 who's able to run heroics (beyond BoA gear). Unless you think the design goal is so people can accumulate enough points such that when the next tier comes out, they can immediately buy a full set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They wont be useless - you will still be able to buy anything you can buy today with them. But don't expect Justice points to buy you anything good in Cataclysm. You will have to earn new (better) points for that. Otherwise, we could just /farm now and collect later, which would not make any sense.</div></div><hr />

You wont get Justice points for running 85 Heroics - you will get Valor (or whatever they called them) Justice Points are only what we get for eliminating/converting out all our current badges to the new point system.</div></div><hr />

The favorable conversion rates suggests that Blizz wants to popularize Venture Co. and Wintergrasp as training for Tol Barad. I almost bought Marks of Honor last week. I'm glad I held off, but it'll be a moot point if there isn't anything new to buy with Honor points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is direct from bliz<br />
<br />
Here's the breakdown: <br />
<br />
PvE <br />
Hero Points -- Low-tier, easier-to-get PVE points. Maximum cap to how many you can own, but no cap to how quickly you can earn them. Earned from most dungeons. (most like the current Emblem of Triumph) <br />
Valor Points -- High-tier, harder-to-get PvE points. Maximum cap to how many you can own, as well as a cap to how many you can earn per week. Earned from Dungeon Finder daily Heroic and from raids. (most like the current Emblem of Frost) <br />
<br />
Since then they re-named Hero points to Justice points but the point is still the same. It's clear that Justice points are the new Triumph emblems and Valor points are the new Frost emblems.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt they'll increase the cap once cata hits and have the cata gear priced higher (so you don't cap out at 80 and then have a full set as soon as you ding 85), but you'll certainly be able to use the same currency to buy level 85 gear.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but at the same time you get 5 times LESS other loot. Even if you manage to do 5 heroics per hour (which is entered instace cap per hour outside dungeon tool!), it is a laughable 40 gold.<br />

I'm going to be a bit blunt here, but you guys don't seem terribly good with math.<br />
<br />
The T10 helm (iLvL 251) costs 1100 justice points.<br />
<br />
A triumph badge converts into ~3 justice points. You need about 350-400 triumph badges to buy one piece of T10 gear. <br />
<br />
That's (about) 80 random heroics. For one piece of gear. About 250-300 full random heroic runs for 4pc10. <br />
<br />
At 15mins a piece, that's 70-80 hours of running random heroics.<br />
<br />
All for gear that's going to be replaced with your first quest rewards and/or green drops.<br />
<br />
Clearly, not a winning strategy.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. They can just increase the cap to lets say 25k and make cheapest Cata epic cost 10k. So if you cap now till 4k, then some insane GZ on getting 40% of a single epic 'faster' :)</div></div><hr />

Did you honestly expect anything else from Blizzard? If you did you are either new to the game or have not been paying attention. Every time blizzard has converted something they have turned it into more of a grind. <br />
Even if it is individually only a couple of minutes more you have to think like an accountant and times it by the total amount of subs. Nothing is done in this game anymore without the underlying thought being on how to increase subscription time even if it reduces the &quot;fun&quot; factor. Blizzard has been Koticked anyone who thinks otherwise is naive and doesn't understand corporate culture.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what the Justice prices are going to be. My point was that stockpiling badges now wont allow you to buy anything good in Cata. If the price you quoted stands, then you are correct - it isn't worth it. It is better to buy the upgrades now.<br />
<br />
However - for people who have a lot of Triumph badges, but dont have access to Frost badges, this is an opportunity for them to buy some Frost gear for leveling.</div></div><hr />

Since we can cap at 4000 now, that's a lot more effective honor we can store up.<br />
<br />
We do not know if this is really true. Currently, a wrathful 264 ring for example costs 52200 HK - so the cap is about 1.44 rings of honor.<br />
<br />
If the ring costs 3500 Honor Points then the cap is 1.14 rings and the honor cap has effectively been reduced. <br />
If the ring costs 2000 Honor Points then the cap is 2.00 rings and the honor cap has effectively been increased. <br />
<br />
What this means is that all the people who converted their old AB/AV/WG marks on day 1 made a mistake. using HK, you can start with at most 1800 HP; adding in marks, SK, etc can get you to 4000 HP</div></div><hr />

The price of uncut gems on many servers is already in ~50-70g range. 80-120g, if you have JC.<br />
Thus 55g per 10 emblems without any messing with AH (hello there, heavy undercutting and high gem listing fee!) is a very nice bet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A triumph badge converts into ~3 justice points. You need about 350-400 triumph badges to buy one piece of T10 gear. <br />
.<br />
<br />
If this is true, this is absolute crap (for those of us trying to pick up some frost gear, yes i know it will be replaced quickly, but still...) If Frost = Triumph, then we are getting screwed BIG TIME on the conversion. If frost were worth more than triumph i might be ok with this conversion. But as it stands, the tier 10 gear is getting ~4 times MORE EXPENSIVE. Really? What genius at blizzard thought this would be funny?<br />
<br />
Tier 10 helm goes from 95 frost to 400 frost with this patch??? Regardless if triumph is easy to farm, frost just got devalued in a serious manner.<br />
<br />
This is a big step backwards, every tier made the previous tier more accessible. So i am left scratching my head why this obsolete tier is becoming so much more expensive? Shouldn't it stay the same or get cheaper if anything?</div></div><hr />

Bosses (both raid and heroic) after the patch will give Justice points, we don't know how many that will be but I would wager that it's a lot more than the equivalent in frost/triumphs.<br />
<br />
So we're getting our badges wiped, they're giving to us with one hand (triumph) and taking away with another (frost) knowing that we will still be able to farm heroics for T10 items easily after the patch.</div></div><hr />

Hero points will most likely come from heroics and give the equivilent of ilvl 200 gear in Wrath. You might get a few valor points for doing the daily random or something but but justice points are gonna be far from useless. With the current conversion you would need 1454.54 frost/triumph to reach the cap. It is not something that every random is going to have. Even if the 4000 justice points lets us get one piece of loot it would only be equivilent with the best item available from a heroic dungeon.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, not really feasible :P Let's say there's two months until the change goes live, that's around 61 days.<br />
<br />
39,045/61 = 640 emblems needed to attain every day.<br />

<br />
Sadly, our timescale only permits 24 hours a day. You need to hope that release is at least around 81 days away, then, and only then if you farmed 24/7, with zero time delay between heroics with every single one giving 5 emblems, until that date, you'd hit gold cap.<br />

This is the big question, in my view. I have about 300 of these (600k of current honor), and even without converting those, other honor and 'actual' marks, etc, will put me to about 12k of the new honor as it stands, so I'm waiting to see if I should be converting excess to sell as gems or hold off, and whether the BOA marks will hold any retaining value post-patch.</div></div><hr />

I think it's closer to 6 average emblems per random (if you don't skip bosses). Plus you get ~13g for completing a random (no choice not to get this reward). That sums up to approx 8 emblems worth of gold per run, if you don't loot anything. We are still at ~51 days of nostop heroic spam as a tank.<br />
<br />
But yeah, this indeed is not the best path to gold cap :) <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I wonder, if the mail would bug up, if they'd have to send a gold value over gold cap. That is, unless they increase gold cap value till 2^63 copper already when next patch hits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been dumping my Frosts on my main into Primordial Saronites for a while now and selling when the market was good. I converted all of my triumphs a while back to hero badges for epic gem buying as I needed and sometimes to dump uncut (and cut) gems onto the AH for profit depending on which was in demand and best prices per badges (sometimes selling two orange gems [20 badges] was worth more than selling one red gem [20 badges])...<br />
<br />
Based on the current conversation, they say 10 heroism badges are worth 55g, yet I know I can get 85-100g on AH for certain gems.<br />
<br />
So at this point I'm probably going to convert my triumphs to heroism, buy out gems and start selling them in small groups so as not to flood the market, all my frost badges will go towards primordial saronites and when it comes time for actually worrying about JP I'll get it naturally doing raids and random daily *shrugs*</div></div><hr />

Yes, it can be a gold sink of a single person on a server, where really there is enough demand for ~100g worth cut gems till the patch.<br />

<br />
This is a big step backwards, every tier made the previous tier more accessible. So i am left scratching my head why this obsolete tier is becoming so much more expensive? Shouldn't it stay the same or get cheaper if anything?<br />
<br />
Because when this patch hits, there will only be a few weeks left before Cata is released, and frost gear is 100% worthless from that date. Many seem to miss this. I see people write stuff like &quot;levelling in frost&quot;, and that is something that you won't do. Previous expansions the top raid gear has been very usable, to the point that Naxx could be defeated in Sunwell gear. This will NOT happen in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
So, this is a good point in time to do this. You get SOMETHING for your old useless emblems, but it wont buy you much in Cata. Blizzard could just as well reset all your badges.<br />
<br />
And, everything points to justice dropping from heroics (and old tier raids) in Cata and valor dropping from current tier raids. However, I'm not so sure you will be able to buy epics at 85 with justice from day 1. More likely, you will get top ilvl blues, and perhaps one or two epics. I think a lot of you equate triumph with gear good enough to faceroll heroics and some raids with, and assume justice will be similar. It wont be, not initially.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glub</div><div class="date">2010-09-15, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You wont get Justice points for running 85 Heroics - you will get Valor (or whatever they called them) Justice Points are only what we get for eliminating/converting out all our current badges to the new point system.<br />
<br />
This is far from true. Read the original blue post again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Justice points are equivalent to the current Emblems of Triumph. <br />
Valor points are equivalent to the current Emblems of Frost.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When you run dungeons, old raids and 85 Heroics, bosses will give you Justice points (I guess that an amount proportional to the boss level and player level). <br />
When you run 85 raids, bosses will give you Valor points.<br />
When you run your first 85 heroic of the day using the Dungeon Finder system, you will get a small amount of Valor points.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe the confusion exists because your current Emblems of Frost are being converted to Justice points. Well, get used to it, because this is what will happen every time new content (and tier) is introduced: they will convert all your Valor points to Justice points, so every new content you start with nada, just Justice points.<br />
<br />
Now, what can justice points buy you? All the epics from the second best tier downwards. That means that when the new patch arrives, tier 10 will be available for Justice points. When Cata arrives, the next tier (supposedly tier 11) will become available, but only fot Valor points, which no one will have, and only for level 85, which no one will be yet.<br />
<br />
When you hit 85, there will *probably* be blues appropriate for that level that you will be able to buy for Justice points (at least I hope so).</div></div><hr />

Ofcourse you can buy SOMETHING at level 85. However, initially it will be blues and perhaps epics for a few slots. Justice WILL drop from heroics in cata, and of course you will be able to buy something for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well if the cost was the same, you'd have people farming triumphs right now to get that gear easily. They just don't want farming Triumphs now to be an easy way to obtain that gear. If you are close to getting a piece of Frost gear you probably have the time to go grab the piece you want now before the conversion happens. <br />
<br />
I haven't tested it on the PTR but I'm guessing the amount of Justice Points you get per boss in a raid/heroic is going to be much higher in 4.0 than the emblems you get now. So once the patch goes live you can probably earn that gear in roughly the same time that you can now. They'll probably have ICC award a lot more points than you will out of a heroic to compensate.</div></div><hr />

Current gold cap is based on the maximum value of a signed &quot;int&quot; variable on a 32 bit system. If they change the variable to a &quot;long int&quot; it will increase the gold cap by an order of magnitude. You'll never get it. It'll go from roughly 2,140,000,000 copper (214,000 gold and change) to roughly 9,220,000,000,000,000,000 copper (922,000,000,000 gold).

Continental Europeans use commas to indicate a decimal point, and periods to separate every third number digit of a long number. So if something cost three thousand Euros and twenty three cents in, say, Germany the price tag would say 3.000,23 It's a bit confusing when you first land in Europe, but you get used to it quickly. Similarly, they find our system a bit confusing sometimes if they haven't seen it before.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pbean</div><div class="date">2010-09-15, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to make gold with your Emblems of Triumph, rather than Justice Points, please note the following.<br />
<br />
For 20 Emblems of Heroism you can buy a one-coloured epic gem, for 10 Emblems of Heroism you can buy a two-coloured gem.<br />
<br />
Let's say a Scarlet Ruby or Majestic Zircon goes for about 100g on your server, it would value each emblem as 5g (100/20 = 5).<br />
<br />
On my server, the two-coloured gems are about 60-80g. That would value about 6-8g per gem.<br />
<br />
The &quot;value&quot; of each gem upon conversion is 5.5g, which is in between.<br />
<br />
So basically if on your server two-coloured gems go for more than 55g on the AH, buy them and sell them now. For one-coloured gems, they'd have to be 110g or more. Factor in the auction house cut (5%) and you'd have to auction them for 57g89s48c and 115g78s95c respectively.<br />
<br />
And better do it fast, because with this information public, and Cataclysm coming soon, prices may drop significantly.<br />
<br />
EDIT<br />
Oh lord, I posted this before I read all the comments, but WOW, are some of you guys retarded, or what?<br />
<br />
Why are you so surprised that Frost and Triumph convert into the same thing at the same rate? Come Cataclysm &quot;Frost&quot; will be the lower tier. Currently, Heroism, Valor and Conquest are the lower tiers, and to buy 1 Conquest you need 1 Triumph, for 1 Valor you need 1 Conquest, etc. Even for 1 Triumph you need 1 Frost. With the release of Cataclysm, Emblems of Frost will be no worth more than Emblems of Triumph, because all gear will be old and bad. So it makes sense.<br />
<br />
And what about buying all this Emblem of Frost gear before Cataclysm comes out? Your Emblem of Frost gear will be replaced with level 83 green quest gear. That's right! If you're going to buy more items with your Emblems of Frost right now for non-aesthetic reasons and not for progression, you're just wasting money. Buy Primordial Saronites to sell them to those fools who still want to craft items, or stockpile them so you'll have some Justice Points when Cataclysm comes.<br />
<br />
Then those people who say Justice Points are only there for the transition to Cataclysm? Ha-ha! Surely, you jest? 300 Emblems for a Tier 10 helm? It's harder to believe that they punched in random numbers there. Also, this post right here (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=24401796793) states very clearly, that there indeed will be two tiers of points. Now Hero points were just renamed to Justice points.<br />
<br />
And finally, no, you won't be able to buy omg uber epics at level 85 with your current stockpiling. You would need 1455 Emblems of Frost and/or Triumph to reach the cap. Furthermore a reasonable amount of 300 emblems (I have about 650 on my character) gives 825 JP, which isn't that much. With a cap of 4000, it stands to reason you'd need about 2000 points for 1 item (so you could stockpile enough for 2 items). So 825 &quot;helps you&quot; but won't &quot;get you an item&quot;. And even if it does, it probably will be just 1 &quot;lower tier&quot; item. Furthermore, think about these 2 things:<br />
<br />
- At level 80 you could buy a crafted item level 200 shield. Also there was an item level 200 shield available from Emblems of Heroism. So you were able to buy &quot;an epic&quot; right at level 80 too!<br />
- You can queue for random dungeons from level 70-80 and get 2 Emblems of Triumph for finishing it. With the cheapest item being 25 Emblems (not even counting the 19 emblem Conquest items), it'd take you 12 days to get an item level 245 epic, right when you ding 80!<br />
- I won't even mention the current item level 264 epics which you can buy right now upon getting to 80.<br />
<br />
So all in all, why the hell are you not thinking about this clearly?<br />
<br />
Then again, in the end we're all just assuming and guessing. We'll have to see and keep an eye on future announcements.</div></div><hr />

We all know Blizzard got tired of getting told the game is too easy and that they're giving away free epics to every scrub, and purples are supposed to be epic again as we'll likely spend a lot more time in blues before getting greater gear, but let's hope this isn't a complete 180-degree turn because there are no words to describe the cataclysmic tear fest that's going to happen (not to mention the unwanted comeback of elistist &quot;I'm better than you because my gear is purple&quot; crap).<br />

An epic now costs anywhere between 25 and 95 emblems, let's take a high number, 50, as average. I would reckon (but this is just a guess), that 1500-2000 points would give 1 piece of epic gear at 85. 2000/50 = 40 points per boss kill would be reasonable. I expect about 25-50 points per boss kill (perhaps 25 for &quot;normal&quot; bosses and 50 points for the last boss, in heroics, or 25 per boss and just 25 extra for finishing it, etc).<br />
<br />
But who knows, maybe they plan on mobs giving points too (say 1 point per mob, with 100 mobs per dungeon, i.e. 100 extra points per dungeon).<br />
<br />
I am fairly sure that the rate of earning points will be really close to the current rate of earning Emblems (as an Emblem/Points per boss rate, not and Emblem/Points per hour rate, because content will be harder at the start of course).</div></div><hr />

One of the nice things with this new system is that there's a possibility to award extra points for harder bosses, make the system more fine-grained than the current one emblem per boss if they so desire. Those numbers can also be adjusted when new heroics are released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes you will be able to buy the lowest level of &quot;emblem gear&quot;, just like you could buy lowest level PvP gear when WotLK dropped with honor points you saved up in TBC if you were honor capped when LK shipped.<br />
<br />
However (again - just like with honor gear when WotLK dropped), the new gear will be much more expensive, meaning your precious Frost emblems WILL translate to helping you buy gear in Cata, but will not be sufficient for very much. This was the case as well when the new WotLK PvP gear was way more expensive (while using the same points system as before) than anything you had been able to buy back in TBC.<br />
<br />
For example, let's say you have 1000 Justice Points when Cata is about to ship. This might allow you to buy some Icecrown gear (264). Or you can save your Justice Points for when you hit 85. But the new &quot;heroics&quot; gear in Cata is going to cost say 2000 each, so your precious savings from Frost/Triumph badges will have lost much of it's value.<br />
<br />
Heroics in Cata are going to drop more than the current 1 emblem per boss. My guess is that bosses in heroics are going to drop 5 Justice Points each. My reason for making this guess is that they chose to let Triumph/Frost badges convert at a rate of 2.75. When a new expansion hits, all values tend to be roughly doubled - the amount of gold, the cost of honor gear, the stats on your items and so on. Everything gets doubled, pretty much. Tbhis is obviously speculation on my behalf (that heroics bosses will drop 5 Justice Points each).<br />
<br />
Also, just like when WotLK shipped, there will be Valor Points which gives you the finest raid gear and which you cannot get from doing heroics. In WotLK these dropped from 25-man raids. In Cata, becuase they are equalizing 10-man and 25-man raiding, Valor Points will drop from both 10-mans and 25-mans.<br />
<br />
To sum up:<br />
<br />
This will happen when Cata ships:<br />
<br />
Justice Points can buy you your first epics in Cata.<br />
You can save up Justice Points (JP) from Wrath of The Lich King, but the conversion rate is kind of bad and thus your measly WotLK JPs will not suffice for much.<br />
You will get Justice Points from running heroics in Cata. This will be a much more powerful way to get those points.<br />
<br />
Valor points buys you the really hawt gear in Cata.<br />
Raid bosses (10-man and 25-man) will drop Valor Points.<br />
You will get a few Valor Points from doing the daily Random Heroic, just like you get a few Frost badges today.<br />
<br />
Then, after patch 4.1 when a new raid tier is released, all your then Valor Points will be converted into Justice Points and you will sit on a lot of Justice Points, and zero Valor Points. That conversion will then happen over and over when a new raid tier (or expansion) hits. No justice points 8or emblems) will ever be deleted, however, due to them inflating the numbers at every expansion, they value will be less and less of points hard earned long ago.<br />
<br />
---------- Post added 2010-09-15 at 10:15 PM ----------<br />
<br />
<br />
Likely that Valor points will drop in both heroics and the first teir of raiding, just like Wotlk with Heroism emblems.<br />
<br />
That comparison is misleading. <br />
<br />
This is how they've stated it will be/was:<br />
<br />
In WotLK:<br />
Heroism emblems drops from heroics and 10-man raids.<br />
Valor emblems drops from 25-man raids.<br />
<br />
In Cata:<br />
Heroism points (later renamed to Justice Points) drops from heroics.<br />
Valor points drop from raids. This will include both 10-man and 25-man.<br />
<br />
The reason they changed the name from Heroism to Justice for the low level points is probably that &quot;heroic&quot; is supposed to mean hard when it comes to raids - something that evolved along the way of WotLK. When WotLK shipped, there wasn't anything such as heroic raids - &quot;heroic&quot; then only meant &quot;heroic 5-mans&quot;, which means it then made sense to have Heroism emblems drop from &quot;Heroics&quot;. Now, they need a more neutral word becuase &quot;heroic&quot; can mean several things. They chose &quot;Justice&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calaba</div><div class="date">2010-09-15, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here's the maths:<br />
1 epic gem = 10000 honor = 240 new honor. <br />
240 honor x 35 silver for the trade-in = 84g. <br />
Conclusion: Going over the honor cap is ok, you won't lose much when they give you the gold. <br />
For arena points, it's a good deal- you're getting 85 new honor points for every 100 arena points, instead of handing them in for 2000 old honor, or 48 honor points. That's double what you'll get if you trade them in now. <br />
Stonekeepers shards are converted for wintergrasp commendation amounts, so you don't lose anything there.<br />
And be happy to be getting anything from venture company coins and spirit shards at all:p<br />
<br />
So, if you're going WAY over the honor cap, you're fine there, and need to do nothing at all, just watch the cash roll in. Unless, of course, they reset honor points. In which case, SELL SELL SELL!!! :)<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, if you've got a few emblems of triumph, or emblems of frost kicking around, SELL NOW. The amount you'll get for going over the cap SIMPLY WON'T BE WORTH IT, and the price of saronites and epic gems is going to plummet when these changes go live. Prices are going down, and the gear you can get from them right now will be no better than lvl 80 greens, so cash in soon. Unless, of course, you still need gear from them. It also won't be worth it to grind out 5-mans to hit the cap. You'll be better off AoE grinding regular mobs for gold. (Unless you're going for achievements or something.) The reason? Crafted lvl85 gear, bought off the AH. These new points simply won't get you anything better. <br />
<br />
Of course, this is all based on various assumptions, including server economies, and PTR stuff being subject to change.</div></div><hr />

No, try reading it again.<br />
<br />
Honor is honor. Like, you know, we've had honor points for the last couople of years in the game. You use honor points to buy PvP gear and the current cap of 75k honor is being raised even further.<br />
<br />
The 4k cap is for Justice Points, which is the new PvE currency that is modelled on the old honor points for PvP. it will work similar but it is different. And it is for PvE, not for PvP.</div></div><hr />

No, no, no, no no. He'll get around 3500g with his current stockpile as he goes over the honor cap, which is also 4000. This new cap is equivalent to 166666 &quot;old&quot; honor currently, in other words a little more than double what it is now.</div></div><hr />

For T10 items it just doesn't seem to scan. 400 badges for items that currently cost 95. :/<br />
For Gems it is bad. 80 badges for items that currently cost 20.<br />
And for legacy gear it's 260 badges for weapons that currently cost 65.<br />
I don't know what the T9 conversions are, but I don't imagine they are favorable.<br />
At least the Gold conversion is reasonable. A red gem for 20 badges gets you max 110g cut on my server, so why bother with the AH and just get the gold straight from the source.<br />

I'm taking away from this that I better get my ducks in a row and buy any Legacy gear or cosmetic items I want for my characters before this change over and then convert everything else to lower badges and collect the cash. I have a distinct feeling that both point awards and the point cap will be significantly higher at 85, just like honor caps in 60/70/80 game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 trinket and the Relic slot (for classes that use them) are NOT quest rewards in the first zones of Cata. All other gear that you can buy with emblems WILL be replaced. If you are deciding what to buy now, my advise is to go for a trinket and relic first. They are the only item slot that will make it out of the first zone in cata unless you are in ICC25 gear.<br />
<br />
I'm personally getting them for all my alts and the rest will go towards gems to be sold on the AH.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, it is very unlikely that the devs will allow justice points we can earn now to give us any significant head start in Cata. My reasoning goes like this. The absolute best gear you can get from raiding now will barely last you until 85. Do we really think that anything we can earn from heroics now will be valuable at 85?<br />
<br />
Either they are going to force a cash-out of justice points when cata launches (ie, we get gold, but start with 0JP), or else the price of items that can be bought with JP at 85 will dwarf anything we can possibly earn now.</div></div><hr />

It is in the thread. The short version is: T10 - Trinkets and Belts 694 JP, Cloaks 578, Primordials 266, Pants 1100. T9 - Trinks 435, necks 271, helm 489, hands and shoulders 326, Cardinals and King's Amber etc 217, Dreadstone &amp; Amertine 108. Heirlooms 706-435 JP. <br />

<br />
It says anything over the soft cap for 4000 will be converted into 1 = 35 silver.<br />
<br />
It also says that 1 old honor = .024 new honor. <br />
<br />
By that math 75000 old honor = 1800<br />
<br />
Thus, the new cap will be equivalent to: 4000/.024 = 166666.67 honor (roughly double)<br />

<br />
Now my honor did not convert! It stayed at the same 12524 it was when I went in. And my Wintergrasp commendations still say they award 2000 honor (although upon use nothing happens [ad they are still consumed])<br />

No point bothering with even that on Malfurion. AH prices have hit rock-bottom, with solid gems selling for ~65g and mixed for much lower (~40g). It's a shame, but that's what happened near the end of TBC as well. My plan is to just hoard what I already have since I'll get more gold that way than trying to play the auction house.<br />

Yay cheap gems...which might be useful for leveling JC from 450-475 or so at the beginning of Cata if the prices are 'right' compared to the new 'green' quality gems.<br />
<br />
As with some other &quot;max lvl for current content&quot;-recepies, they don´t give good skillups past 450 (455 if you´re Draenei, not sure if they are<br />
removing that racial), they turn green at 452 and grey at 465.<br />
Then again with the planned change in skilling up, isn´t it something like &quot;orange give a small bucket of skillups, yellow give more than 1, and green give you 1 skillup&quot;?<br />
Might be a sure way to get to 465 fast enough and save some of the new precious minerals a few lvls... might be some handy info on the Cata profession forum! :D</div></div><hr />

Rocketbear, I don't see how hard it is to grasp that hero points doesn't exist anymore. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One change of note since that original announcement is that we've changed the name of the low-tier PvE currency from Hero Points to Justice Points. The original announcement post has been updated to reflect this.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvE <br />
Justice Points -- Low-tier, easier-to-get PVE points. Maximum cap to how many you can own, but no cap to how quickly you can earn them. Earned from most dungeons. (most like the current Emblem of Triumph) <br />
Valor Points -- High-tier, harder-to-get PvE points. Maximum cap to how many you can own, as well as a cap to how many you can earn per week. Earned from Dungeon Finder daily Heroic and from raids. (most like the current Emblem of Frost) <br />
<br />
Justice = Hero<br />
Valor = Valor<br />
<br />
Justice will have non-tier level 85 stuff at the start of Cata. <br />
Valor will have T11 level stuff at the start of Cata.<br />
<br />
Valor is limited per week.<br />
Justice are unlimited per week.<br />
<br />
Once t12 level stuff comes out, t11 moves to Justice and your Valor points are wiped. It's a simple concept.<br />
<br />
It states it in the second post by a blue on the Main page of MMO-Champ. Hero is renamed Justice.<br />

<br />
You can start farming Venture Coins. There is a quest to get the Element 117 thing that gives 2 coins that is infinitely repeatable and you don't have to be flagged. Granted I think only 2 spawn on the ship, maybe 2 more in another place. You can basically run back and forth and one will be up always on the ship if you're doing it alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
End bosses in TBC heroics dropped epics, just like in Wotlk.<br />
<br />
And in the end what does &quot;epic&quot; really mean? It's just a colour, a loot quality indicator. If you work hard you'll still get better gear than everyone else. If you're in full 277 epics, you're still able to say you have a bigger e-peen than someone in 232 gear with some 264 Emblem items. Just like you could show your epic e-peen to blue &quot;lowbies&quot; &quot;back in the day&quot;.<br />
<br />
Though I would love that heroics scaled with gear somehow. Because doing heroics tuned for level 80 blue gear in item level 251 raid gear just bores me (and everyone else) out.</div></div><hr />

But if you haven't turn them in before 4.0 and blizz will automatically change them for you and you will get 2 new honor points. Meaning you get 50% less. But don't buy Honor with wintergrasp marks because then you will also lose, so keep those. On live you can spend 9 wintergrasp marks for 2k hononr = 48. But in 4.0 9 wintergrasp marks will be transfered to 171 new honor points <br />

Live - BGs mark = 180 honor --&gt; 4 new honor points in 4.0<br />
4.0 - BGs mark --&gt; 2 new honor points<br />

<br />
Even if this is so, the cost of saronites on the AH is going DOWN, since you'll be able to buy em from 5-mans, the market will be flooded, and because people are gonna realise they'll be useless in a few weeks. The same will apply to epic gems too. PvP points don't suffer so much - the new cap is 166666 or so in today's money which is easy to reach, and going over the cap will get you a good amount of gold in return. <br />
<br />
The 1400+ triumph/frost badges you'll need to reach the cap aren't as easy to get. It's roughly 200 Wrath 5-man instances, whereas it'll probably only be 20 or so Cata ones, ie, better to just do a few 5-mans while leveling anyway. The rate of return is just lame in comparison to PvP honor points for the time being. It'll be better to have gold for BoE blues/epics, which will be just as good.</div></div><hr />

Why not? You'll be able to buy a (more or less) complete set of BoE blue + some BoE epic gear with the amount of gold you could earn farming trash anyway... being able to buy 1 or 2 items with the new points system is hardly game-breaking... although having said that, it wouldn't surprise me if they decided to reset the points right at the last moment...</div></div><hr />

Also if you do dungeons from 80-85 all those should give you Justice points as well iirc. Justice points are basically going to be for everything that isn't the best. The best will be from Valor points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It'll probably be similar to the costs of pvp gear based on Honor / arena points are right now. Around 1.1k per Helm/Chest/Legs, 900~ for Shoulders/gloves. So if you have 4k which is the max you'll be able to get 3-4. Chest+Legs+Helm+Gloves = 4k if those numbers I pulled out of the air are any where around what they are.</div></div><hr />

Even if you play only in english, when you buy the game in a country with localized version, it'll come flagged as being of that country.

Honor is honor. Like, you know, we've had honor points for the last couople of years in the game. You use honor points to buy PvP gear and the current cap of 75k honor is being raised even further.<br />
<br />
The 4k cap is for Justice Points, which is the new PvE currency that is modelled on the old honor points for PvP. it will work similar but it is different. And it is for PvE, not for PvP.<br />
<br />
Ehh... Did you read a different post than everyone else?<br />
Your New Honor Points total will be the sum of the following amounts:<br />
<br />
* Old Honor * 0.024<br />
* Old Arena Points * 0.85<br />
* Battleground Mark of Honor * 2.976<br />
* Wintergrasp Mark of Honor * 19.08<br />
* Stone Keeper Shard * 1.6<br />
* Venture Coin * 3<br />
* Spirit Shard * 1<br />
....<br />
<br />
Honor points above 4,000 are converted to gold at a rate of 35 silver per point of Honor.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's what the blue post I read said. Which makes your parent post completely correct.<br />
<br />
Edit to add:<br />
<br />
I'd love to go back to the days of TBC where the only epics you had came from raiding or being exhalted with a faction, I loved doing heroics with people in blue gear which took like 2 hours and when you got someone full epic you KNEW they were good and it was rare, now everyone is epic in WOTLK by heroics alone, so hopefully Cata is more like TBC.<br />
And you apparently played a different TBC than I did. I know plenty of people that never set foot in a TBC raid, but went into Wrath with almost full Epics from Heroic instances, Rep, badges, and PvP. PvP was especially popular, since it was relatively easy to get, and TBC PvP gear didn't budget nearly as much for resilience. It was actually decent for PvE.</div></div><hr />

The absolute earliest this will go live is Tuesday (or Wednesday if you're in Europe), let it download while you're sleeping and use your Internet connection for real stuff now (playing, or whatever you normally do). Even next patch day is pretty unlikely, they'll probably release more updates to it before it goes live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming you're using Windows XP SP3,<br />
<br />
Step 1: Go to your WoW directory, delete the background downloader, then use the repair tool to restore it. This will give you an up-to-date version.<br />
Step 2: Download Internet Explorer 8. This seems to be needed to get it to start up.<br />
Step 3: Right-click the background downloader, click properties, and enable Windows 98/ME compatibility. This will stop it from throwing a runtime exception.<br />
Step 4: Restart your machine.<br />
Step 5: Win.</div></div><hr />

Just because the Beta or PTR still has their issues doesn't mean they can't start streaming updates that are good to go.<br />
<br />
And this is assuming you're talking about actual bugs and not game mechanics that bother you, because if it is game mechanics/changes well then get used to it because it is intended.</div></div><hr />

Main issue i've seen from playing the beta is the fact there is no item rewards yet from Hillsbrad, Twilight Highlands and Uldum maybe alot of other places aswell but i didn't look into other zones, something like this can be easily implemented they should almost be done by now and for all you know it could come next time a patch for the beta hits. <br />
<br />
There was alot of quests missing but if i recall blade's edge wasn't properly done when they released the burning crusade and they patched a fix in.<br />
<br />
Long story short once items are put in the GAME CAN ship anytime blizzard wants.<br />

You make things sound more dramatic than they actually are.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laurabelle</div><div class="date">2010-09-16, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">QUESTION:<br />
<br />
Is the calculation going to be per Blizzards post:<br />
<br />
FLOOR ( ( FROST + TRIUMPH ) * 2.75 ) = JP<br />
<br />
<br />
OR, like BOUB's calculator:<br />
<br />
<br />
FLOOR( FROST * 2.75 ) + FLOOR( TRIUMPH * 2.75 ) = JP<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason is because if the fractional portions of both are &gt;= 1 then BOUB's is off by 1 JP.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
<br />
1333 FROST * 2.75 = 3665.75 BOUB's would floor this and show you 3665 POINTS<br />
<br />
466 TRIUMPH * 2.75 = 1281.5 BOUB's would floor this and show you 1281 POINTS<br />
<br />
BOUB's would then show you 4946 POINTS<br />
<br />
<br />
HOWEVER,<br />
<br />
<br />
If you did (1333 + 466) * 2.75 = 4947.25 (Because we are adding together the .75 and .50 that BOUB's floored out)<br />
<br />
Flooring this would give us 4947 POINTS<br />
<br />
<br />
SO, WHICH IS RIGHT?<br />
<br />
<br />
I DO NO WANT TO BE JIPPED OUT OF A JP POINT!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you did not care about JP and only wanted GOLD, wouldn't it be WAY smarter a move to downgrade all your TRIUMPH down to HEROISM, because you'd get 5.5g gold a piece for those rather than 4g a piece after the second round (for excess of 4K JP) (sell primordials with all frost while you can).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I DO NO WANT TO BE JIPPED OUT OF A JP POINT!<br />
No one knows for sure except Blizzard as the current version of the PTR did a 1 to 1 conversion. <br />
<br />
In the end who cares which is right? 1 point either way isn't going to make a hell of a lot of difference given the prices on the PTR. The calculator provided by this site is a nice tool to do some quick calculations of what you'll end up with. If it is slightly off not a big deal. If Blizzard's formula is what MMO Champion has in their calculator (and not what they stated) are you going to complain that you ended up with 1 or 2 less Justice Points than you were expecting? I think the best case scenario would be that they would say they were sorry for giving false information. I just can't see them going back after the fact to adjust a few points.<br />
<br />
In any case Blizzard stated that the formulas they gave were all subject to change. So in the end the amount of Justice Points you end up getting could be much different than the 1 point you seem to be concerned about.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. The best you can hope for would be having enough points for half an epic, if that. A little shocked triumph and frost are worth the same, means cash in them primosars now.</div></div><hr />

Let me tell you this YES FARMING Triumph Badges now until Cataclysm comes out is Worth it. But Not to saved up to only Buy T10 which will easily get replace about 1-3 Quest into the New Expansion.<br />
<br />
So I'm tell you what I going to do Listen carefully, I going to Farm by ass off by healing heroics until Cataclysm comes out and if there's an Cap for badges I going to Downgrade them to the lower rank badges which is hero, then farm my ass off Again cap the badges to the next level rank of badges which is valor then after do the same for conquest and leave those badges there until Cataclysm. Thank you Blizzard for giving me the opportunity to make easy gold Now Give me my Gold is all I going to say with a big Koolaid smile, Because at the end of the day this whole New Justice system is really about Money=Gold because if it reward the gear you can buy now in WotLK it's consider useless, might as well grind your T10 Gear now. Forget Saving up for T10 you should already have most T10 pieces as long as the game been out and it also get replace by the new quest rewards in the expansion, now come on don't act like this never happens. Forget PvP Gear if it's possible to buy Wrath or Relentless still with the justice Point you gonna gain, If you really Saved Frost/Triumph badges for it your choice your lost. So why y'all figuring out the best Strategy to master the Justice Points system I'm gonna be farming heroics trying to cap every rank of badges from Hero-Conquest to earn that Big Doctor's Pay Check when Cataclysm hit. :)<br />

<br />
Prices on Frost Badge items end up being 1:1 with live so it doesn't matter if you spend your frost badges now or later (some items have different prices, though, like epic gems will cost ~18 badges instead of 15).<br />
since triumph badges use the same conversion ratio, they will be heavily upgraded in the process, which means spending them now would be foolish.<br />
Items from Vendors other than the Emblem of Frost Quartermaster are heavily overpriced since they follow the same pricing scheme as the Frost Items (iLvl 232 items cost about the same as iLvL 264)<br />
<br />
downgrading bagdes in order to have them converted to gold sounds fairly stupid to me, as it means ~25g per heroic run while one can easily make 150g/hour through dailies, not to mention other money-making activities.</div></div><hr />

Might sound fairly Stupid but from my point of view I rather saved the badges and downgrade them and wait for Cata for it to get converted to gold, because saving them for justice points just to buy frost badge Gear/T10 sound fairly stupid to me too. Now if there's an change and blizzard decides to mention there will be other gear beside the frost/t10 gear you can buy like iLvL 333 Cata gear from justice points then saving the badges for gold might be push over to the fairly foolish part but until blizzard mention that my goal is to get cap with badges in every rank from Hero-Conquest for Gold.</div></div><hr />
