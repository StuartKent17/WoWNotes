<h2 id="lightbound-undead-allied-race" class="heading-size-2">Lightbound Undead Allied Race</h2>
<p>While no new Allied Races are planned for 8.2, we've seen data appear for Allied Races&nbsp;<em>months</em>&nbsp;before they're implemented in-game, so perhaps this Lightbound Undead Allied Race is scheduled for 8.3. With Calia Menethil returning as a light-touched Undead in&nbsp;<em>Before the Storm</em>, and Derek Proudmoore&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news=290653/proudmoore-reunion-cinematic-8-1-5-war-campaign-spoilers">reuniting with Jaina</a>&nbsp;in 8.1.5, complete with a new model, many players speculated a new type of Undead race was on the way. Perhaps this race, raised with the Light, would stand with Calia and the Alliance instead of Sylvanas.</p>

<h2 id="lightbound-undead-allied-race" class="heading-size-2"><br /><br />The data shows the Lightbound Undead classes currently are:&nbsp;<span class="c3">Hunter</span>,&nbsp;<span class="c8">Mage</span>,&nbsp;<span class="c2">Paladin</span>,&nbsp;<span class="c5">Priest</span>,&nbsp;<span class="c4">Rogue</span>, and&nbsp;<span class="c1">Warrior</span>.</h2>

This patch doesn't just have Light customizations, but Void options as well.<br /><br />We've seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guides/story-of-battle-for-darkshore">Night Warrior tint</a>&nbsp;for Night Elves in Patch 8.1, and now more skin tints for older races are coming in a future patch, once again tied to Warfronts. Today we've datamined Void-Touched appearances for both Humans and Orcs, unlocked by winning the upcoming Barrens Warfront 10 times in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=13513/barrens-chat">Barrens Chat</a>&nbsp;achievement.</h2>
