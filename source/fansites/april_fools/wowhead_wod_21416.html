Garrison Bonfire Bonanza
Many players have been curious what will happen to our Garrisons in Legion. Will we hand them off to our most trusted follower, or will the Garrison suffer an attack?

The mission (Mission #826) offers some answers. Your Garrison is set on fire and your followers celebrate before making their great escape by...what else? Completing a mission. Your followers go up against the Shipyard, Mine, and Salvage Yard--while the Shipyard comes with naval threats they can't counter, their escape will be successful as the start chance is at 100%.
