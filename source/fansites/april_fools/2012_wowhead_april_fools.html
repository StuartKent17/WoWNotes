<h2 id="legendary-rare-spawns">Legendary Rare Spawns</h2>
<h3 id="traveling-merchants-sell-legendary-reskins">Traveling Merchants Sell Legendary Reskins</h3>
<p id="garrison-bonfire-bonanza" class="heading-size-2">While looking for wild pets added in this patch this weekend, Perculia and I found two very mysterious vendors on the roads in Duskwood and Burning Steppes!<br /><br /><strong>Kayle</strong>, a Blood Elf, sold us a&nbsp;<strong>Corrupted Thunderfury</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span class="moneygold">68,342</span>&nbsp;which was&nbsp;<a class="q5 icontiny" href="http://mop.wowhead.com/item=19019"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120508164826/http://wow.zamimg.com//images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_sword_39.gif" align="absmiddle" />&nbsp;<span class="tinyicontxt">Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker</span></a>'s model with a purple tint. After selling it, she disappeared into the shadows, saying she would be back again next night. It's also worth noting that we could transmogrify it, which I've included a screenshot of.</p>
<p class="heading-size-2">Meanwhile&nbsp;<strong>Master Zilean</strong>, a Dragonkin, had&nbsp;<strong>Time Tarnished Warglaives</strong>&nbsp;which sold for&nbsp;<span class="moneygold">66,634</span>&nbsp;each. These ended up red recolors of the&nbsp;<a href="http://mop.wowhead.com/itemset=699">The Twin Blades of Azzinoth</a>. He too disappeared after selling the item--we didn't see them up later that day, so perhaps they share the same spawn timer as rare mobs.</p>
<h3 id="new-world-boss-shyvana-the-unforgiving">New World Boss: Shyvana the Unforgiving</h3>
<p class="heading-size-2">It looks like there will be a Sha world boss that spawns based on your faction's dominance in PvP called&nbsp;<strong>Shyvana the Unforgiving</strong>.<br /><br />The entire encounter seems to revolve around regret for fueling violence between the Alliance and Horde. Of course, this makes sense--the Sha, after all, grows more powerful with conflict and PvP would definitely fall under that category. The more kills a faction has over the opposite faction on a realm, the more likely the chance that Shyvana will spawn in a capital city as hostile towards the entire faction.<br /><br />The boss has a few abilities we've managed to piece together:&nbsp;<a href="http://mop.wowhead.com/spell=129289">(Spell #129289)</a>&nbsp;as a soft enrage timer and&nbsp;<a href="http://mop.wowhead.com/spell=129425">(Spell #129425)</a>&nbsp;will occasionally hit tanks. It also seems to inflict its enemies with the shame of killing others--<a href="http://mop.wowhead.com/spell=129322">(Spell #129322)</a>--throughout the fight and banish them, rendering them useless to their cause, so you'll need a large raid to be prepared.<br /><br />After killing it, players gain&nbsp;<a href="http://mop.wowhead.com/spell=129876">(Spell #129876)</a>&nbsp;which lets them actually interact with the opposing faction. Since this has been requested for years especially with the rising popularity of Real ID, it seems like a fun way to make it a temporary perk.<br /><br /><strong>Shyvana the Unforgiving</strong>&nbsp;also likely drops&nbsp;<a href="http://mop.wowhead.com/item=89865">(Item #89865)</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://mop.wowhead.com/spell=129645">(Spell #129645)</a>) as a mount, as it's been stated that the new world bosses will have unique mount drops.</p>
