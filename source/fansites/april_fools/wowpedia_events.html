<h2><span id="Unique_events" class="mw-headline">Unique events</span></h2>
<p>A number of one-time-only World Events have occurred throughout the game's history. Most of these events have either directly resulted in changes to the game world or were pre-cursors to expansion packs. They are distinguished from&nbsp;<a title="Category:Removed from World of Warcraft" href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Category:Removed_from_World_of_Warcraft">removed content</a>&nbsp;by the fact that they were planned to last only a short time after release (at most one major&nbsp;<a title="Patch" href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch">patch</a>) rather than being removed due to either considerations for new content or gameplay concerns, updates, and other fixes. Note that simply being introduced and removed quickly (e.g. a quest added in&nbsp;<a title="Patch 3.3.5" href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_3.3.5">patch 3.3.5</a>&nbsp;and removed for&nbsp;<a title="Patch 4.0.3a" href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_4.0.3a">The Shattering</a>) does not qualify something as a One-Time Event or part of one - it must be related to a unique period or occasion.</p>
