    <h3><span id="Durability" class="mw-headline">Durability</span></h3>
    <p>Item durability is now in the game. Item durability is an important aspect of World of Warcraft that will work to stabilize the economy, decrease inflation specifically in the high end game, and in general keep prices of player sold items lower than normally would occur without such a feature. Durability should also add additional depth to the game since players will have more variety in their items and more abilities will be added over time to interact with durability. Item durability is different from item decay in that players will never lose items through item durability.</p>
    <p><u>Durability key points</u></p>
    <ul>
    <li>All armor and weapons have durability, but not trinkets, cloaks, shirts, guild tabards, necklaces and rings.</li>
    <li>Items remain at full effectiveness until they have no durability. Their power does not degrade.</li>
    <li>Items cannot permanently break.</li>
    <li>All armor/weapon vendors can repair durability in exchange for cash.</li>
    <li>When an item reaches zero durability, it no longer gives the player any benefit; it acts as though it does not exist until repaired.</li>
    <li>Professions cannot repair durability, but we will discuss ways for the professions to interact with them in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span id="Raid_Groups" class="mw-headline">Raid Groups</span></h3>
    <p>Raid groups will no longer receive quest bounties and collections. In the future, we plan to have raid-specific quests that will be possible to complete in raid groups.</p>
