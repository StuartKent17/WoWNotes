    </ul>
    <h4><span id="Warlocks" class="mw-headline">Warlocks</span></h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Improved Drain Mana - Damage caused is now considered Shadow damage and is no longer reduced by armor.</li>

    <li><a title="Enrage" href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Enrage">Enrage</a>&nbsp;- Increased the number of charges to 12. Decreased the duration to 12 seconds.

    <li>Krinkle Goodsteel of Gadgetzan submitted a complaint to the local Repairer's Union and has had his ability to repair durability reinstated.</li>
    <li>Brave Wildrunner of Bloodhoof Village in Mulgore no longer patrols through the kodo mounts.</li>
    <li>Added new load screens for Deadmines, Wailing Caverns, Uldaman, Razorfen Downs, and Zul Farrak.</li>
