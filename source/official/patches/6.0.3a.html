    <p>Warlords of Draenor is now live!</p>
    <p>It is the era of an Old Horde, forged with steel rather than fel blood. A union of great orc clans, the Iron Horde, tramples the planet Draenor beneath terrifying war machines. Azeroth falls next. Worlds uncounted will follow. You must mount a desperate charge on Draenor &ndash; savage home of orcs and adopted bastion of stoic draenei &ndash; at this pivotal moment. Your allies are legends from across time; your fortress a foothold in an alien land. Lead the armies of one world against another&hellip;before the future itself is unmade.</p>
