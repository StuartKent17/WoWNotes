<p>Patch 2.0.5 was initially released on the morning of January 14, 2007. However, due to authentication issues, some players were not able to log on.&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Blizz" href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Blizz">Blizzard</a>&nbsp;altered the servers to allow players with and without the patch to continue play the game. Those who have patched to 2.0.5 may be stranded as there is no rollback procedure for the game client.</p>
<p>The problem stemmed from a change in authentication.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.0.5#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;Under the new patch, the authentication servers would only allow clients with the&nbsp;<a title="Burning Crusade" href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Burning_Crusade">Burning Crusade</a>&nbsp;installed, of which publicly, there were none at the time.</p>
<p>Hours later, Blizzard announced that the problem has since been fixed, and that clients 2.0.4 and 2.0.5 could coexist.&nbsp;<a title="Patch 2.0.6" href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.0.6">Patch 2.0.6</a>&nbsp;was released the following week.</p>
