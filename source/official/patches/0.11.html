    <h3><span id="New_Model_&amp;_Animation_System"></span><span id="New_Model_.26_Animation_System" class="mw-headline">New Model &amp; Animation System</span></h3>
    <p>There have been extensive changes made to the model and animation system in order to increase performance while playing in densely populated areas (such as cities and PvP encounters). Specifically, we have added hardware vertex shader support and a hardware cursor for those cards that support it. Because we are still transitioning to the new system you will experience some incomplete animation features or graphical glitches while playing this patch. Please report any issues you may find using the /bug command from within the game.</p>
    <h3><span id="New_Looting_Methods" class="mw-headline">New Looting Methods</span></h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Group Loot</li>
    </ul>
    <dl>
    <dd>When an item equal to or above the threshold (details on threshold below) is on a monster that is killed, everyone gets a pop-up box on their screen with the item and pass or roll options and a timer. Anyone who rolls, displays a number between 1 and 100, the highest roller of all those who choose to roll automatically gets the item. Anyone who waits until the timer expires automatically passes. Items below the threshold are taken care of by normal round robin rules.</dd>
    </dl>
    <ul>
    <li>Need Before Greed</li>
    </ul>
    <dl>
    <dd>Same as group loot, except players who cannot use the item automatically pass.</dd>
    </dl>
    <ul>
    <li>Threshold</li>
    </ul>
    <dl>
    <dd>This just determines the level of items that are affected by the methods above. If a party wants to set the threshold to blue items and are in group loot mode, then green items that are found will be taken care of by the normal round robin rules.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3><span id="Warlock_Talents_Added" class="mw-headline">Warlock Talents Added</span></h3>
