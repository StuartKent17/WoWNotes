<h2><span id="Lore" class="mw-headline">Lore</span></h2>
<p>The deeds of every great hero inspire countless songs of triumph, virtue, and epic adventure. But although a hero&rsquo;s glory endures in song, the creators of those songs are seldom remembered. After ages spent singing of the heroic exploits of others, the bards of Azeroth are finally stepping into the spotlight on their own terms, proving once and for all that while just about anyone can pick up a sword or cast a spell, only a true hero can vanquish evil with the power of ROCK!</p>
<p>The time has come for the bards to claim glory for themselves. No longer will they remain shrouded in obscurity while less-talented adventurers are hailed by the masses.</p>
