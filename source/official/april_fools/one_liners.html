<p>We&rsquo;re excited to announce that the official Blizzard websites are now fully localized for murloc players everywhere. One benefit of countless failed attempts at establishing peaceful relations with various murloc tribes is that we have finally unlocked the secrets of Nerglish syntax and grammar. Thanks to this breakthrough in human-to-murloc communication, murlocs everywhere will now be able to engage with their human counterparts on equal footing.</p>
<p>Murlocs: simply install the Nerglish Translator bookmarklet and get ready to surf our sites in your native tongue!</p>
<p><strong><u>HOW TO INSTALL</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1&mdash;drag and drop</strong>&nbsp;the translator link below onto your browser&rsquo;s bookmarks bar</li>
<li><strong>Option 2&mdash;manual Installation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Copy the translator link&rsquo;s code to your clipboard</li>
<li>Open your browser&rsquo;s bookmark manager</li>
<li>Create a new bookmark and paste the link&rsquo;s code into the bookmark&rsquo;s URL field</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! Now you can use this bookmarklet to translate any Blizzard page into Nerglish. In the hallowed and inspiring words of Morgl, &ldquo;MRRRGGK!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The introduction of Wisps allows a new and exciting game mechanic: permanent death. The ability that destroyed Archimonde is available to all Wisps as a racial ability. This power, Detonate, destroys the Wisp in an explosion of energy, sapping the mana of all surrounding adventurers, friend and foe alike. This should provide an extremely interesting addition to the many adventures of&nbsp;<em>Warcraft</em>, particularly when pitted against other players!</p>
<p>Racial Traits:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detonate:</strong>&nbsp;Destroys the wisp, dispelling all magical buffs and draining 50 mana from each unit in an area around the wisp.</li>
<li><strong>Gatherer:</strong>&nbsp;Skill to herbalism, mining, and skinning increased by 10.</li>
<li><strong>Permanent Death</strong></li>
<li><strong>Treeform:</strong>&nbsp;Turns the wisp into a tree for 30 seconds. During this time, spirit is increased by 300. However, the wisp's chance to dodge or parry axes is reduced by 50%.</li>
</ul>
