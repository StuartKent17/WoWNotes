<h2><span id="Companion_App_Update:_Findr" class="mw-headline"><a title="World of Warcraft: Companion App" href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/World_of_Warcraft:_Companion_App">Companion App</a>&nbsp;Update: Findr</span></h2>
<p>Find your next tank, healer, or damage dealer at a glance with the latest update to the WoW Companion App: Findr. When you open the Findr feature, you'll be presented with a picture and a brief description of another player, and you can decide whether they'd be the right match for your party. Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Glance at a player's gear and achievement points for 3 seconds (maximum) before making a snap judgment about how well they'll tank your Mythic Keystone run.</li>
<li>Swipe right to request a match and immediately send a party invitation.</li>
<li>Swipe left to completely dismiss the player's entire existence; this is completely anonymous, distancing you from the other player's growing vortex of self-doubt.</li>
<li>Once a match has been made, option to not message them right away, which makes it look like you're super busy and use Findr all the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the time is right, gather your new groupmates together, and head off to whatever adventures lay in store!</p>
