    <li>A new launch utility has been created to enhance your entry into&nbsp;<a title="World of Warcraft" href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/World_of_Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>! The&nbsp;<strong>Blizzard Launcher</strong>&nbsp;will provide up-to-date news and important event &ndash; and support &ndash; related updates. In some regions, the Blizzard Launcher also scans for Trojan viruses and third party cheat programs and notifies you if it has located any on your machine. In addition to providing you with the benefits of additional anti-virus protection, the scan that the launcher conducts represents another security measure to protect your World of Warcraft account information and gameplay experience.
