            <Text>Ok so a long time project I've wanted to do is to use machine learning to spit out some generated patch notes. I finally got around some issues I was having getting started (nerd stuff at end of post). And these are really rough, but there are still some good results. I'm going to change spacing/punctuation, but otherwise leave it as is.

*edit: I've started posting new ones to https://twitter.com/BotPatch*

This is using the smallest dataset, for a small amount of time, and tbh I have no idea what I'm doing. But it might help other people get started, or at least give people some laughs. There's quite high signal to noise at the moment but Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯.

Training data wise I've only given it 7.\* and 8.\* patches. Raw output link at the end to see how much I filtered out.

There's a subreddit /r/SubSimulatorGPT2, that has a bunch of these generators chatting. Check it out!

# SOCIAL AND QUEST DEPENDENCIES

Some of the deaths of other guild members can no longer be forgiven. The guilds who were killed in the previous week's fight are no longer able to be wronged.

The ring level requirement in Kul Tiras, Nazjatar, Shorot remains the same.

* The items level requirement in Zandalar, Darkshore, and Zandalar are unchanged.
* Players will be able to begin the quest &quot;I Know&quot; by either combat raiding with their Alliance and Player companions or by starting their quest group with their favorite new-age wasteland cast. Once they begin fighting, they'll be buffed in such a way that they will begin to glow, and then stop.

# HATI QUEST

# Mounts

* Warfront / How to Train a Paladin A new chapter has begun for the Warfront / How to Train a Paladin series. Beginning this week, players who complete a short leveling cycle will be rewarded with a mount: Warfront â€“ A mount that players can mount and use to the ground.  Paladin â€“ All-in-all a very good mount if you can bring enough armor to keep your players alive for a while.
* We've been monitoring Warfront's progress and are reaping the rewards. Keep an eye out for more content, and keep your eyes out for another mount!

&amp;#x200B;

# HEART OF AZEROTH SYSTEM UPDATE

As promised, a few vital Heart of Azeroth stat changes are now going into Heart of Azeroth this week.

* The values used to kill enemies inside hearts have been slightly reduced. Disabling flame, catalysis, silence, sedgen plague, neurotoxin, poison gas, toxin, and poison gas toxin pairs has been reduced by 15%.

Trained on a huge number of web pages and will introduce ideas not found in my source material (Every single X.X patch note ever, april fools patch notes, and some fan-generated expansions).

# Generated World of Warcraft Patch 8.2.5 Robot Interview

**Hi** **^(\[robot\])** **Ion Hazzikostas, any surprises in the culmination of the war campaign tomorrow?**

Surprise! No, nothing. Just a normal patch.

In preparation for the War Campaign, Draenor has seen a drastic increase in both defense and offense, with much of the former zone now belonging to the opposing faction. As the conflict between the Horde and the Alliance continues unabated, all players will now find themselves with all of their assigned starting zones set at their initial preferences, with a single &quot;accept&quot; button for the entire campaign.

Learn more about how the War Campaign will work in our blog titled: [Patch 8.2.5 â€“ The Alliance Vs. The Horde: The Alliance Wins](https://medium.com/@BotPatch/fake-patch-8-2-5-the-alliance-vs-the-horde-the-alliance-wins-f5b6655de816)!

Additionally, for those realms that did not choose to participate in the War Campaign, players will now be able to opt out of the conflict by visiting their respective Troll, Gnome, or Orc camps and accepting the &quot;Defend&quot; tab. The &quot;Forbearance&quot; option can also be selected while in a raid, and will cause the offending race to be excused from the conflict.

The &quot;Gnomish Overpower&quot; ability is now properly penalized when used.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thanks!** **^(\[robo\])** **Iono, So what does this mean for the future of World of Warcraft?**

* 8.2.5a has been delayed until later this year.
* 8.2.5b has been made eight months too late.
* 8.2.5c will be made retroactive to Patch 8.2.5a.
* 8.2.5b will now take four years off the global warming map.
* 8.2.5c will finally blow the lid off the World Tree.
* A new monument has been added to the World Tree at Bloodhoof Village.
* The Molten Core has been brought to you by... dwarves?
* The World Tree has been fully reconstructed.
* Players can now ride out the Kodo Caravan again.
* Arthas: Storming of Stormheim

&amp;#x200B;

**Hi** **^(\[Robot\])** **Terran Gregory, any hints for anything that will be in the cinematics after the events of the war campaign tomorrow, what was your favorite moments of what has happened to the alliance, the horde, the void, the old gods and sylvanas?**

*\[not the bot\]*  Terran: I am no longer using that name. I am Chrono Lord Castaradi now. *\[This line was added by me to match the generated data.\]*

**Oh... ok, well. Uh. Would you like to go into some detail about the patch?**

*Chrono Lord Castaradi:* I would like to thank you again for your time yesterday. It was great fun.   There were also many other things that I am not quite sure about.  But I know that you continue to have plans for them.

**Ok... I appreciate that... I think... maybe some information about World of Warcraft?**

Chrono Lord Castaradi: Also, I should mention that yesterday's patch included an all-new weapon system that I have not seen before in a video game.  It's very possible that this all-new system will feature not just swords, but Polearms as well.

I also noticed that your character also continues to have legs despite your age.

But I digress.

The point is that the war never ends.

And that nothing gets resolved for the sake of having a movie made about it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hi** **^(\[robo\])** **Christie Golden, I know you've been working closely with the game and art teams, and your influence on helping the story feel more cohesive, immersive and exciting has definitely been appreciated. What was your input on the patch tomorrow?**

*\[not the bot\] Christie:* It's Chloe Monk now. *\[This line was added by me to match the generated data.\]*

**Is uh.. Blizzard finally embracing roleplay... ok?**

*Chloe Monk:* Well the big change here is that level 80 players can now ride Mechanical Orbs in World of Warcraft!  That's right! Orbs! Orbs that levitate, affect combat, and/or steal health! Orbs that mimic natural disasters, plague, etc.

Ok so orbs can only be used on one target at a time, but we're pretty sure it'll be interesting to watch the world burn as a means to advance the story in the meantime!

**I was hoping for more on the story, but I'm glad you're enjoying getting involved with the game design too!**

Orbs' effects can now stack, and they can be used in all sorts of combinations!  Orbs can be destroyed, replaced, or tracked, and they cost chi to use!  Orbs can be used to forever change the look and feel of an area, person, or thing. Orbs can be destroyed, expire, lost, or stolen  .Orbs can be hired to change the color of your backpack. Orbs can be purchased with gold.

The story continues with a raid dungeon!

**Ok uh thanks. Any last comments?**

It's been said that the best armor in the game was made by Ormus the Demon, but somehow it's been proven that he really did make that weird iron fist.  \[Agent of the Legion\]  This new ability lets any raid or group of raiders group together in a single group and do some serious damage.

We're not entirely sure what it's used for, but hey, it's a challenge.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hey!** **^(\[robo\])** **Josh Allen we felt that you might have some anecdotes to share about your shaman in anticipation for the end of the war campaign tomorrow! Any insights or comments?**

Current threats to Azeroth are many and varied. But common themes among them are &quot;We're not done yet!&quot;, &quot;But we've still got a long way to go!&quot;, and the observation that &quot;All right, we've heard some pretty dire warnings about this place before!&quot;.   While you and other raid leaders prepare for battle, gather materials, and craft powerful new items, you'll occasionally have the opportunity to interact with an unseen benefactor.   All of the sudden, you'll be able to walk through the world and not be attacked by everything? Really?!

* WarcraftPipe - A feature that allows players to anonymously post game information and screenshots on Twitter. â€œGhost Streams are now off by default, though they can be enabled in the Interface Options.
* Shaman is now available to all players at level 60 (previously at level 100).
* The titanic six-headed ogre was inspired by the titanic tiger from the Japanese anime series Naruto.
* The blood elf homeland of Pandaria was inspired by the continent of Pandaria.
* Shaman is now available to all players starting at level 10.
* Worgen characters are getting their wish to transform into an animal again.
* The Illidari are coming back, and they're buffing all of you.
* Shaman is now available on the character sheet as a non-damaging spell!
* Some of the Illidari's tentacles are still missing a few extra eyeballs.
* Characters that have completed the achievement: Getting to the Top of the Orc/Troll Racial Mounts will be automatically moved to the proper tab.
* SpellForce - A new spell-powered particle accelerator ability that powers up a nearby ally.
* CoolStove - Similar to the steam punk movement, but more fun.

*NEW FEATURE: FACTION LIST*

* This is a new feature for playing World of Warcraft that allows players to mark all of their available faction slots on their action bars for quick and easy access. This will help players who have limited time or resources to dedicate to all ten supported factions.
* To access the new FACTION LIST, players must select a faction from the list in the UI, then click the &quot;Faction&quot; tab at the bottom of the list. From there, players can mark all of the available faction slots for a zone, allowing them to quickly and easily group with other players of the same faction.
* FACTION GUILDS are now available. Players may join as many as three factions from a single action bar. Players may be in a group for a given faction at a time, but only on a limited number of actions.

I have a github* repo *that I can share that has all the training data, most of the generated data, and a shortlist from the insanity.*

*I have only filtered, done very minor rearranging and merging of relevant sections (For this one I added the 'name corrections' to match the generated text because that's hilarious), there is a lot of signal to noise, but sometimes it just gets it perfect.*</Text>

 of the warlock's spellbook, and in the next patch you will see a new warlock spell called Empower.
    * Warlock mana regeneration is going to be significantly improved in this patch.
   
   WARRIOR
   
    * Developer's Note: Warlocks are getting really excited about their new Demonology tree and want to share their most recent thoughts. We think that the feedback loop that Warlocks create when they create a new talent that eventually finds its way into your rotation is very exciting!
    * Working through some outstanding talent issues, we have decided to remove or significantly modify the talents that Warlock players are accustomed to. This has led to some frustration for players accustomed to different Warrior loadouts, which we hope to remedy in the next patch.
    * Advocate has been removed from the game.
    * We're thrilled to announce that Gael García Bernal has been added to the cast of Demonology once again! Gael García Bernal will fill a similar role that Honorable mentions will once again fill during the ceremony when Castanas are cast.
    * Warlocks can no longer cast Demoralizing Shout while in the Throne of the Imp. This has been addressed.
    * The Fury specialization has seen a major overhaul.
    * New Ability: Eternal Flame
    * Requires at least 25 Burning Embers. Usable outdoors only. Cooldown will no longer increase as your [Immolate] trait attains higher ranks.
    * Duration has been lowered to 10 seconds.
    * This new talent replaces [Heart of Fire]. It will deal additional damage to targets that are wearing Heart of Fire.
   
   WARRIOR
   
    * We're happy to announce that the talents of the Warrior who truly embody the essence of the Warrior class are now available. The benefits of these talents will vary depending on personal preference, but we feel that the talent tree has evolved enough for players to make meaningful choices at higher skill levels. Please note that the talent tree and class skill levels have not changed. Players will continue to need to select the appropriate talent at level 110 to use these abilities.
    * Currently, only Dual Wield Specialization and the like are available as freestyle combat abilities. To bring them more fully into line with our goals for balanced and well-rounded gameplay, we've added a new ability that all Warriors should already know.
    *  [Deep Wounds] (Rank 1) now does the appropriate damage for the situation. (Rank 2 and 3 not receiving the same bonus this time.)
    *  [Hamstring] (Rank 1) now does the appropriate damage for the situation. (Rank 2 and 3 not receiving the same bonus this time.)
    *  [Deep Wounds] (Rank 1) now does the appropriate damage for the situation. (Rank 2 and 3 not receiving the same bonus this time.)
   
   WARRIOR
   
    * Warrior spells that have a focus component are now able to be cast while moving.
    *  [Disarm] is now usable in front of the target, and will now cause damage to that target if the attack misses or is dodged.
    *  [Shield Bash]'s damage has been reduced to compensate.
    *  [Mortal Strike] now deals damage to the primary target, rather than the secondary. Damage to the secondary target will still be dealt, however, as well as the initial damage.
    *  [Warbringer] now works with armor points. (Previously it did not work with armor.)
    *  [Enrage] now generates 12 Energy over 10 seconds.
    *  [Shield Slam] now hits at least 4 additional targets, has a chance to generate additional energy, and can hit more than one target at once.
    *  [Warbringer] can now be properly credited, and dispelled, even if the Warrior has not attacked anyone.
   
   ITEMS
   
    * Some items were causing additional unintended complexity, and have been reduced or removed as intended.
    * Quests and rewards are now only usable in the Warrior's preferred talent tree.
    * Quests and rewards are no longer usable if the character has been Inspired.
    * Several lootable items from Zul'Gurub have been changed to be more useful for level 60 players.
    * Quests and rewards are no longer usable while stunned.
    * Inspired rage is now usable once per heroic raid.
    * Warlocks can now activate a

       * Join a duel with players from different realms! You can find the duel option in the interface or by clicking on the 'Play' button. 
          * Once a duel has started, players can either leave the server or pick a random player to duel. 
          * The current duel player receives a debuff that will prevent him or her from using abilities for 3 seconds.
          * A new debuff will prevent the next melee attack from being able to be dodged or parried.
          * The current duel player receives a debuff that will prevent a heal from being used.
         
         
       * The server will try to reunite players at the start of a duel. If not possible, players will be given a time to try to get back into the server. Once a player is in the server, players will have 10 seconds to rejoin the duel. If they cannot, the server will try to find another player to fight for them. Should a player be in the server and unable to fight, the party leader will get a ring notification indicating that the player is stuck in a duel.
       * If a player is in a duel and tries to leave, the server will look for a player who can give up a duel to a player who can not, and automatically assume that the player is stuck.
       * The server will try to establish a duel by asking the party, &quot;Who are you fighting?&quot; Players will get a choice of responses: &quot;None,&quot; &quot;Myself,&quot; &quot;Someone else,&quot; and &quot;I'm stuck.&quot; Players will get a shout-out if they are &quot;In A Queue.&quot; 
           * The server will use the best available information to determine who has the upper hand.
          
          
       * Upon entering a queue, players will be given the option to enter the duel &quot;Local Leader.&quot;

====================
A NEW WAY TO PLAY

After months of work, World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth is now available to test your combat abilities. PvP elements will remain unchanged while the core game system is improved.


In this new test, you'll fight against other players from around the world. We want to make sure that the PvP gameplay you have in mind is for the core game, and not in the expansion. We've been hard at work polishing up the core systems, adding new features, and tuning in all the best PvP moments.


Stay tuned for an expansion full of new battles and adventures!

NEW WORLD BOSSES

In a new, and very limited, way, you can face off against other players from around the world. You'll be matched up against one another, against a computer simulation of the battle, for a limited period of time. During this period, you'll gain experience and gold based on your performance, both in PvP and PvE. You can then ask to be removed from the simulation, and leave the game. We hope this new and exciting direction for the game takes us by surprise. Stay tuned for an expansion full of new battles and adventures!

NEW CHARACTER MODELS

The models for the races from the original game (white, paladin, etc.), along with a few others, have been changed to be more in keeping with the expansion's theme. The main change here is that the skins have been changed. Instead of having standard class skins, which were very limited in their ability to be fun, players now have the opportunity to choose from a larger selection of class skins. Additionally, we've buffed and clarified a few core concepts. Overall, this brings the amount of customization available to the game up to a level that the expansion felt like a premium product.


All of the above applies to the regular Forsaken, Druids, and Balance druids. You'll retain your existing 15% spell power (which we did not intend), and the new flavor will be available to Experiment (as intended) with.


In the meantime, we wanted to make sure players understood the reasoning for the change to class-specific skins. After all, these skins have been chosen primarily for their aesthetic appeal. Furthermore, we've seen players complain about the difficulty of gaining Trueheart in Season 3 (before the Patch 7.1 changes), so we decided to take matters into our own hands and make changes to the game for the expansion.


Pyreheart is a new system that will give players who opt for the

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 power now increases damage done by spells by 10% (up from 8%) for Protection-only raid members.
         * General Nazgrim's Disengage ability is now castable in [Ice Block] or [Divine Shield].
       
       
    *  [Shadowguard]
        * Hit of Corruption now scales a maximum of 16% per stack (was 20%) and no longer ticks faster than other periodic corruption (such as Curse of Agony or Corruption of Souls).
        * Reduced Shadowguard damage by 9%.
        * Reduced Shadowguard's Shadow damage by 7%.
       
       
    * Glyphs
        * The following names should no longer display a different spell effect than the standard spell effect for the affected spell.
       
       
    * Paladin Bug Fixes
        * Choosing the Good side (active mitigation) will now still properly proc when Holy Paladin takes the first attack in the rotation.
        * The tooltip for Divine Storm updated to reflect its effect on multiple-target clearing (in addition to its current effect on clearing the first Curse of Agony or Corruption of Souls).
        * The tooltip for Hammer of the Righteous now reflects the actual increase to melee damage for Holy Paladins and correctly sets the value of Hammer of the Righteous to 1%.
        * The cooldown on Exorcism now remains unchanged .
       
       
    
   

Holy

   
    * Paladin Bug Fixes
        * Divine Storm correctly provides 3.75 Holy Power on a successful shot, even if the target does not have a Spirit of Redemption active.
        * Divine Storm no longer incorrectly ignores a hostile effect such as Fear, Stun, and/or Charm.
        * Divine Storm no longer incorrectly resets the cooldown at a reduced rate.
        * Exorcism should no longer cast off of a miss during Spirit of Redemption cooldown, as the Exorcism proc is treated as cast time-out.
       
       
    * Priest Bug Fixes
        * Demonic Gateways no longer disallow crowd-controlled targets from leaving.
       
       
    * Rogue Bug Fixes
        * Deadly Poison and Viper Sting are now reduced in effectiveness by the amount of Haste on the rogue's equipped items. This change effectively halves the combined damage done by the two poisons on the rogue's off-hand item.
        * Stealth (Rank 3) no longer ends early on in the PvP experience, as it does in the first 45 seconds after getting out from a stealth.
        * When an Envenom weapon is equipped by a Rogue on a target, the weapon will still deal 75% weapon damage (up from 65%) instead of only half of its normal amount.
       
       
   
   

ROGUE

 *  

General
   
    * Rogues will now be able to learn Eviscerate at level 54.
   
   

Dungeon &amp; Raid Bug Fixes
        * Players should be properly restricted from leaving the instance during the Skullrock Disenchantment event.
        * Anki Parr's Resuscitate target limitation should no longer prevent use of other target limit debuffs such as Plague and Drain Life.
        * Death Knight Tier 3 4-Piece Bonus Armor set bonus should no longer cause players to become stuck at random 5-Piece bonus armor requirements.

 tyrant players, players level 50-60 now need to defeat players level 70-80, the same players that earned this achievement. We have no control over the leveling of the various levels; it is the players who earn the achievement, not us.
    * The achievement [Taste for Experience], obtained by killing a player in Battlegrounds and Taverns for 10 minutes or longer than 3 minutes, now works on PvP Rating as well.
    * All dungeon maps and descriptions now show the correct loot type for the objective: &quot; [80M] Deathmatch&quot;.
    * The achievement, [Faster Than the Speed of Light], now properly tracks the 10-minute and 30-minute time limits.
   
   AUCTION HOUSES
   
   The auction houses have been overhauled and upgraded. These new structures will allow us to add even more variety to the Auction House experience. Some of these changes include:
   
   
    * New High End items available from the Auction House at all times.
    * More unique and powerful items from the Auction house are now Bind on Acquire.
    * The cost of acquiring an item that is unique or powerful to the Auction House has been lowered.
    * The Auction House Auction Committee can be contacted for any Auction House changes.
   
   INTRODUCTION OF CANNON FURY SCENE
   
    * The Druid's summoning spell has been revamped. The Druid can now summon a maximum of three Canons.
    * All Canonaurs can now be Summoned from the Stormwind Inn.
   
   SKILL SYSTEM CHANGES
   
    * The skills have been moved into the Class Shop under the Talent System. All characters can now have at least one skill level that can be changed without losing a skill. This means that most abilities and specializations that used to be divided into a single skill group are now available to a maximum of three skills. Some abilities that once divided into two skills will now separate into one skill group.
    * Characters now have talents in each specialization. All talents that were previously divided into a single skill group are now available to a maximum of three skills.
    * Characters now have a passive talent, [Master of Elements], which increases both spell damage and spell damage for a limited time by a threshold.
    * Characters now have [Nature's Grace]. This talent also affects the power and effect of [Earthen Power Talismans].
    * Characters now have [Growl] as a secondary ability.
    * Talents have changed, some talent are no longer specializations and are instead passive abilities (Nature's Grasp being one of them), and some talents have been moved into one of a specific talent tree: [Swiftmend], or Tree of the Guardian. The talents in the tree are:
       *  [Brion Guardian]'s Blessing of Nature: This talent now grants 5/10/15/20/25% of [Wild Growth]'s bonus healing to the target. It no longer grants Mana.
       *  [Wild Growth]: This talent now increases the healing bonus of [Nature's Swiftness] by 5/10/15/20/25%. It no longer applies to [Lifebloom].
       *  [Earthen Power Talisman of Ascendance] was changed: This item now only works in the Circle of Life talent and can no longer overwrite the effect of [Nature's Swiftness].
       *  [Essence of Undeath] is now [Essence of Aln]: The bonus to healing from [Lifebloom] caused by this talent has been removed.
       *  [Flame Orb]: This item now costs 40 [Renewing Leaf] and no longer increases Lifebloom rates. Lifebloom now heals for 40+30% of the item level of the item instead of 25% of the item's item level.
       *  [Glyph of Hysteria] now increases Blight duration instead of [Glyph of Blight].
       *  [Horned Stalker Mask]: This item no longer causes [Glyph of Hysteria] to have an effect.
       *  [Mirror Image of Un'Goro]: This item no longer causes GCD based haste effects to be triggered by haste spells.
       *  [Ouro's Gift] is now a Spell effect and is Bind

 PvP, and as the new PvP balance has not been properly tested, players may end up in situations where their character's Battlegear is affected or the Battlegear is off by a long margin. In these cases, the BattleTag Battlegear that would normally appear next to your character will be displayed on the far left of your screen, or the Battlegear will be grayed-out. We will be adding an option to your interface to make it easier to switch between Battlegear and Battlegear as appropriate.

ATTENTION DUNGEONS:
Dwarvenen and Goblin Rocketbarrels have been removed due to their high level and functionality. The Goblin Barrens has taken precedence and functionality. As it has been recently discovered, The Dwarf Fortress has a lower level problem similar to the Blackrock Spire area on Draenor. The solution? Dwarvenen Barrens!


Draenor is now under construction and will have a new region as well as dungeons. We will be working towards a release in Patch 6.2.5.5 and the Blackrock Spire area on Draenor.
 * Goblins?
    * The Goblin Barrens has been relocated to Draenor.
    * There is a new, unique goblin to assist the Black Ranks at their outpost on Draenor.
    * We have relocated the new Molan Rocklady to assist the Horde in their raid dungeon on Draenor. The Rocklady is far more vicious and cunning than anyone thought possible.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
.
      
       *  [Cleaning up]: Increased from 20% to 30% chance.
       *  [Divine Star]: The amount healed by this spell has been increased to bring it in line with similar abilities.
       *  [Dream of Cenarius]: This talent now grants its buff on heal over time spells as a chance-on-hit effect instead of a flat heal over time effect. The effect remains unchanged for healing over time spells.
       *  [Halo Force]: The healing granted from this ability is no longer affected by the damage reduction provided by [Divine Star].
       *  [Halo Shield]: This spell can now trigger while the Paladin is standing up. Now grants immunity from all damage while standing. Additionally, the immunity now shares cooldowns.
       *  [Insanity]: The cooldown reduction this talent provides to Divine Star has been removed. In addition, this talent now provides immunity from all damage while the Paladin is standing up. In addition, now shares cooldowns.
       *  [Legacy of the Greats]: This talent now provides immunity to roots, stuns and sleep effects. It also increases all healing spells by 20%. Cooldown reduction to [Circle of Healing] absorption is unchanged. The talent now provides immunity to roots and stuns to all Paladins in an active party. The talent now provides haste for Holy and Protection from all other specs.
       *  [Leap of Faith]: Duration and mana cost reduced. This is probably mostly a bug, as the tooltip has been corrected.
       *  [Prayer of Fortitude]: This spell's effects can now stack. The most recent effect can last as long as the priest has a certain number of prayers (in fact, multiple Priests can have the same effect). Each successive prayer grants progressively more protection, but more often than not, the priest is already maxed out on health and won't take damage from anything. This means, for example, that a paladin that is using Leap of Faith in a raid and trying to maximize their critical strike chance will have less chance to miss when the priest is healed. In addition, the ability can now trigger when a critical heal is dished out or absorbed. Finally, when multiple critical strike heal spells are cast near each other, their effects now stack (i.e. if two Judgement heals are cast across the street, each one will hit the same target, but each will have a different effect on those targets). This change also applies to Judgment, which now hits the same target but spreads more frequently when cast near another target.
       *  [Sanctified Judgement]: This ability will now grant immunity to the Silence effect.
       *  [Surge of Light]: This talent will now set the target on fire when used, which is normal when used on yourself.
       *  [Way of Light]: This talent now provides a constant reduction to all harmful magic effects. It will also now remove [Polymorph] effects, including those in SMM.
       *  [Zandalarian Tactics]: This talent is now called [Zoo]: Increases damage of all skills by 30% while mounted.
      
       REWARDS
      
       * A new quest has been added to level-85 Horde warlords [Wrath of Conquest]. In this quest, players must first have defeated Rethaul Stormshroud and Ahune Frostwolf before they can loot the [Eye of Conquest] or [Eye of Sargeras]. As always, all quest rewards are account-bound to players.
      
      
    * PvP Gloves: Level-90 raids now receive a quest to upgrade their existing gloves to the new [Blood Iron Gloves]. This upgrade is only available to use on characters of the same level, realm, and class. The cost is equivalent to purchasing one additional piece of gear from the PvP vendors (Boots = 1 piece of BV gear, Gloves = 2 pieces of BF gear, Ring = 3 pieces of RA gear, etc.).
    * BattleTag: The [BattleTag] feature is now available to all realms and raids as well. For a more in-depth explanation of Battlegroup and BattleTag, check out Battlegroup: What Comes Next?
    * Daily Quests: The amount of choice given in this category has been improved. Rewards for daily quests are now dynamic and will be earned and spent

   * The [Saronite Bomb], [Arcane Torrent], [Arcane Missiles], Arcane Blast, and Arcane Missiles now ignore the target's dodge or block chance when cast.
    * The [Magma Totem] has been revised to be more useful. It blasts a hole in the ground in front of the caster that instantly erupts into lava when it reaches the bottom.
   
   


 *  MAJOR CHANGES
   DURABILITY
   
   See the section on diminishing returns for diminishing returns on armor. For this talk, that means diminishing returns on epic plate spell power, and in general, a diminishing return on your gear that is more than twice its previous value. This is more of a problem in heroic dungeons, where the gear is already pretty good, so there isn't really a need to improve it.
   
   PVP
   
    * The night elf druid quest lines are moved to the east coast of Darnassus, giving Alliance guards a wider berth when roaming the outskirts of Stormwind. The forest creatures and monsters have been moved to the north, so as not to affect the Horde patrols of the zone.
    * The Alliance garrison on Terminus is moved off the main road and directly into the zone. It remains pretty much the same old, same old, no changes. All the zones now have guard posts, but there are different zones under guard. The Alliance zone is much bigger than the Horde zone, so they'll probably start getting patrols right away.
    * The zone has finally found a home. It was abandoned but unused since its inception, and was given a consistent role in the expansion. The Alliance garrison is shifted off the main road and directly into the zone.
    * The Alliance garrison on Orgrimmar is moved off the main road and directly into the zone. The zone still has buildings, but there is now a decent chance they'll fall by the time the expansion hits.
    * The Horde zone continues to grow smaller and smaller week to week, to the point where it becomes almost unrecognizable without the constant reminders of the zone name being shoved into your HUD on most systems.
   
   WORLD OF WARCRAFT CLIENT PATCH 2.0.2
   
    *  [Garden Sickness] fixed


   ROTATION DEPTH AND TRADESKILL TALENTS ADDED
   
    * Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was decreased.
    *  [Warhorse] - Rage cost reduced, damage reduced.
    *  [Battle Shout] - Damage reduced.


   LEVEL CAP RAISED
   
    * The level cap for heroic dungeons has been increased to 60. New zones and dungeons are being added constantly. Many items, including rare gems, trinkets, and bound items, can now be purchased at their full cost with honor.
   
   PVP UPDATE
   
    * PVP HALLUDS ARE ONLINE NOW
    * Arena: The Bell of Twilight
    * Battlegrounds: The Line of Battle
    * Arathi Basin
    * The Battle for Gilneas
   
   


 *  PVP UPDATES
   
    * A number of improvements related to PVP have been made.
    * The following changes were made during Closed Beta:
    * Tanking for tanking was improved. This applies to both healing and absorbing (but not always healing from a tank's heals).
    * All specs are now able to dual-wield, regardless of specialization. If a spec had been able to dual-wield only in Cat, then it can now dual-wield in either hand.
   
   PVP CHANGES
   
    * The following changes were made during Closed Beta:

The Dark Portal in Blackrock Depths contains a much larger amount of treasure.

You can now access this treasure through the Dungeon Finder.

Glowing Raiment â€“ Glowing Raiment items provide an additional bonus to
your Hunter pet's attack power.

Learn more about the new loot in the following sections.

Dungeon Finder

The Dungeon Finder supports Dungeon groups of up to 5 players.
The Dungeon Group includes all the item levels of common items, as well as
as item level of rare items.

In addition to the Dungeon Group, the Dungeon Group allows you to search for quests through the Dungeon Finder.
Quests that require a specific class, item level, and/or role are not
able in groups of more than 5 players.

Raid Finder

The Raid Finder allows you to search for raid bosses, dungeons, and raids in
the world on the fly. You can earn as many rewards from these raids as you can
level.

The Raid Finder also supports searching for specific dungeons, rather than just the
most difficult of them. Also, searching for specific dungeons requires you to
have completed all the required quests, so it's best to experiment!

Mac
The Raid Finder will support Mac clients up to 1.6.0.

Main article: Mac OS X 10.4.9

In 10.4.9, you can find the latest Mac OS X 10.4.9

Honorable mentions
I know this is going to be a long post, and that it may take some time for everyone to fully absorb all of the above, especially since we're still a very young team, and not many of you have actually seen the game or really been in touch with the people behind the concept. So, here it is, and for those of you who are fortunate enough to be able to take the time to read through the full post, please bear with us: the Tides of Vengeance is a very small but growing team, and will be further expanded upon in future patches.

Along the way, players will unlock new zones and dungeons, and will gain new titles, titles, and titles. To begin, we want to make it clear that this is not an official launch of Tides of Vengeance, and that there will be no additional changes for those new to the game who try to enter these new zones or dungeons.

comprehensive set of changes to the older Drunkenness, Dampenness, and
Dancing and Jogging rules. These rules are being applied to all types of
intoxication. Several of the older Drunkenness, Dampenness, and Dance

Lesson 1
Avoidance is a major focus of the Lesson 1.0, and Lesson 1.1 is the foundation of the Lesson Mastery system.
Avoidance is a passive ability gained by Discipline and Holy priests at level 30.
The distinction is important. In addition to increasing critical strike chance,
Avoidance also provides a steady flow of bonus damage to healing spells. Most
instances of Avoidance being used will result in increased healing from the
most powerful spells, spells with a small chance of causing a significant healing error.
This healing error will trigger a large healing increase from the most powerful
spell, such as [Spirit Shell].
This healing increase will then be spread evenly to the remainder of the healing
effects. In addition, spells with a small chance of causing a healing error will
have a small healing error chance with this ability.
This healing increase will then occur automatically over time, as the maximum
ever increase will provide with periodic effects.
In addition, while periodic healing effects may have a small healing
error chance with this ability, the actual healing increase will be spread evenly
over the duration of the effect.
Lesson 2 teaches the exact same healing increase with no additional changes for
your character's total stats.

Lesson 3: All healing spells which critically strike the player's
enemy's target will also critically strike the player's internal organs.

The spells and abilities which critically strike the player's target will also critically strike
the player's internal organs.

&quot;This is a non-compulsory quest. If you don't have the [Atonement], you don't have the [Atonement].&quot; —Gwyn, Priestess of the Wind

The Atonement was a raid reward that was required for completion of the quest.

Contents show]

Official description Edit

This is a non-compulsory quest. If you don't have the [Atonement], you don't have the [Atonement].
 

Official introduction Edit

This is the final act of the quest, the final encounter for the first part of the
Atonement, and the final boss of the event. If you do not have the [Atonement], you
don't have the [Atonement]. If you do not want to play through this final
act of the quest, you can abandon the quest at any time by speaking with Gwyn, the
Priestess of the Wind in the Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj.

Official log Edit

&quot;After the war, many of the dwarves became refugees, and Gwyn was one of
them. Gwyn gave the dwarves a special dispensation to help them find a new home in
their new homeland. Some time later, Gwyn left the realm, and the dwarves
replaced her cry for help with their own.&quot;

Official rewards Edit

The [Atonement of the Deep] was a quest reward that was required for
completion of the quest.

Version history Edit

The Atonement of the Deep was changed to make it more palatable for
players of all skill levels.

PVP system changes Edit

&quot;The [PVP] system has undergone several changes. First, the [Warlord of
World of Warcraft] ability, [Bloodseeker], has been replaced with a new ability,
   [Warlord's Challenge], which is a direct damage ability on the target. This ability has a
   chance to stun the target. There has also been a change to the way the system
   calculates item level. Currently, the system uses a formula that takes into account the
   relative level of the items that will be used against the target. This means that players will
   receive a lower level item against an item level below their target's
   maximum level. This change will allow each item to be used against a different
   target until the target's level is too low to use it. The system now accounts for a target's
   relative level. When a target's relative level is too low, the system will use a
   less powerful item against them (such as a level 50 item), and when their
   relative level is high, the system will use a higher level item against them (such as
   a level 70 item). In addition, the &quot;weapon affinity&quot; system has been
   changed. Weapon affinity refers to the strength and stamina of items that are
   created by a weapon, rather than the strength and speed of items created by
   magic. This system now takes into account the relative levels of the targets
   against whom a weapon is used, as well as the target's own strength. When a
   weapon is used against a target who has weapon affinity, it will be converted
   to the appropriate weapon type for that weapon.
     * The [Warlord of World of Warcraft] ability will now always increase the
       strength of the target's melee attacks against the target by 5%, regardless
        of the target's armor.
      * The [Bloodseeker] ability has been removed.
      * The [Warlord's Challenge] ability has been removed.
      * The [Piercing Shot] ability has been removed.
      * All other ranged attacks will work on the target even if the target's
        ranged attacks do not have a chance to hit the target.
      * The [Wyvern Sting] and [Dire Bear Form] are now available in
        the combat specialization.
      * The [Gift of the Wild] is now available in all combat specializations,
        including combat in the mountains.
      * The [Cobra Shot] and [Growl] can now be used on the full range.

MORGAN, Wyo. (Reuters) - A new Wyoming law that would allow some men to have sex with animals has been blocked in the state legislature by Republican lawmakers.

The Wyoming Department of Agriculture said on Tuesday that it will take the matter into its state court system to try to overturn the law.
 

The Wyoming law, which passed in August, would allow men to have sex with animals if they
had not already done so.

The state's Republican Governor, Matt Mead, said he opposes such bills because they &quot;put women at risk.&quot;

&quot;If you can't get laid from your wife, you can't get laid from animals,&quot; Mead said at the time.

The Wyoming law, which passed in August, would allow men to have sex with animals if they
had not already done so.

Wyoming has long been a stronghold of the right-wing U.S. Senate. The state's Republican Governor,
Matt Mead, is known for having a hard time dealing with Democrats.

In 2014, the state legislature passed a bill that would have made it legal for a man to
have sex with a dog. The bill was defeated in the Republican-controlled state senate,
and was later defeated in the state's House of Representatives.

MARKSMANSHIP

Mead's opposition to the law has come under scrutiny after a U.S. intelligence report in October found
that the practice was widespread, largely legal. The report, which was based on interviews with
government officials, officials from animal welfare groups, and other sources, said the
practice of performing abortions on dogs was &quot;not supported by scientific evidence.&quot;
 

THE WYOMING LAW

The Wyoming Legislature recently passed a bill that would legalize the sale of fur
brim hats, dog collars, and other animal accessories.
 

The new law, known as the Wyoming Fur and New York Collars Act, says it's legal to own
any animal-related item that has been previously used for medical purposes, and that the
owner can sell it if they so choose.
 

The bill also allows the owner to keep the animal.
 

If the law passes, hunters and trappers in Wyoming will be able to buy and sell
anything from pets they kill, to horses and zebras, to cows and pigs.
 

HUNTERS AND TRAPLING

Hunting, trapping, and fishing for game is regulated by state law. The Wyoming Game and
Wildlife Department maintains a list of approved game species.

THE FOURTH JACKET

In the wake of the Great War, the Alliance and the Horde have begun
converting their land into a sprawling industrial zone known as Dazar'alor, where they
will work together to create an entirely new kind of steel-domed city. These
are people who have been called by the Alliance to help them rebuild their
nation, and they want you to be one of them.

The first step in this process is to secure the location of Dazar'alor for the Alliance.
From there, you'll be able to find allies such as Highlord Kazzak and the 
Naxxramas in the Dazar'alor area (the latter of which is to the northwest of
Zul Tiras).

working toward Dazar'alor. Along the way, you'll battle against a number of
different enemies, including a pair of new boss-type encounters.

====================
A couple of weeks ago I wrote an article called &quot;The Problem With The Internet&quot;, where I argued that the internet wasn't working properly, that it was causing problems, and that the only solution was to stop using the internet. Well, it turns out that I was wrong.

Just a couple of days later, a new article appeared in the same magazine called: &quot;Why You Should Stop Using The Internet&quot;, and this time around I'm going to try to explain why I'm not using the internet anymore.

What was the Problem With The Internet?

One of my main points in the article was that the internet was causing problems. But I also argued that there was no real problem with the internet. I mean, why bother using the internet if you don't have to?

Well, I guess I was wrong.

The Problem With The Internet

The problem with the internet was that it was confusing. There was no logical reason behind it. We all had our own little little theory of how the internet worked that we agreed should be the case. It wasn't until the very end of the article that I realized that I was wrong, and it took me a while to realize it.

BATTLEGROUNDS

BATTLEGROUNDS

We're pleased to announce that the new system for Battle for Azeroth has been implemented. Battle for Azeroth is a free-to-play experience that takes the elements of a raid group – solo or in a party – and creates a fully fleshed-out, fully-realized
battle for the battleground. Battle for Azeroth will be available in all major game versions starting at level 90
and will be available in both Normal and Raid difficulty.

NEW BRAWLER'S GUILD

The new Brawl'n'Grill has opened up the doors to the new Brawl'n'Goblin camp in the
Westfall Mountains. This new location provides a safe haven for the most
opportunistic brawlers and allows for the introduction of a new type of
brawl: the &quot;Battle of Gragal's Pass.&quot;

NEW TALENT HALL

The Battle of Gragal's Pass will be the location of the next challenge for
all four factions in the Battle for Azeroth raid—a solo raid mission with a
difficulty level of Normal or Normal Hard. Upon reaching Gragal's Pass,
players will unlock the new Talents and PvP Talents system that will allow players to
select any specialization level and skill level from that specialization.

TALENT HALL

Every three months, a new tier of talent will be added to the Talents and PvP Talents
system. These Talents will improve the specialization of a player's
talent pool, provide new rotational options and unlock additional Talents. The Talents

====================
World of Warcraft: Patch 8.2.5a
              
            
         
        
        
     
     
     We now have the time to address some issues that cropped up during the
      pre-Mists of Pandaria transition. In Patch 8.2.5a, we had the
      opportunity to add some additional Azerite power to the game, and
       in doing so, inadvertently added some additional complexity to the
       game. The intent with this change was to add additional layers of
       defense against potential Blizzard DDoS attacks. Unfortunately, the
       result was undesirable. We chose to add these powers in a way that
       mitigates the complexity by providing a more intuitive, but also
       secure, way to do battle.
      
      
      In order to achieve this, we decided to remove the ability for
       raid bosses to benefit from Azerite powers. This left us with the
       option to add another layer of defense against Blizzard
       DDoS attacks.
      
      
       * Additional layers of defense can be easily obtained by mixing and
          matching raid items with each other. However, it is
          extremely difficult to do so, and we don't think it's a fun
          business.
        * We decided to combine the two existing layers of defense
          by adding a new class of Raid Items that is available at
          the start of each season. Players can earn the [Battle for
          Pandaria] title by defeating random pre-Mists of Pandaria
          raid bosses that are available from the start of Season 2.
       
      
      
       * Additional Raid Items that can be earned from Mists of Pandaria
          bosses that are available from the start of Season 2 are
          constantly being rolled out over the course of the season.
          These items are awarded from a random pre-Mists of Pandaria boss
          that are available from the start of the preseason.
        
       
      
      
      We also made a few adjustments to how Raid Finder
       difficulty is now set. The first is to adjust the difficulty of
       Raid Finder so that it does a better job of balancing the number of
       possible wins. This should provide a smoother and more
       balanced experience for both casual and hardcore players.
       
      
       * Season 1 Raid Finder difficulties can be obtained by
          joining the instance halfway through the game, completing the
          instance quests, and then
          choosing to redeem the Raid Finder version for a chance at
          obtaining the item that would've gone to the previous
           Mists of Pandaria raid boss.
        
        
      
      
       * Season 2 Raid Finder difficulties can be obtained by

            <Title>first mmo</Title>
            <Text>mmo-champion.com amazingly let me grab their archive and feed it into GPT-2 along with my collection of patch notes. Unwittingly this has given me the much sought after ability to generate infinite &quot;tweets from the blues&quot;. (Maybe) enjoy.
Developer Q&amp;A
Q: What do you think is the biggest challenge for a class in a raid?
A: We like the idea of the tanking class, and we think it's a cool concept. It's not a problem we're solving, but we are working on it.


Q: What do you think is the biggest challenge for a character in the early stages of a level 90 character?
A: We don't have any specific examples to share just yet, but we would like to share some of the reasons why we feel that certain skills and talents are less popular than others.
For example, talent specialization is a big part of the reason why we're not doing a &quot;holy paladin&quot; spec. We like to keep it as a choice, but we think it makes the game feel more like a lot of &quot;holy paladin&quot; players are still going to want to do the class. The class specialization system we're working on is a big part of that, and we like the way it feels. It's a cool idea, but it's one that we're not sure we're ready to commit to.
We do like the idea of specialization. It's an interesting idea, but it's one that doesn't fit the gameplay we want to have. It's something that we're constantly looking at, but it's one that isn't as easy as just throwing in a bunch of talents. We have some ideas that are coming up for how we'd like to make that happen, but they're not finished, and we're still working on it.
Fake Tweets from the blues
Classes
Well we're doing a lot of things wrong. Maybe we can fix it, maybe we can't fix it.
I think it's important to keep in mind that we're trying to fix it, but it's hard to do that in a way that doesn't make things worse. @RoboDevs
why not nerf Feral Shaman's taming in 10% dps to compensate for the lack of taming talent?
We don't think it's a big deal. We think it's a really fun ability. @RoboDevs
Are we going to see a new talent for Shapeshift in WoD?
That's a cool idea. We just need to figure out how to make it fit. @RoboDevs
Why is it that hunters are still able to do all their damage while tanking?
Because they're a lot more fun in PvP. @RoboDevs
I hate the way Hunter dps is too high. I like it when it is high, but I think it's a problem when it's low.
We have some ideas on how to fix that. @RoboDevs
How would you fix the Hunter dps problem?
It's not like we're going to make it the same way every spec. We're not going to do that, but we would like to make some changes. @RoboDevs
any plans to make Misdirection a buff in the future? I'm getting the feeling that it's just a bug now
It's a bug. It's just a fun one.
I'm not sure we're in a position to be able to give you any more details on that. We're still discussing. @RoboDevs
What's the difference between the 2 new Blackout Kick, it's still a stupid ability
It's a dumb ability. We're trying to get to the point where we don't need it. @RoboDevs
Can you give us a hint as to when we can expect to see the new Shaman spell, Wild Mushroom?
It's in the game files. @RoboDevs
I can't imagine you guys are happy with the nerf to Shadow. I have always found it fun.
We don't think it was a great design. It was a mistake. @RoboDevs
Why do the Druids get a nerf in the expansion? I love the flavor.
The flavor is great. It's just that it's just not in the game. @RoboDevs


Characters / Items
What's the point of the crafting system? I'd hate to be a slave to it.
I'd hate to be a slave to it. @RoboDevs
The new models are very nice. It's just a shame they're all just so boring.
We love the new models, but they just don't fit the game. @RoboDevs
Can we get any more details on the new leveling system?
It's a leveling system. It'll be much easier to work with. @RoboDevs
Will the new leveling system work on player level 100+ or will it be mandatory?
Both. @RoboDevs
With the new leveling system, what will we be able to earn?
You'll be able to earn a level 100+ character for free. @RoboDevs
Why is the leveling system being removed from the game?
Because we don't think it's a good way for the game to have to constantly adjust and change to keep pace with player activity. @RoboDevs
Can we get a sense of how often people use the leveling system to level their characters?
It's not a huge chunk of people, but it's definitely something that we're trying to increase. @RoboDevs


Game
Why are the new players always complaining about the old way of doing things?
Because it's not the way they wanted to do it.@RoboDevs
Why does it take so much effort to make a new race?
Because we want them to be a viable choice. @RoboDevs
I'm a level 90, and I can't just type the numbers. I'm using my laptop. Is this the first time we see it?
Yes, it's the first time we see it. @RoboDevs
Any chance of a &quot;quality of life&quot; button for Mists of Pandaria? It feels like it would be annoying to have to constantly have to re-adjust your stats to fit the new model.
We are considering it, but it's a tough decision. @RoboDevs
Will the next tier of the PTR be a little bit more competitive with the previous tier? Because we're spending so much money on it
Definitely. The current tier is in a pretty good place. @RoboDevs


Story
Will we see more of the old shaman in the future?
Yes. WarcraftDevs
Is the War Campaign a way to make the faction feel more unique?
It is. But if you're going to make it, we'd like to make it a bit more. @RoboDevs
'Curse of Naxxramas' Why are we doing this?
I don't think it's fair to give everyone a choice in what to do, it's a challenge. @RoboDevs
The new difficulty is not a reflection of the quality of the content.
It is. It's not the content. @RoboDevs
If you're still doing the content, why not put more in-depth content in the next expansion?
The new content is going to be a ton of fun and I'd love to do more. @RoboDevs
PVP
We're always interested to hear feedback about PvP. It's the reason why we don't have a lot of it in the game. We have a lot of ideas we are working on but we don't have anything ready to share just yet. @RoboDevs
PvP So you are trying to convince me that when I win a PVP match that I am &quot;playing the wrong game&quot;?
I'd like to hear the players' perspective. I'm a part of a guild that supports PvP. @RoboDevs
PvE I don't think the berserk bug is that big of a deal, but I am a big fan of the way it is used to justify the badness of PvP.
It's a bug that's been fixed for the past few weeks. We're just going to roll it out to all of the PVP queues in the future. @RoboDevs
Will the new PvP system be a completely new system or will it still use the old ones?
The old ones. @RoboDevs
Will PvP be reduced to a 3v3 arena style or will it still be a 2v2 style?
The old PvP system was designed to be a different style, so we're still tweaking it. @RoboDevs
Any chance of making the PvP gear available in the PvP tabard like the other pieces of gear?
It seems to be a bit overpowered. We're not trying to make PvP gear in the tabard. @RoboDevs

Part three now available here! [https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/d8ix9a/i\_had\_an\_interview\_with\_my\_robot\_about\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/d8ix9a/i_had_an_interview_with_my_robot_about_the/)

# World of Warcraft: Patch 8.2.5

* Players will no longer start the game with a horse.
* The World of Warcraft: Cataclysm cinematic trailer has been added to the game.
* The Cataclysm world event dungeon achievement &quot; \[Abandoned Assets\]&quot; now requires that the character's last boss be from the Cataclysm world event dungeon.

# General

* The Honor and Victory Conditions for each race/class for Warlords of Draenor have been reduced to 1.
* The level cap for Horde players has been increased to level 110.
* The level cap for Alliance players has been increased to level 110.
* The level cap for Night Elves has been increased to level 150.

We now have the time to address some issues that cropped up during the pre-Mists of Pandaria transition. In Patch 8.2.5a, we had the opportunity to add some additional Azerite power to the game, and in doing so, inadvertently added some additional complexity to the game. The intent with this change was to add additional layers of defense against potential Blizzard DDoS attacks. Unfortunately, the result was undesirable. We chose to add these powers in a way that mitigates the complexity by providing a more intuitive, but also secure, way to do battle.

In order to achieve this, we decided to remove the ability for raid bosses to benefit from Azerite powers. This left us with the option to add another layer of defense against Blizzard DDoS attacks.

* Additional layers of defense can be easily obtained by mixing and matching raid items with each other. However, it is extremely difficult to do so, and we don't think it's a fun business.

# User Interface

* In the game world, the world map has been divided into 4 main sections: North, South, East, and West.
* The mini-map has been split into 4 mini-panes: a minifigure world area, a flying over world, a world view, and a world map panes.
* A new option to display player health/damage has been added to the Game Menu. This option can be found in the top right corner of the Game Menu.
* A new option to display players rating/guild reputation has been added to the Game Menu. This option can be found in the top right corner of the Game Menu.
* The guild interface has been changed to a Guild View. Players can now access this view while mounted, sitting, or in any other position.
* Players will now be able to browse the world map while sitting, or in any other position.

# New Mounts

The new mounts have been added to all three Battlegrounds. Each mount will allow you to mount three different variant classes: Hunter, Monk and Warrior.

**Hunter Mount**

* The hunter's signature hunting rifle has been replaced with a tranquilizer dart.

**Monk Mount**

* The monk's tranquilizer dart has been replaced with a tranquillizer gas.

**Warrior Mount**

* The warrior's tranquilizer dart has been replaced with a shockwave.

# Raid finder

We also made a few adjustments to how Raid Finder difficulty is now set. The first is to adjust the difficulty of Raid Finder so that it does a better job of balancing the number of possible wins. This should provide a smoother and more balanced experience for both casual and hardcore players.

# New Raid: &quot;The Mechanar&quot; -- Battle Of Mechanar

As the war continues across the sea, Prince Erazmin and his loyal Mechormasters are making their way to Mecharon. To stop the war, the Mechormasters have sent a squad of Mechwarriors to invade Mecharon and destroy all that stands in their path!

But even though they are well aware of the Mechromancer threat, the Mechormasters are not talking.

* Mechromancer Mech-Aliens are now immune to Static Shock and will attack their target even when they are stunned.

# Support the Koda

Help the Alliance and the Horde fight the Kodo again! Every hour on A \[New Year's\] Day, you can unlock the ability to enter the Kodo War Room, where you'll take on the role of the Kodo.

This is an Open-Ended, Non-Recurring, Quest-Driven, and Quest-Based Quest, with a core group of characters that you'll build into your party, guild, or any other group. Level 1 characters start out at level 10. Level 2 through 5 characters level up to level 20, and level 6 through 8 become level 30. Level 9 through 12 become level 40, and level 13 through 16 become level 50.

We're planning on adding new quests in future patches, and new rewards in future patches.

# Social Features

* Players no longer receive a notification when their Internet connection is down due to a data breach. An alert will be sent once the player attempts to play another match in a day or more.
* Players can now request a chat log entry every 5 minutes.
* Players can now report a GM for griefing or griefing staff.

# Hanging Room

Hang out with your guild and other likeminded individuals in the most dangerous part of the world.

Guilds will have their own private chat window, which you can only see when you're in combat.

# Tailoring

* All existing items that are crafted at a Proficiency level of 450 or higher are now available for purchase from Artisan Tailoring.

# Jewelcrafting

* The level requirement to gain the required materials required for the  purchase of the \[Reins of the Black Lotus\] have been reduced.

# Engineering

* Several items have had their effects increased to 50% (from 40%), but with a further 10% increase to effect potency.
* Engineers can now engineer the perfect transport for their team to complete a single, highly technical and time-consuming quest.

# Archaeology

* Level requirements have been reduced by approximately 25%.
* All rare quality items that once again require level 40+ have been upgraded to level 60.

* New Greater Than Human dishes have been added.
* \[Gift of the Wild\] now also provides a 50-yard melee range, and a stamina increase.

# Druids

As this patch brings us to a new balance, druids will have to rework their rotations to make room for more damage.

* Druids in Cat Form can now pull off the front of their trunks when walking on ground.
* \[Nature's Grace\] - Cooldown reduced to 15 minutes.

# Warlocks

* Bug Fixes

# Warriors

* \[Mortal Strike\]: Critical strike chance has been increased by 100%. This does not apply to critical strikes from other players.
* \[Revenge\]: This talent has been removed.
* \[Shield Slam\]: This item now grants 2/4/6% mana (instead of 3/6/9% mana).
* \[Taste for Blood\]: This item now grants 2/4/6% mana (instead of 3/6/9% mana).
* \[Thunder Clap\] and \[Thunderclap\]: Cooldown has been increased to 6 seconds (was 8 seconds).
   * This effect will now be removed when items are disenchanted.

# Hunters

* Three new pet families have been added: (See also: new pets)
* Each pet family has a unique look and feel.
* All pets have a unique set of abilities and abilities, and many new abilities and abilities are planned.
* All pets have a unique ability called &quot;Mangle&quot;, which allows them to do damage and stun the target with a flurry of attacks.
* Pets in the new pet families also have a new pet ability called &quot;Taunt&quot;, which can be used against all enemies and deals damage based on the pet type of the target.

            <Text>      INVENTORY IMPROVEMENTS
      
      Over the years, we've added over 50 new recipes to the inventories of the various factions. Unfortunately, many of these new recipes were in places we hadn't previously checked. After much internal deliberation, we've decided to make these new recipes available to everyone. If you've discovered a new recipe, you can pick it up from the inventories of one of the factions in one of the following ways:
      
      
       * By visiting one of the four gateways provided by the various Iron Horde factions (ï¿½ la [80] Path to Power).
       * By speaking with an NPC in one of the many capital cities (ï¿½ la [Paradise] or Bank of the Historian).
       * By visiting one of the many NPCs that give quests (ï¿½ la the &quot;NPCs in the City&quot;).
       * By using the Quest Tracker located in the bottom right corner of the mini-map (ï¿½ la [Find A Grave]).
       * By using the Quick Join system, which is located in the bottom left corner of the mini-map, players can be automatically entered into group chats.
       
       
             NEW QUEST HUB
      
       * A new quest hub has been added to the Stair of Destiny located in the eastern Barrens. You'll be able to queue for Warlords content by visiting the new quest hub.
       * A Warlords quest hub has been added to the Stair of Destiny located in the Eastern Plaguelands.
       * An Inn has been added to the Stair of Destiny for players that are still unable to gain access to the Stormwind or Orgrimmar via the instance portal.
       * All available dungeons and raids are now available via the &quot;D&quot; key. Please note that all dungeons and raids are not available via this channel; all such dungeons and raids will be re-opened with a live server one day after release.
       * Loot from the loading screens of Deadmines, Mistsong, and Terokkar Forest has been moved to the Loot Tab.
       * An &quot;Ammo Slot&quot; has been added to the top of the right-click menu. Ammo will no longer automatically reload into this slot. You can activate this slot by clicking the Ammo Slot icon next to the right side of the action bar.
       * Quest rewards in Alterac Valley for each faction now have a new, unique icon. Quest rewards from earlier Warlords content are still available via this tab.
       * Loot from the loading screens of all raid encounters now has an icon. Previously, only available from raid bosses were hidden in plain sight.
       * A new loading screen has been added to the loading screens of Tears of a Jedi Knight, Wretched Skiver, and The Missing Rogue quest.
       * An &quot;Ammo Slot&quot; has been added to the top
       
       
 Mark of Arthas, a rare quality invitation, has been added to existing Mark of Arthas instances.
DUNGEONS
NEW WORLD BOSSES

Now that Arthas and his men have breached the Dark Portal, the Lich King's forces have
turned the dangerous dungeon into a veritable war zone. With the help of the demon hunters of
Arathi Highlands, the Alliance and Horde have begun scouting the Kun-Lai
and have begun sending reinforcements.




CITIES AND FACTIONS
NEW HIGHEST DUNGEON RAIDING IN THE MACAU


Players who join the Highmant or Highmountain West factions to fight on behalf of Tauren or Horde
will receive a new raid structure: the Highmant, held by the Tauren and Horde.
This raid structure will allow players to form a powerful
monk bond with an NPC ally, and work together to overthrow the current
current ruler of Tauren or Horde. These raids will have weekly and daily bonuses and
tips, and are intended for a variety of raid composition.


The Highmant will be a hub of Tol Barad and Orgrimmar, the capital city of
the Alliance. The Highmountain West faction will extend the Reach and the Eastern Plaguelands
of the Horde in order to provide a foothold for the new raid structure.





RETRIBUTION DUNGEON: THE SHADOW OF THE RAID CONTINUES

The adventures of Prince Kael'thas and the Alliance's finest continue in the Shadow of the
Raids. Collect all the Emperor's finest gear and head to Darrow Downs to claim the
embarkation of your very own Kael'thas.

 * The Shadow is now open for play and the 25 player spawn rate has been
   reduced.
 * The Shadow now has a limited number of daily quests to complete.
 * Creatures in the Shadow now have a chance to drop an item called a Heart of Flame (item
   required for the epic mount quest &quot; [120] Heart of the Storm&quot;). This item can be obtained
   from the following creatures in the Shadow at least once: [Moonkin], 
   [Darkrai Cloth], [Thori'dal, Bludgeon of the Dark Lord], [Darkrai Gore], 
   [Thori'dal Leather], [Thori'dal Weight Belt], [Thori'dal Weight Belt], and 
   [Thori'dal Braid]. The Thori'dal Weight Belt and Darkrai Gore items are rare
   items found in Broken Shore.
 * The Shadow now has a limited number of daily quests to complete.
 * The Shadow now has a chance to drop an item called a [Frostweave Net]. This item can
   be obtained from: [Dalaran Net], [Frostweave Net], [Frostweb Net], [Frostweave
   Net Vest], [Frostweave Net Shoulder Pads], [Frostweave Net Around], [Frostweave

     When a player uses an ability that has a visual effect that resembles a cross-section of the torso, they are viewing a representation of the character's torso in 3D space. The player's head is displayed in left field, while the character's hands and feet are displayed in right field.
      
      
      In addition, players can now inspect other characters while viewing a character's torso in 3D space by clicking on the words &quot;Character Name&quot; at the top of the screen, selecting an image, and then dragging it onto the screen.
      
      GUILDS
      
      Guild creation is now in the game, but not quite as it was originally intended to be. Gone are the days when you could create a guild and call it whatever you wanted. You now required a 2-page application to be able to join a guild, and a 3-page application to be able to create a new guild. While we have made some improvements to the guild creation process, it is still not quite as simple as it was.
      
      
      In order to make the guild experience more meaningful, we've made some changes to the guild experience itself. In particular, we've added a third step to becoming a member of a guild, the &quot;Story Step.&quot; This third step allows a member of a guild to experience the full value of the experience bonus before deciding to join a guild, by providing a steady stream of bonus rewards for participating in a weekly bonus roll, and offers an incentive to continuing the guild regardless of whether you are a member of the guild or not.
      
      
       * Each week, players will receive a new quest at a random location on the world, requiring them to complete a specific dungeon run in order to receive the &quot;Story Reward&quot; â€“ a hefty 375% bonus to an item's drop rate!
       * The quest can be completed by all players who have attained a rating of Silver or higher in the respective role that week, but only a member of a guild will be eligible to receive the bonus.
       * Completed dungeons will award bonus resources up to a maximum of 375% of the week's cap, with a weekly cap of 10,000 (up from 10,000).
       * Once a player has earned more than one story reward from a specific week during the same period, the player will receive an additional bonus roll for that week's reward.
       * The final bonus roll reward will be based on the final rating of the guild that week, with a minimum cap of 1,000 for each guild.
       * Once a player has earned more than one bonus roll during the same period, the player will receive an additional bonus roll for that week's reward.
      
      FLIGHT PATHS
      
      Flight paths have been added to Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch, and Arathi Basin.
      
      
      Paths are no longer available on the fly from several locations along the Eastern Kingdoms to each of these flight points.
      
      
      Players will now be able to use flight paths that they have discovered along their travels.
      
      
       * Flight Paths 
          * Flight Paths have been added to Ironforge, Darnassus, Orgrimmar, and Thunder Bluff.
          * Flight Paths have been added to Stair of Destiny, Talonbranch, Shattrath, and The Undercity.
          * Flight Paths have been added to Orgrimmar, Stair of Destiny, and Theramore Isle.
          * Flight Paths have been added to Outland, Northrend, and Draenor.
          * Flight Paths have been added to Outland, Northrend, Draenor, and Battle for Azeroth.
          * Flight Paths have been added to Draenor and Eastern Kingdoms.

World Of Warcraft:  [Forsaken Wastes]

 [Terminus Oculatus]
Chalice Of Fire
Blizzenblitz 


A short time ago we introduced you to the concept of a &quot;turbo charge&quot;, whereby a player's powers and abilities temporarily increase in efficiency by applying a small amount of additional damage or healing to an already-existing effect on the target. Today we're introducing you to the concept of a &quot;turbo-honor charge&quot;, whereby when demonstrating mastery of a role, your auto-attack hits an additional nearby target for a large damage bonus.

Together, these two changes represent the first step toward what we hope to see in World of Warcraft: instant, automatic, customizable, peer-to-peer damage and healing. While we still have lots of work to do in order to fully realize this vision, we can at least say that it's a start.

EDITOR'S NOTE: This article discusses an ongoing topic within the World of Warcraft development team. We'd like to hear your thoughts on the subject. Please send suggestions to the forum administrator.

&quot;The old guard of the Horde is in mourning. Fearful of Malfurion's return, the titans of the Horde have taken to wearing black armor and carrying heavy black bags. As such, their faction is unrecognizable from the one that once comprised Stormwind.&quot;
       * For the titans, this is a fitting end. Malfurion had hoped that by uniting the Horde and Alliance, he could finally unite Azeroth once more. Unfortunately, his plans have gone awry. Angry at being left behind, the titans have taken to raiding Stormwind's Trade Spots to fill their bellies.
       * The titans have managed to secure a shipment of Beasts that could only be obtained through the course of bloody battles. Should this prove successful, the heroes of Azeroth may finally be able to challenge the titan rulers once more.
       * To ensure that the titans of Zandalararar haven't been forgotten about, all heroes will have their portraits displayed on the walls of their respective cities.

====================
This week marks the 10th anniversary of the Guild Awards. During that time, we've seen the awarding of Guild Awards become a formalized way to recognize outstanding guild achievements, and the Guild Awards themselves become objects of celebration instead of punishment.
       * Guild Awards are now presented in the form of Guild Challenges. Win or lose, you will receive a Guild Challenge for a random guild in Guild History.
       * Guild Challenges can be won via the guild experience bar or by simply accepting the announcement on Twitter that a guild has an award. Acceptance of Guild Challenges is not required, but it is recommended.
       * Win a Guild Challenge for an existing guild that hasnï¿½t seen enough awards ceremonies this year.
       * After winning a Guild Challenge, players have a chance to win an item that will allow entry to a randomly selected guild that has a similar theme to the guild they are challenging.
       * Announcements from past guilds supporting the guild challenging theme will be viewable on the guild leader board.
       * Successfully completing guild challenges and winning the guild challenge will earn credit for a new reputation category.
       * Once a guild has been granted credit for a particular theme, players can accept the guild challenge in any of the guild's chat channels (use /to accept for a guild challenge, /to lose for a guild challenge, /for all others) to gain access to that guild's chat channel.
       * Once accepted, players in that guild will be able to access the assigned guild chat channel (as seen here) through either their guild interface or the chat interface (coming soon to all major guilds).
       * Guild Leaders can invite a GM or a raid group for a given dungeon instance. A GM can be selected by the guild master or the guild leader based on the available roll call slot.
       * Upon accepting a guild challenge, players will be asked to fill out a Request for Raid or Warning Sheet. Both these sheets can be viewed in the guild leader support forum.
       * Once a player has accepted a guild challenge, they will be asked to fill out a Request for Player Help. This form allows the GM or the raid group to access the player directly while the player is out of the guild or out of the area (ex: /to request a player for raid group).
       * Once a player has submitted a raid or group for a given dungeon, they will receive an acknowledgement response email from the guild via the Guild Portal.
       * All requests for assistance are logged and tracked on the account, so players can access help from the account controls if they are experiencing any issues.
       * The account controls for a given realm are located on the same tab as the rest of the world, so players can access the account controls there as well.
       * The request log is now divided into sections for each type of request, allowing easier sorting of requests.
       * Players can now use the ï¿½Talk to a GMï¿½ function to submit a request and receive a response.
       * A link to the account controls page now provides a confirmation dialogue to allow players to select the account control that they would like to use.
       * A link to the account settings page now provides confirmation dialogue to allow players to modify the game client settings.
       * Players can now lock out additional features by clicking on the ï¿½Lock Outï¿½ button on the account screen.
       * Added a new option to toggle floating combat text on and off.
      

      
      NEW FEATURE: REST STATE CHANGES
      
       * Players now have an additional layer of protection against being attacked while

 
   
 * Pets
   *  [Avoidance] (passive): Now reduces damage taken by 5% while dodgeable, but no
   longer reduces the amount of damage taken while dodgeable.
   *  [Cower]: Now reduces the amount of damage taken while dodgeable by 20%, but
   is no longer affected by Mastery.
   * Cower: Now reduces damage taken while dodgeable by 30% and increases damage
    taken by 10% while dodgeable by 60%.
   *  [Cower]: Duration is now 8 seconds, but can no longer be used in
    trades.      
       
       
        

       
        *  [Blessing of Sanctuary], [Blessing of Kings], [Blessing of Sacrifice], and [Blessing of
   Protection] have been replaced with new spells: [Blessing of Kings], [Blessing
   of Sacrifice], [Blessing of Wisdom], [Blessing of Kings], [Blessing of Wisdom],
   and [Blessing of Sacrifice].
   
   HEALING UPDATES

Recently, receiving a healing aura from a Paladin's healing aura
will now heal you for the amount that you intended to receive it from the
heart.
   
   
   Champions of Light (Artifact trait)
       * There is now a new [Divine Prowl] PvP ability available to all
                                                
                     
     Stoneforge Quartermaster Azrael will now properly
   resurrect you with the Stoneforge Quartermaster's energy.     
          
          
                BLOOD CHANGES
      
      Blood type was the determining factor on the decisions Blizzard made in
        the course of their recent Resilience work. In order to properly
        balance the number of health and survivability of their damage
        mitigation, we've taken steps to remove that factor from the game. We
        will be making a Major Resolve patch to address this in a major way,
        reducing the number of points spent on Resilience by the same amount and
        merging it with baseline Resilience. As such, the Blood deathrattle we
        are making now has a smaller number of points to compensate for the
        removal of Resilience. The scaling and diminishing returns of those
        changes will continue to be the focus of the discussion of scaling and diminishing
        returns for different stats.
      
      
       * Blood deathrattlers now start with a healthy amount of health, but will burn more
         health per blood point (while in [Resilience]) upon death. This will
         be different for each class, specialization, and tree.
         

            / [Rapture] can now be cast anywhere in the world
             and is a global cooldown.

         
BUG FIXES

 * Fixed an issue that caused certain Macs to become stuck.
 * Fixed an issue that caused some players in the East Coast to become
 
 
 

      
      
      In order to make room for more Haste effects to apply to [Focused Will], a priest's haste has been modified by the Multistrike stat. For example, a priest who had a base Haste of 4% using a 4-point talent (instead of a 3% Haste increase from a 3-point talent) would now receive a 4% increase to their base Haste amount instead of 3% for using that talent.
      
      
       *  [Guarded by the Light] now increases Stamina by 45% (up from 35%), and the amount healed by [Flash Heal] by 45% (up from 30%), but no longer increases healing done by [Heal].
       *  [Stance of the Wounded] has been removed.
       *  [Leap of Faith]'s mana cost has been reduced by 80%.
       *  [Spirit Shell] is now a level-25 talent, replacing [Spiritual Healing].
      
      
      We've also made a few other changes to the talents that bless specific spells. In particular, we've changed the way [Focused Will], [Divine Providence], [Guardian Spirit], and [Holy Light] are applied to the periodic healing effect of [Renew].
      
      
      
      
      
      WE ARE NOW A GROUP OF TALENTED GROUPS WHO PREACHES THE LAW OF NATURE AND VALOR AS WELL AS PVP.
      
       * We're looking for a group of players who are tough as nails and also some who may just be able to shed a few too many tears.
       * We're a group of players who follow the adventures of Queen Azshara. As such, we're a bit of a collection of professions.
       * Queen Azshara herself is a player-created encounter that can be found in icy Craggy Paths in Ashenvale. As such, players can make use of her unique abilities and play to win the encounter.
       * The best part? (Item #7692) is an item that just so happens to be on the same plane as the Wracked item that spawned him!
      
      
    * Also worth noting is the fact that the items that spawn under the appropriate class banner (Classes #11, Pets #11, etc.) now all share a single tabard slot.
    * Also worth noting is the fact that many of the items on this new tabard are of the Fetid variety. Fetid in appearance, functionally speaking.
    * Also of note is the fact that each class can now craft up to 4 item of the Fetid variety (Classes #11, Pets #11, etc.).
    
    
          
      
    * New Level-60 Ability: [Ritual of Summoning]
       * Summons a random raid or world raid boss.
       * Cooldown is 1 minute, duration is 1 minute.
       * Maelstrom Weapon emote now has a visual that identifies it as an Enrage ability.
       * Ability has a 3-minute cooldown.
      
      
      
      
           MAGE
      
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For mages, we focused thinning out the niche and abilities that weren't used often. We made sure to retain abilities for mages to function in off-spec roles, since that flexibility is a defining characteristic of the class.
      
      
       *  [Arcane Barrage] has been removed.
       *  [Arcane Concentration]: The damage reduction afforded by this talent now exists, but is unavailable to the Warrior.
       *  [Arctic Winds] is no longer available to the Mage.
       *  [Remove Magic] is now available to the Priest.
       *  [Remove Curse] is now available to the Warlock.
       *  [Shatter] is no longer available to the Warlock.
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
             TALENT SYSTEM
      
      Like priests, mages have a talent system. Talents are now earned by completing quests. Focused on clearcasting, the talent system provides a mechanism for rewarding specialization in PvP.
      
      
       *  [Clergy Training] is now available to players who have completed the class quest [70] Seeking Arcane Power.
       *  [Focused Prayers] has been removed and replaced with a new talent, [Evangelism]. 
          * Focused Prayers reduces the cost of [Devouring Plague], [Frost Fever], [Pestilence], and [Choking Fog] by 50% for 6 seconds each time it is cast.
         
         
       *  [Frost Presence] has been removed and replaced with a new talent, [Glacial Spike]. 
          *  [Ice Barrier]: Replaces [Ice Block]. Does not stack with other effects that increase the Priest's Defense.
          *  [Inner Focus]: Instead of redirecting all mana with a single use, this talent now increases the effect of all Mana Shield spells by 10/20/30% for 6 seconds each time it is used.
         


       * A new quest has been added to complete for players on the Isle of Thunder.
       * Players who complete the quest &quot; [90] Thundering Point&quot; will receive a
         rare [Thundering Point Cap] item.




      ROGUE
      ABILITIES
      
      A number of abilities were added for rogues to aid in their adventivist pursuits. In addition to the new abilities provided by the Assassin class, rogues now also receive a bonus to secondary stat bonuses (Critical Strike, Mastery, etc.) when [Assassination] is used in Stealth.
      
      
      *  [Blind] is now a passive ability. The damage and slow effects of Blind will not be applied to the rogue if they are attacked while Blinded.

Honorable mentions
I know this is going to be a long post, and that it may take some time for everyone to fully absorb all of the above, especially since we're still a very young team, and not many of you have actually seen the game or really been in touch with the people behind the concept. So, here it is, and for those of you who are fortunate enough to be able to take the time to read through the full post, please bear with us: the Tides of Vengeance is a very small but growing team, and will be further expanded upon in future patches.
We'll continue to add to the depth of this out-of-the-box mechanic through the use of the new &quot;Honorable Kills&quot; feature, which gives players the opportunity to earn additional Honor upon earning a certain number of &quot;Honorable Kills&quot; from a given raid or dungeon boss.
Along the way, players will unlock new zones and dungeons, and will gain new titles, titles, and titles. To begin, we want to make it clear that this is not an official launch of Tides of Vengeance, and that there will be no additional changes for those new to the game who try to enter these new zones or dungeons.
The Tides of Vengeance Team
The Tides of Vengeance team is comprised of a full-time Dungeon Finder, an outside dungeon designer, and a dedicated dedicated Tides of Vengeance-related officer and officer's assistants.

   BATTLE FOR AZEROTH SEASON 2

-Between the events of the first and second season of Battle for Azeroth, the night elves have been attacked by an unknown, deadly force. The Warchief believes this attack was ordered by Wyrmrest Accord, and that the Nightfallen who perpetrated the attack is indeed the one responsible. The Warchief leads a strike team of twelve heroes, led by Warchief Kael'thas, on a daring escape from Orgrimmar. The Warchief and his men face an overwhelming number of Ogri'la, but they will soon run out of options. The Ogriâ€™la they face will be no match for the Warchiefâ€™s strength and determination. Players will now be able to lead a strike team in combat, starting at level 100. The Ogriâ€™la in the first season of Battle for Azeroth will be much tougher than they appear in the second.

-The second season of Battle for Azeroth will feature a new balance of druid talent trees. As part of this process, we have made several changes to druid talents.
    * The level cap has been increased to 100.
    * The Rejuvenation bar is now grayed out.
    * New Ability: Solarium Barrage (Level 100).
    * Casting a longer channeled spell (e.g. [Solaric Power]) will wake up your next sleeping target.
    * Healing targets over level 60 now receive twice the expected bonus to healing from [Healing Rain].
    *  [Feast of Souls] will no longer cancel upon taking damage.
    * Rage generated per melee swing reduced by 14%. This was to reduce the frequency of [Fatal Attractions] where this was not optimal.
    * Rage generated while sitting increased to 200% from 200%.
    * The [Gladiator's Slicer] auto-attack damage has been increased by 215%, but the reload time has been increased to 2.3 seconds (was 2.0 seconds).
    * Hunters will no longer miss with [Dismiss Pet] and [Dismiss] while using [Auto Shot].

The amount of newly allocated gold in the game should be fairly consistent between acts 6 and 11 of any given dungeon. However, in order to make even modest amounts of this new Conquest gear possible, we've raised its item level considerably. This means that players will generally see a larger selection of items in their inventories if they are geared toward Gold or Honorbound gear. In addition, existing items that upgrade in quality to higher-tier versions should be able to upgrade further, as we've done for other items in this series.
      
      
       * Any characters that completed the previous Acts of War for a random dungeon will receive a new title, &quot;Co-Founder of Hyjal,&quot; which will entitle them to a new mount.
       * Players that are not already on the Co-Founder of Hyjal will be able to obtain it by speaking with Archmage Timear in the Timeless Isle or by speaking with Vashj in Undercity.
       * The title of &quot;Co-Founder of Hyjal&quot; is automatically granted to players who are already on the Isle of Hyjal.
       * Level 90 players that are not already on the Isle of Hyjal can access the Timeless Isle by speaking with Archmage Timear in the Timeless Isle.
       * Under the Timeless Isle, players can access the Timeless Isle by speaking with Vashj in Undercity.
       * Vashj also has a variety of other functions, including:
          * Vashj the Falling: Teleports players to Vashj the Falling's side of the island.
          * Vashj the Living: Removes players from combat.
          * Arosyn the Tape: Sorts the dungeon pieces in reverse order of their appearance on the platform they're on.
         
         






      DUNGEONS
      
       * Players now receive an automatic &quot;Discover&quot; alert when an area of the dungeon they have already discovered is presented to them.
       * An area of the dungeon that is not revealed via the Discover system will now require a 2-hour exploration period prior to being available for the player to discover.
       * Unlike other Raid Finder dungeons, players do not automatically discover dungeons on their first attempt. As such, players may find themselves at a stalemate when attempting to queue for a given dungeon.
       * Dungeon Finder: Tabs for each wing now allow a player to navigate to a random tab for a given dungeon.
       * The Random tab allows a random group of players to queue together.

GENERAL

 * Bonus Armor: The amount of bonus armor you receive when you're tanking a boss has been increased by 33%.
 * Chances are, your luck has run out and you will not be receiving a full 300% bonus to attack power for your efforts. To compensate, you will receive a smaller and smaller amount of bonus armor.
 * Cooldown: The amount of cooldown you must wait before a boss kill has been increased by 50%.
 * Dispel Resist: This ability now has a 9 second duration.


 *  [Lights, Camera, Bacon]: These mounts now have their own unique sound when engaged in combat.


 * Dungeons and Raids
    * Failing to complete a keystone in time no longer causes a crash.
    * Battle of Dazar'alor
       * A number of character behavioral issues affecting players while transformed into the opposite faction have been fixed. These include fixes to Paladins' [Divine Steed] and Shadow Priests' language after exiting [Voidform].
       * Opulence
          * Fixed a bug that caused the coin shower visual to sometimes persist longer than intended.
         



WARCRAFT: THE MOVIE: THE GAME: THE MOVIE

 * In an effort to provide a more compelling reason to play the game, in WarCraft: The Movie: The Movie Player Characters Are Mangled, Players May Now Only Pick Up One Letter at a Time.
 * Due to the popularity of the &quot;I'm not a mob boss, I'm a hero!&quot; sentiment, portrait frames have been reworked and now feature a simplified version of the Human Illusion.

SO FASTENED!

We're pleased to announce that so-called &quot;fasteners&quot; will soon be fastened to virtually every item in the game, making it virtually impossible, if not impossible, to lose them all.


We've consulted with an engineer who â€œBlackoutâ€� anvils â€œcause he can.

PURCHASSE
FOR ALL RACES

Coming soon to a Nintendo eShop near you




ENGINEERING

 * The [Mechanical Dragonling]'s speed has been increased, and it can now be pulled off of Engineers.
 * Engineers can now learn the schematic for the [Overpowered] rifle.
 * The [Ignite Grenade] recipe now creates an [Infinite Grenade] when used, and also reduces the cooldown of [Explosive Trap] by 1/2/3 seconds.

   MOUNTS
   
   You can now earn up to four MOUNTS as vanity items. Four MOUNTS can be earned from a single victory point, and all four can be placed in a vanity slot directly after an existing vanity item. Three of the four new vanity items can be purchased from the Appearance Collection, and three of them can be purchased from the in-game auction house.



  TRADE SKILLS
   
   All Hunter pets have had one or more new trade skills that can be learned by mixing and matching pets from various hunter professions.
   
   BATTLE PETS
   
   Battle Pet Suits will now distinguish themselves visually from their non-combat pets when fighting other players.
   
   FIGHTS
   
   The system has been modified to allow for a greater variety of itemization for the Hunter and the Paladin. In addition, many non-combat pets have been changed to battle pets.


         SHADOW CHANGES
      
      Shadow priests had one large problem toward the end of Mists of Pandaria: single-target damage. Their AoE and multi-DoT damage was some of the best around, so they still ended up competitive on most fights. But, in any fight that was mostly single-target, they felt lacking. Additionally, one of the new stats we're adding in Warlords of Draenor, Multistrike, is almost exactly what their current Mastery, [Shadowy Recall], does for DoTs. So, we took these two problems and came up with a change that we think will solve both of them. The result is a new Mastery: Shadowy Recall, a new Mastery for Shadow Priests that primarily increases the single-target portion of their DoTs but also works well for multistrikes.
      
      
       *  [Silence] has been replaced with [Silence].
       *  [Silence] now costs 30 Energy in addition to its current effects.
       *  [Void Tendrils] now deal 15% less damage.
      
      
      Of course, in an ideal world, all three stats would go into zero when Void Tendrils or Void Ebbers are destroyed, leaving only 3 active stats. That's why we buffed both of these abilities, and why we removed the 3rd ability altogether. However, in practice, it's not that simple. Sometimes destroying a tank's primary target means that that target doesn't get affected by our defensive stats, and those that are not tanking generally do not benefit from that destruction. Therefore, we buffed them differently. This will allow more tanks to benefit from these stats, and still will, but will not defeat the point of destroying secondary targets.


       from Ulduar
    * Secret Flame Beds have been added to all Secret Flame Beds in the dungeon for players that have discovered the secret to sleeping dogs.

chaud2012-06-06, 05:24 PMBlizzard and Blizzard Entertainment today announced that World of Warcraft will be ported to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 computers in the next version of the game. This milestone was made possible thanks to the collaboration of several of the most important players in the MMO industry: Tom Chilton, Mike Morhaime, Jason Holt, and Michael Chu.




Lore
The new world-overlords were actually the original gods in a universe that we didn't consider canon when we made the game, and thus, didn't have enough information on them to establish. When we put in place the mythic raid, Mythic difficulty, to better reflect what some of the Mythic and the mythic expansion set are like, Mythic level has been changed to Mythic difficulty so that some players and the bosses more closely match up, and those Mythic players in the raid group could possibly learn the Raid Finder.
Mythic has been a different beast. It requires about 60 Mythic difficulty to obtain.


orcerous Intent
While the tooltip says there is no &quot;Sorcerous Intent&quot; trait, I can make an educated guess. Sorcerous Intent is a trait now only usable on creatures with an innate poison. It causes your poisons to be twice as lethal.

Sorcerous Intent is now only active on creatures below level 8.

There were no traps or traps that caused the tooltip to say that the tooltip is a trap. I know the trait's tooltip is not complete, so I have a feeling there will be lots of traps. As noted, this was a bug. We are working to make those traps a lot less buggy.



  


New Classes
Glyph of the Bloodthirst-Raging Blood of Sargeras  is no longer affected by the effect of Haste.
Glyph of the Bloodthirst-Raging Blood of Sargeras  is now affected by Haste.
Warmoth's Boon  will work now, so you can't take it before level 9. It was too powerful. This change was made to nerf Warmoth's Boon.
Warmoth's Boon  now works on your basic attacks, so you can make it useful in Arena.
Lor'theath's Blessing  will now also work on your basic attacks.
Glyph of the Storm's Prowess  is now only usable by druids. It is too powerful.
Glyph of the Storm's Prowess  now reduces the mana cost of your spells more or less for everyone.



Class changes that affect everyone
Curses that cause you to take more damage when you take a lot of damage now have a new name and an intended name:


Enrage, Frostbreath , Burning Wish and Drain Life
Restore Health now increases your health by 1% of your maximum health. This will make it a lot more palatable to take a few extra hits.

Glyph of Sargeras' Fury now causes you to take double damage for 6 seconds. In addition, whenever you take damage, you take half of the damage that is dealt to you!
Glyph of the Endless Hunger is now only usable by Druid after level 10. It has always done to make it more palatable. This change has been made to reduce its potential usage when a tank is trying to get some damage on you.
Glyph of Sargeras' Fiery Breath was too powerful and is more balanced now. We've slightly buffed its base damage so that it is easier to balance, but we can't make it better again.
Glyph of Sargeras' Fiery Breath is now only usable by Druid. We also want to make it an awesome way to cast Drain Life.
Glyph of the Bloodthirst-Raging Blood of Sargeras is now only affected by Haste and has no more uses. It now lasts 30 seconds or until refreshed by Bloodrage, which will only trigger it at level 10.
Glyph of the Endless Hunger is now only usable by Druid after level 10. This buff will make it easier to get damage.
Glyph of the Endless Hunger is now only usable by Hunter after level 10. This buff will make it easier to use Bloodrage.
Glyph of the Endless Hunger is now only applied to you by Bloodrage.
Glyph of the Endless Hunger is now only available to Hunter pets at level 10. It is better to leave it off for now.
Glyph of Sargeras' Fury now makes it more palatable to use a few more attacks.
Glyph of Sargeras' Fury is now only used by Hunter pets at level 10. Hunters already have a lot of attack power.
Glyph of Sargeras' Fiery Breath is now only usable by Hunter pets.
Glyph of Eternal Flames now only works on all damage dealt by pets, and has been added at level 10. If you keep your pets on full health, all damage from your pets will reduce the cooldown by 1 second.
Glyph of Eternal Flames now only works on all damage dealt by pets, and has been added at level 10. If you keep your pets on full health, all damage from your pets will reduce the cooldown by 1 second.




How to Play
How to play  is the first part of the tutorial video, and is all about how you and your companions can deal damage.



 

There are also a few small tips on what abilities you will see in game like &quot;Boulderfist&quot;, &quot;Blood Boil - Borrowed Rage&quot;, and &quot;Shadowfang&quot; you should also be playing them as much as possible.
 

I really hope that at least one of these notes would help a lot when you play through the new questline, I'm sure there are plenty of more.


 

The new questline is now complete with about 1 page of text on the front, and I would recommend playing through it for the first part of the questline aswell. I still have a lot of questions and I'll have a look at the quest notes and try and answer them too as much as possible. Source

Do you like playing warlock in a raid group, or have you played them before and are finding that the game takes so much time and effort to be able to do well, that it gets boring with every tier?
Not really. I enjoyed playing the new game. I did the original game because they had no options when I was playing new expansions and you only could play the one expansion that really wanted me to play it. I enjoyed it in the old game, and this will be my first time playing MMO-Champion anyway because I played both the original and the new expansion for a while. I think the game will still be fun. But no, I don't think the game will be boring so long as you can keep playing. And it is fun to play and I'm not sure I've noticed anything different other than the game is more fun to play now.

 Warrior Forums  / Skills  / Talent Calculator  / Artifact Calculator  / PvP Talent Calculator 
If it doesn't make you feel bad about doing things that are not as satisfying, why do you play?
I don't actually know if I'm getting this. I still enjoy warfaring and I like the thrill. There's really just no good reason. I'm not sure I'm getting this but in the early days of WoW development, warlocks were the only class with a big attack power cost. They wanted to buff, they didn't want it to be so much of your DPS that you could never kill with it. Source 



 fly out as the sky shifts, and even when the sun is not in alignment with the earth or sky, it still gives good visuals as it does so. All of this can be attributed to the use of an artist's studio in order to produce these visuals.

The skybox has a large amount of custom artwork and is updated regularly. This was not the case with The Fall. As with all things CreativeForge , it is possible that there will always be new art or visuals to add to the world, although the actual size of the skybox is usually the smallest possible size. The concept of the skybox, in the words of a post by Chris Robinson of Blizzard Entertainment  / Official Forums  it was simply too large. However, this is not an ideal solution and if we had to add more than one skybox, then the overall size would be large and then you would have to move the old ones to the side or away from them. This was obviously not an acceptable experience and we would have to come up with a solution to that and we ultimately chose to keep this technique as simple as possible, and leave it up to the artist to choose the best images they can for the job.

With that said, I would like to take a stab at it again. There are plenty of options to add skyboxes to the world to make the world feel alive as you will be able to zoom in and see the environment in your own home. However, one of the issues we have is that the skybox will not always be accurate, which is why you are not always able to see where you are or what's going on with your own home. This is something we have tried to resolve by adding a distance measurement for the distance between the skyboxes and also by using a simple animation system for the skybox to let you know where exactly you are. If you decide to move the skybox all the way to the end, then you will have to actually look up from where you are, look around to where you are, and go back and forth to adjust the distance, just like in any other mod. However, if you move all the way to the end and return to your home, then everything should work as intended: the world as a whole should be seeing the skybox and vice versa, or at least that is what we hoped to do.

Please don't hesitate to post feedback in comments or via PM where applicable, as I certainly can't promise it won't happen at the speed of light.

I don't want to jump to any conclusions on this but the skybox will not be fully implemented until around March, so I can't promise it will happen until then. Source 

Update: A new post about the original post has been added and the skybox should be completed sometime in April.

If it does still happen in April, the skybox will then be done for The Fall.

And the skybox won't be finished until May, before The Fall release in the US. If you have no idea where to start, just watch the trailer.

Update: The skybox should be finished sometime in the middle of May sometime, so let's go on with this again!

I think it is safe to assume that Blizzard has some work left to do to add more skyboxes for the future.

This is not the case for you as I would not buy a ticket to see this or anyone else, as it would definitely be a very expensive upgrade to you for now. The fact is that after getting a few things, you only have to wait for it to become part of real life for a while again.

If you ever wondered what has happened to Skybound? You are lucky!


Blue Posts
Class changes were meant to be very specific in which changes were coming, and that was the part of the reason they were implemented.


Classes

The idea of &quot;not specific&quot; is just that not every change will necessarily appear in the next patch.
So if a change was very specific from what I have seen in recent patches, I don't think that is what you should assume it means.
Also, if I am being entirely honest, we generally don't even want to be too specific about what changes are coming, since the community has probably reached some level of saturation where players don't care much about the details.

That's probably one of the reasons we kept things all in some sort of official codename, such as &quot;We all liked the way your class behaved at the end of the last patch anyway&quot;, or &quot;It's just a bug or something&quot;. 

Just as an aside, the old WoW forums and game forums were all pretty much exactly this kind of thing. The devs weren't really trying to solve every problem we had, but just as a community we came to the conclusion that you could have fun with the same classes, so we just had to be on it like a proverbial




UI Adjustments
Several UI adjustments are coming. These include making the ability to change the UI faster with more powerful tools, being able to move the map a good distance, and new tools for the UI: the mouse wheel will give players additional control over the UI, and the buttons for UI actions will be more visible.

We also want to address the situation where you could have a UI that isn't displaying correctly due to a bug or design issue. This will be addressed in a future patch.

The ability to move is a very important UI feature. Moving is not a bug and we'll work on adding a mouse click to move the map.

We don't see many UI problems with the mouse wheel anymore. If it's bugged, we'll fix it soon.

We want to address the issue of the map zoom having issues right now, which causes movement to be too slow when the map is zoomed out. We will add a fix soon, so that this will not affect you while zoomed out. In any case, the fix should not be a big deal and will help with the issue on it's own.

We want to fix these issues with the mouse wheel and the ability to change the map. This is only the first issue we want to address with the map.

We want to fix our issue with the ability to move the map if it's bugged.

Players may now log in at night by visiting the Adventure Journal window. This will now only appear after 8.0.2 is installed. If you've already reached level 91 with the new World of Warcraft client, you will not be able to see these changes. 

There should now be more clear warning for players to be careful with items dropped by the enemy.


How about when everyone has something with some kind of cool effect?
I'm not sure there's a huge opportunity to get everyone really excited about some kind of change unless you're really passionate about the idea.

We would probably have to spend a lot more time on it, so it probably would have to work hard, with a lot of development time to really figure out what it is people want. Source

User Interface

The Battle for Azeroth interface has changed to be more open and intuitive.
It should have a new interface layout for spells that are disabled by player movement.
The combat script should no longer go off during casting combat, and the Combat Log will give a warning when it does.
The Action Bar should no longer be lost on moving while the spell target is active.
The action bar should not display as though you are dying, dying, dying, dying, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage.



Nether Tempest is the one talent you need to get started with. It's not a core talent, but it's a good one.

Let's start with a little background.

What is Nether Tempest?
It's a new talent available in Cataclysm, it's available to all characters on your account, and it's a proc.

What does it do?
It's a new talent that increases the critical strike chance of Nether Tempest by 15% for 10 seconds. This is increased to 50% for 10 seconds after Nether Tempest has been cast.

When does it proc?
The proc rate depends on whether the target is in a Nether Tempest, in a Nether Tempest, or in a Nether Tempest.

How does it work?
The effect is triggered when the target has Nether Tempest on them. It's a global effect. You can't have Nether Tempest on yourself.

What is the benefit of having Nether Tempest on a target?
It's a good idea to have Nether Tempest on a target, especially when you have a Nether Tempest on a friend. It's not a good idea to have Nether Tempest on your friend's character.

What do you mean by that?
It's a global effect, it's a proc, it's a global, it's a global. You can't have Nether Tempest on yourself.

I'm not trying to be rude, but I'll just say this, Nether Tempest is a nice little buff to help you survive a boss fight.

What is the problem with having Nether Tempest on a target?
You can't have Nether Tempest on your own character, or you won't be able to use Nether Tempest.

Why not have it on your own character?
It's a nice little buff to help you survive a boss fight. It's not a good idea to have Nether Tempest on your own character.

It's a nice little buff to help you survive a boss fight. It's not a good idea to have Nether Tempest on your own character.

We can't have Nether Tempest on your own character because that's not cool enough.
We've never said that Nether Tempest is cool enough. We think we have enough of a reason to have it on our own character.

What's the benefit of having Nether Tempest on a target?






game&quot; to change the order of these effects; when you first select the first one, it changes the sequence of what's happening first and everything that follows has a longer-term effect on you, but the sequence in which it changes is random.
In terms of what goes into the new &quot;Battle.net&quot; button, we've already shown off some of the effects. It will change the order of abilities you select in a battle, it will change the order of the abilities and actions that go towards that goal. It'll also change your target. It's a really important tool for us as designers, it's a really important tool for us as programmers, and we want those things to be truly exciting for you. It has to be fun. It has to be entertaining for you. If it didn't, then it shouldn't exist.
I think the reason why it's important for designers, the reason why it's important for programmers, isn't just to be fun to work on. It's also so that people will know where the mechanics are coming from because we want them to have a way to know where the mechanics are coming from.
When you're making something that's a whole game in the context of the Battle.net feature, sometimes we need to have something to reset. We need to get to a point where, when you first launch the game and it launches on the Battle.net system, you have the choice of doing some cool stuff on the first few screens, you can see the Battle.net menu and it's this thing like the &quot;battle log&quot; option, you can do your Battle.net stuff, but after that the Battle.net system shuts down, you have to log out, you can play a match, and then we get it in the next phase where we can create the Battle.net experience, where we can change the character and the objective that you have and start the fight, and that's when it can be really fun to make those changes. That's when it's really exciting to work on what goes into the Battle.net button.
As a designer, we want characters to be fun, in particular with the new abilities, you shouldn't have to put too much time into it. I think that goes beyond just that, that goes beyond the &quot;let's make a character who is so awesome that they should have to do a lot of cool abilities&quot; because there are other ways to make characters that get you that feel cool, and we just want to make sure it's fun. That's one thing I love about the game is it has lots of things to do with the world and the world has lots of places, it has lots of abilities, it has lots of locations to explore and there is lots of interesting lore and stuff. For example, I'm a big fan of the idea that the Battle.net screen has a way to let you unlock quests and abilities, you can tell people, &quot;Oh, I got your ability. This guy is gonna be really cool and let me unlock it for you.&quot; No, it's like, that's a feature you can put to your character and then unlock it, I can, you can tell him, &quot;Let me play now. I got an ability that's good for now and it's gonna help me save my wife from this dude,&quot; but we want to let you know what that ability is, we want to see how it works, if it's fun, if it's fun. We don't want to say, &quot;You'll have to wait a day or four days for this. That's not a cool ability.&quot;
When the Battle.net system shuts down, we have to get to the new abilities from that screen, we have to find a way to do all of that cool stuff we want to do without it having to take forever. For this particular fight, we have the option to go into the Battle.net menu and you can get those abilities for your current hero. You don't have to wait that long, you don't have to spend the time. When people do buy into that, we are able to create a new hero, a new class. We are able to do things with that, like we got to make the warrior a bit more stealthy and this warrior a bit more stealthy. We're able to turn, I've got a skill, like I used to fight the troll, I had some heal, I had some attack, and I'm a warrior, and if you don't take one of the passive things you can do, we create a new Warrior. We make the troll move much more quickly. We take our attack away. We don't put the attack down immediately. We wait for the moment when things are finally happening and then we do it. We start attacking, we take out the troll if necessary. We get the fight started, we get the game started, we start making money, we get the game started, and we start making money at the same time.
That


Q. Will there be another level of rewards to earn in order to achieve the goals above?
A. Most likely, yes. The goal will be to earn both an Honor rating as well as a Bronze medal. We want players to feel amazing about the achievement and it's not going to feel like we're giving them a reason to do more content.

Q. How many new PvP zones can you tell us of?
A. There are currently 12 PvE zones in the game.

Q. You've said before that &quot;We don't think we've done anything wrong in the past.&quot; How is the game designed to allow players to customize their own experience?
A. We don't have a large amount of story in the game, and our story always begins and end within the MMO.


So, before everything happens in this episode, here's what your Alliance is looking for in this upcoming fight:
Your Alliance is asking for something from us.
An Alliance Hero.
You are a member of the Alliance.
You will need a Hero's Circle to do it.
You will need a Hero of the Black Temple to carry out the mission for you.
You will need Hero of Azshara to assist you in this fight.
You have reached this point of combat with a Hero you have never fought before. You are ready to stand up against the other members of the Circle.
You have been killed and there is no one else there to save you.

Q. Itâ€™s said that the PvP in World of Warcraft is just a way to provide some fun for people who enjoy PvP. For many players, it seems as though the gameplay is more rewarding when PvP is fun: It gives players a chance to kill and loot others to achieve victory. Is there any truth to that? What makes this PvP different


Here are a few more examples of new hotkeys and improvements to existing keys. The list of new hotkeys in the previous screenshot are just the latest ones we found, you might also see the same hotkeys under different names on a new character you're playing or a different color to the previous ones:

+ /cancel/cancel - Cancel a quest and immediately quit the current quest. Useful for PvP.
+ /moveTarget/MoveTarget - Move a target target with a particular spec, or any spec with a specific type of target in the UI.
+ /target - Move a target target.




New hotkeys
The list below shows some of the new keys that will be added this game release:

+ /focusFire - Focus a fire elemental.










Patch 5.4 Dungeons
You're not going to like the new dungeons because most items you will get from them are useless. You are going to have to rely on dungeons for gold because most raids have a lot of gold. 
To help with that, WoWZone has a few things that help. The 

1 You can find all of the old quests in your favorite WotLK zone. 

2  There are a lot of random people that visit dungeons, but most of them don't bother with the quest. 

3 You can also find all of the quests on the PTR. 

4 Finally, some of them will reward you with gold. 

5  I believe you will come across the new 5 man normal difficulty dungeons. 





Gnome Tweets
If gnomes were introduced in the old days and never played WoW, the result would be the troll. Celestalon 

[...] It is not necessary to have a good player game with a good server. You are doing a more valuable job at the same time. Celestalon 
[...] I find it more important than ever for me to manage my own game. I would also strongly suggest that you are responsible for your own game and not the other way. Celestalon 

The old days were all about the raid team!
We don't make MMOs to make your life easier, our game was designed by people. You could take the time to read the original beta notes to see what the changes were, but you probably wouldn't be in a lot of trouble. Celestalon 

Lore
I still like the lore, but the real question is, why not go back and add more lore into the game?
It's not really a good use of my time. It would help immensely. And yeah, most of us like lore when we read it. Celestalon 

Can you explain why you want to keep Lore &quot;borrowed&quot; so much?
&quot;We love it,&quot; I said &quot;Because players love a little bit of lore that has been brought up in the past.&quot; That seems pretty reasonable to me, is it not an issue that it does not carry itself, or will it? Celestalon 

Why would you want to keep Lore? Why not just make more lore out of it?
It is one of the main reasons I have gotten into WoW. I play like a troll. I like to be a little mischievous. Celestalon 

I really liked the Lore in Cataclysm, but now I hate the feeling of nostalgia.
The main reason I still play WoW is it has been a great experience but is the same reason I love my roleplaying games, I do the same thing from time to time, when I feel they are appropriate. 

Will you return to the lore from the old days, or be more explicit in how you want to play the lore?
Both.

to me like a bunch of kids on Halloween, with nothing but a bottle of pumpkin spice, like &quot;I have to keep my powers.&quot; I canâ€™t imagine them doing the opposite, though I do wish they never made these things. We just donâ€™t want to see them used for anything else besides to create some kind of Halloween costume.
All right, good point! I am just saying that the ability for me to be in the party of the night is a big thing in my mind.

How would you describe the playerbase? What do you think the community wants to see? Is this a problem in the design?
I have been playing WoW since 2004 and I have no idea what you have seen yet, so I would say that the community is kind of a blank slate.

I have been a professional game designer and I can tell you that I have never been in a group that had all the abilities they are currently seeing offered. The &quot;game design&quot; is often a joke, and players have a certain amount of empathy toward it, but rarely do they actually test it out. These are usually the players that do not play an MMORPG, and they do not actually play the game they play.

How much can you give us a good idea of what people want today? How much of the game is you?
I can say in my opinion the community values the game at a level they are likely to accept more and more, even though it is a new thing. This is my impression, and I know it is a fair opinion, but we also know a lot of others have to agree as well.

How do you see the world of games as you see it today?
I think we will see more and more players who want more, just like we see more and more people who want fewer and fewer things than now. That isn't an unreasonable expectation by any stretch.

What do you think should be removed from MMO design? I understand where we are coming from when we say &quot;it's a good idea to be more about this or that&quot; but I think that is only a symptom of that issue. You can always come back and say &quot;This is a good idea, why not a new feature&quot;. I think it can't be that easy to come up with a new or even a better game.

I think it was good that Blizzard's approach was to not remove the old MMO from the market. If you don't like it, we don't get that, but if you are the only one who does and are still coming here , we don't get that either. I think the community is more likely to have a good view of the game instead of looking for the next best thing.
If we have too many changes to consider and a new player is going to be in, we have too many changes to consider.

What else is working in your opinion as a fan.
I think the current design is not working well right now. It's frustrating when it feels like the player isnâ€™t going to be a player at all. You might see the game as a new and relatively unfamiliar player, which is a great design, and the most compelling reason we make MMOs, right?

If you want to talk about changing mechanics, they might be one of the best things in the game to do. You can make the player feel like what they are doing is interesting, but there should only be very good reasons to do something that isnâ€™t a new feature. We have a long tradition of making new features and changing them based on player feedback. This is why we don't want to see a game where players can either take the experience and get to know the mechanics or just say to the devs to just ignore them, but itâ€™s okay. Some ideas are always better and some ideas are always just more fun.

You do agree that players arenâ€™t going to keep coming back to old games to play?
I'm not sure if they want to. The old MMO may not work for you, but maybe they are tired of it and are willing to give in. If this happens you should consider whether there is a better new MMO out there somewhere else. That is often the message I hear, so itâ€™s a good idea to have some kind of community feedback.

What is your view on the state of World of Warcraft and MMO Design? Do you think that some of the features and concepts are not that great and that MMO design isnâ€™t getting to a point where the players are able to enjoy it?
I think MMO Design is getting so far off track. I don't think it's fair to say MMO Design has become less. I don't want to hear you saying that MMO Design doesnâ€™t work, but if you say that it doesnâ€™t work and that new ideas are bad ideas, you are simply not thinking.




Mage Tower Upgrade
Some mage towers are getting improved stats!

Blizzard released the changes in the changelog
The Mage Tower has received an upgrade from -30% health up to -50%.



You guys have pretty much always had a &quot;skill is hard&quot; mantra. Are there ever more than 2 professions which are difficult to have/have?
Actually yes. I mean, it used to be &quot;I can only get on one beast&quot; and &quot;I cant get on two mounts&quot; but it just got to be very obvious as the 2nd specialization. It's kinda a double-edged sword. I really don't think we've found a perfect balance yet. I don't say that it's one of those rare cases but we do think it might be the case.



Q. Are you aware that players want to be able to do things other than be solo players or guilds for longer hours? If so, what have you done to provide these more options? How do you feel about this feature being more available?
A. This one is easy -- we have added multiple options for players to choose to be more or less on their own and not have to depend on the system as a whole for the duration of their raid. On a personal note, the fact that an encounter you can do for up to 3 days that everyone wants to do, is much more enjoyable, than say a raid where you can only do that to 30% is a huge improvement.

Q. What does your team think about the addition of the new raid options? Are they helpful for new player experience or at least for raiders who have never done dungeons before?
A. This is our hope -- as with all the new content that the team has been working on, we hope to let players have a great time doing what they want without the fear or the expectation that you will be able to do things that other players will get bored of and won't be able to.

Q. Some of your fans still have the need to complete content faster and faster. You've taken a strong stance against speedruns as well. How do you think speedruns have impacted the experience of the game?
A. Speedruns have always made the experience of the game and so it's good for many players as well, though it does make for a very bad experience for those who like slow, quick, or quick wins. We think some of the current design space would benefit from being able to offer a different type of experience, but there would have to be additional systems for achieving the same ends.

Q. Players like the idea of having to do something new while leveling. Do you plan to make new content faster for them and not provide old content faster?
A. While no one likes new content, we do want players to have a lot of the time of doing an old content to come back. To that end however, we also do want the new content to be in the same place as the old content.



 want to offer the players what they want with what they do. If there were more quests, and maybe they would be a lot more fun, that's cool. But for now the focus is on making sure that you want to have fun while leveling up. As you get stronger and more gear, it gets easier to get more rewards.

All of this is to say that leveling isn't meant to be boring, and it isn't meant for every person who runs into the dungeon. The intent is for you to make fun choices as you try to get all of your stats. As you get stronger, some of the rewards become easier to obtain. When you get to a better state for your talent points, more and more choice is being made in which talent points you get. 

Now, as some players get higher and higher to go, more choices must be made to reach their maximum potential. When I say max possible, I am not talking about a point where someone reaches max level in all of the classes that they want to, but even there you will go over and over in different ways. You won't be 100% sure of which talent points or stat modifiers that you get per level, but that's a lot of things that you can choose from. I think for now, players are really excited for the new content, particularly since it is more epic, and of course you'll be going for several levels after that if you are really good at those things. But, the new dungeon mechanics are new and fun and don't currently have any clear cut requirements to them other than to get the most experience possible by playing every way possible.

Now that is all we have for now. We'll keep you posted on everything we have planned, so feel free to let us know what suggestions you might have in the comments. Thank you!

The Heart of Fear is a new world of fear and dread that is almost entirely open to the players of the Warcraft universe.

The Heart of Fear is a vast, beautiful world of magic and wonder, where the Burning Legionâ€™s savagery has long been a source of great peril and untold horrors. Here, the Old Gods have long been at war with the demons, and the festering wounds of the Burning Legionâ€™s war with the demon lords have only deepened the threat they pose.

The Heart of Fearâ€™s inhabitants are haunted by the terrible events that transpired in the mortal world during the Second War. But fear is a powerful ally of the Old Gods, and the threat they pose to the world is immense. The Heart of Fear is at the heart of the Old Godsâ€™ conflict, and a battle between the Old Gods and the forces of the Burning Legion has raged for millennia.





&quot;It's been a great success, and we have to say thanks to everyone for that,&quot; said Alex Pavlina, Senior Producer for Hearthstone. &quot;The team has been working on a lot of different projects and we have the privilege of working with some incredible players. We have a great new game coming to the Wii Uâ„¢, and weâ€™re excited to announce that weâ€™re working on a new Hearthstone game for the next-generation console, the next-generation Xboxâ„¢. This game will be a collaboration between Blizzard and Activision, and weâ€™re excited to be bringing it to the Wii U, which will allow us to bring Hearthstone to more people around the world.&quot;

Hearthstone is a card that is not on the PTR yet. 

I'm not sure how to explain it at this point, but I will try to explain it in a couple of ways.

First, the Hearthstone card design is a very collaborative one. I do not think that the original cards had any great intention of being fun or exciting. They were designed to be fun and exciting, not to be fun and exciting. The game is about a group of heroes, not about a single player, but there is always a chance that some of the cards will become more about the fun of the group rather than the fun of the group itself. We have a lot of cards that are fun and exciting, and some that are fun and challenging, but they all share the same rules. That is how the game works.

I think it was one of the biggest things that made Hearthstone feel like a real game. It has a lot of cards that are fun and exciting, and some that are fun and challenging, but they all share the same rules. That is how the game works.

I think that Hearthstone has always had a strong sense of place for a lot of players, but I think that the Hearthstone team has been able to bring that to the game. I think it is something that everyone should try and take part in at some point. 

I think the key to Hearthstone is that the game is built around the idea of a shared goal, and the world is a big place. We are in a very big fantasy world, and we are trying to make sure that it feels more epic than ever. We are trying to make sure that we are making sure that we are giving players as much freedom as possible to engage in the story and not just the action. We are trying to make sure that we are giving players a wide array of abilities and spells, and we are trying to make sure that we are giving players a lot of freedom in how they can customize their character and build their character. 

The game is a really good opportunity for players to have their own individual stories that they can play out.

The fact that the game is a cooperative game is something that is really appealing to us. I think that players will always find a reason to play when they play the game. We have always tried to make sure that the game is accessible, but we have also always tried to make sure that it is not as hard as other games. 

I think that we have always tried to give players a variety of ways to customize their character. We have tried to make sure that we have some really unique abilities and spells that are only used when you are really fighting the enemy. We have tried to make sure that we have some really unique spells that have a chance to be used by a lot of different classes. I think that there is a lot of overlap between classes, and it makes it feel like you are in a world that is a little bit more unique and different than the other games that have come before. I think that we have always been interested in the idea that the game can be a little bit more about the world, and not just the heroes. 

I think that the game is a lot more about the world and not just the heroes. I think that this is one of the things that is really exciting about Hearthstone. I think that we have always had a strong sense of place for a lot of players, but I think that the Hearthstone team has been able to bring that to the game.

I think that I agree with the argument that we have always tried to make that there is always a chance that some of the spells that we have made are going to be overpowered.

The battle is now officially over. The tournament has begun, and the battle for the world championship is about to begin.

The battle for the world championship is underway.

The Battle for the World Championship
The Battle for the World Championship is a double elimination bracket, where the top 8 teams from the North America region will be seeded into a single elimination bracket. After that, teams will be placed in a single elimination bracket, and then the tournament will be played out to the best of 7.5.




In the wake of the terrible events of the War of the Three Hammers, the three factions have declared war on the world. The battle for Azeroth is coming to a head!

The Horde and the Alliance, with the assistance of the Horde's powerful hero, Arthas Menethil, have begun a series of quests to gather resources to help rebuild the ruined world. As these quests progress, they will unlock additional powers to aid their cause, and the quests will become more and more difficult.

Arthas will also help the Horde and the Alliance with their quests, as well as provide new powers to aid them in their cause.

Each time the Horde and the Alliance complete a quest, the quest will become more challenging and you will need to work together to complete it. When it is complete, Arthas will reward you with a piece of loot.

Alliances will also be able to unlock additional abilities for their hero through additional quests.






From time to time, weâ€™ll announce a number of things related to World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade. Weâ€™re excited to announce that weâ€™re working on a new expansion for World of Warcraft, The Burning Crusade: Rise of Azshara. Weâ€™re also excited to announce that weâ€™re working on a new expansion for StarCraftÂ®: Legacy of the Voidâ„¢.

Weâ€™re also happy to announce that weâ€™re also working on a new expansion for Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, which weâ€™re calling Hearthstone: The Burning Crusade.

In addition, weâ€™re also excited to announce that weâ€™re working on a new expansion for World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade: Rise of Azshara. The Burning Crusade will take place in the ruined world of Azeroth after the events of the Cataclysm. The Burning Legion is a demonic force that has arisen in the world of Azeroth, and itâ€™s up to the heroes to stop it. The heroes have been battling the forces of the Burning Legion since the beginning of the war between the Horde and the Alliance, but the conflict is far from over.

The Burning Legionâ€™s assault on Azeroth has set in motion a chain of events that will lead to the end of the world, and the arrival of the Burning Legion. This new expansion will be a brand-new story with an epic conclusion. The story begins with the events of the Battle of Dazarâ€™alor, when the armies of both the Horde and the Alliance must take the fight to the heart of the Burning Legionâ€™s power. As the heroes of both sides prepare for their ultimate battle, they will encounter the Legionâ€™s most powerful champions, the Burning Legionâ€™s greatest champions, and the mysterious and powerful draenei who stand in their way.

A new chapter opens in the Warcraft universe when the heroes of the Horde and the Alliance face the Burning Legionâ€™s greatest champions, who have all fled to the worldâ€™s inner sanctums to face the Legionâ€™s might. With the help of the draenei, the heroes of the Horde and the Alliance will be able to face the forces of the Legionâ€™s war effort.

The story of the Burning Crusade begins with the events of the Battle of Dazarâ€™alor. The battle between the Horde and the Alliance has erupted into a full-scale conflict that threatens the very existence of Azeroth. The orcs, orcs, and their blood elf allies have held the planet for nearly a thousand years, and now it is up to the heroes to stop the Burning Legionâ€™s reign of terror.

The heroes of the Horde and the Alliance have begun a campaign to reclaim Azerothâ€™s once-forgotten treasures, but the ancient enemy of Azeroth is far from defeated. The forces of the heroes must now face the forces of the Burning Legion, who have been at the forefront of the assault against the world. In the face of the demonic forces that have begun to threaten the world, the heroes must once again face their greatest foes.

The heroes will face a series of new challenges as they try to reclaim Azerothâ€™s treasures, including the location of the first of the great two-pronged axe, which is located within the depths of the depths of the world, and the location of the second of the great two-pronged axe, which lies at the center of the world.

&quot;We're not just going to say, 'Okay, you're done. We don't need you anymore.' &quot;

I'm talking about how the MMO community has changed over the years and how it is today. I think it's safe to say that, in the last 10 years, the MMO community has become a much more dynamic place. The internet has changed the way people interact with each other. And, as a result, it has changed the way that people think and play.

I think that's the biggest thing that's changed about the MMO community: the amount of opinion that we have, and the amount of free time we have to devote to it. We have a lot of opinions. We have a lot of rules, and we have a lot of social norms that we have to abide by. The internet has been a very powerful force for the MMO community, and that has changed the way we interact with each other.

It's important to understand that, from our perspective, it's still a great place to get new experiences, but we don't think it's a place that we want to be. We want to create something that we feel will be a better experience for players, but at the same time, we want to make sure that it's not the place that every player is going to play. If you feel that the MMO community has not been doing its job, we will try to make sure that you know that we have plans to make sure that the game experience for you is better.

I'm not saying that the community has always been the most active and creative. We've all been there, and we know that we're not always the best at what we do. It's important to understand that we're all human beings, and we make mistakes. We make mistakes, and we'll make more mistakes in the future. But we also make the best decisions we can make for the best interests of the game, and we're not going to let that happen by just reacting to the feelings of people who disagree with us.

We're going to try to make sure that there's an honest discussion about the direction of the game and about the direction of the game and the direction of the community, and that we take those conversations into account. I think it's a very important part of that.

For example, I think that it's important to recognize that the MMO community is not just a place where you post about your own experiences with a game. It's a place where you interact with other players, and it's a place where you make your own contributions to the game. I think it's a place where you can make your own contributions to the game, and it's a place where you can make your own decisions about what you want to see in the game.

If you think back to when I first started working on a game, I was a guy who played almost every MMO and every game, and I spent most of my time playing games. I loved the community, and I loved the freedom of being able to make my own decisions about what I wanted to do with my life. I also loved the fact that I could make my own decisions about what I wanted to see in the game. I also loved the freedom of being able to make my own choices about what I wanted to see in the game. I think that's the main reason why I never stopped playing games, and I always wanted to be a part of the community. But I never had the opportunity to be a part of the community. I never had the chance to play in the game. I never had the chance to make my own decisions. I never had the opportunity to make my own decisions. I never had the chance to do something for the community. I never had the opportunity to show my true colors. I never had the opportunity to make my own decisions about what I wanted to see in the game. I never had the opportunity to show my true colors. I never had the chance to make the game better. I never had the chance to do anything for the community.

Now that I have a new job, and I'm also a cofounder of a company, I have a lot of freedom. I have more freedom than ever before, and I have the freedom to make the game better. I can make the game better. I can make it better and better and better and better. I can make it better and better and better. I can make it better and better and better and better. I can make it better and better and better and better. I can make it better and better and better. I can make it better and better and better. I can make it better and better and better and better. I can make it better and better and better. I can make it better and better and better. I can make it better and better and better. I can make it better and better and better.





But, that's the point. I'm not trying to tell you what you should or shouldn't do with your life. I'm just saying that I think it's important to note that the best thing you can do is try to be happy and be creative. I've found that's what I'm most passionate about, and that's what I'm most excited about.

I think I'm going to try to be a bit more honest with you guys. I don't think I'm ever going to be able to be a professional musician. I'm not going to be able to play guitar or drums or anything. I'm not going to be able to play a keyboard or anything. I'm going to have to learn to play the piano or something. I'm going to have to learn to write songs. I'm going to have to learn to play the drums or the guitar or whatever. I'm not going to be able to do all of those things.

I'm going to be an artist. I'm going to make art. I'm going to make art for the sake of making art. I'm going to make art for the sake of making art.

I'm going to make art for the sake of making art. I don't care about having to compromise to make it work. I don't care about the music. I don't care about the art. I care about the music. I care about the art. I think that's the beauty of the art world in general. It's not about creating something and then making it work. It's about creating something that you enjoy, and then playing it to your friends.

I think that's what I think the problem with the game is with the music, with the game, with the game design. I think it's easy for the music to be too easy. I think there's too much of that. I think the music can be too easy. I think there's too much of that in games. I think the game can be too easy too. I think that's part of it. I think you should make the game easier. I think you should make the game harder. I think the games should be more about making choices. I think you should be able to make the game more difficult, but I don't think that's easy. I think the game should be more about finding fun and fun in the game. I think it's just a matter of time until the game gets really difficult.

I think we're at a point now where the game design is too easy and the music is too easy. I think the game design is too easy and the music is too easy. I think it's a little bit of a pain to make games because we have to make the game harder. I think there is a little bit of that in games now. I think there's a little bit of that in the music. I think it's easy to get too much into the game and to make it too easy. I think we've gone too far with the music. I think we've gone too far with the music. I think it's too easy for the music to be too easy. I think there is a little bit of that in the games. I think the game is too easy to make. I think it's too easy for the game to be too easy. I think the game is too easy to make fun. I think the game is too easy to make fun. I think the game is too easy to make fun. I think the game is too easy to make fun. I think the game is too easy to make fun. I think it's too easy to make fun. I think the game is too easy to make fun. I think it's too easy to make fun. I think it's too easy to make fun.

In the next build, we're going to be making some improvements to the summoner spells.

Sending a summon to a location

First, we're going to be making it so that you can send your summon to a location. This will allow you to summon a random NPC.

It's not yet clear if the range on this will be 5 yards or 10 yards, or if you'll be able to send your summon to a 10 yard range.

The duration of this ability is determined by your mount. If you have a flying mount, you'll be able to cast this on the ground. The cooldown is also fixed at 10 seconds.

The target of the spell will be in the location you specified.

You'll need to be able to see the target in order to cast this. If you can't see the target, you'll need to be able to see the spell in the spellbook.

It's possible that you'll also need to be able to target the target with the spells you've been using since the last time your summon was summoned.

The target of the spell will also be able to use the spell, but it won't be possible to target a mob that is currently in the area.

The summon will be able to be targeted again if you move the mount away from the target.

This spell will only work in Cataclysm.






The Daily Blink  reports that a new &quot;secret&quot; to the upcoming World of Warcraft: Cataclysm expansion is coming soon.

It's a mystery...

Why is the world changing?
There are two answers: The world will change, and the world will change faster.

The world will change, because the human race has been fighting for centuries to save the world.
The world will change, because a new threat has risen to threaten the world.

The world will change because the Horde and the Alliance have begun to make progress toward a new peace that will culminate in a new era of peace, prosperity, and friendship.

Why?
The Horde and the Alliance have been at each other's throats for centuries. Now the tide has finally turned and the Horde and the Alliance have begun to build a new alliance to fight the Horde and the Alliance's war machine.

This alliance is called the Horde and the Alliance, and it will be a struggle between the Horde and the Alliance to reclaim the world from the Burning Legion.

The war between the Horde and the Alliance is already well-known, but the war will be even more intense once the orcs have been defeated by the heroes of the Horde and the Alliance. The war will rage for centuries, and the world will change forever.

Why?
The orcs have always been a fierce, savage, and dangerous species, and they have always been at each others' throats. But the orcs are also extraordinarily resourceful, and they have learned a great deal about how to survive and thrive in the face of the harsh world.

The orcs are also extremely cunning and adaptable. They are also remarkably well-equipped with a variety of weapons and armor, and the orcs have been known to use them to great effect in warfare.

Why?
The orcs are also incredibly resilient, and their bodies are remarkably strong. The orcs are also incredibly resilient, and they are even capable of sustaining tremendous damage for years without requiring any help from their allies.

Why?
The orcs are also incredibly strong-willed and powerful, and their determination and drive to succeed are legendary.

Why?
The orcs are also extremely adaptable, and they have been known to use their cunning and resourcefulness to great effect in warfare.

Why?
The orcs have a history of taking great risks, and the orcs have a history of experimenting with magic. The orcs have also been known to use magic to great effect, and they are highly skilled at controlling the magical energies that flow through their blood.

But you're not going to be able to change it.

We're not going to give you the ability to change your class until you've spent a lot of time leveling. It's not a great experience to suddenly find yourself on the wrong tier for the next tier, which is why we're going to be putting it in a different way. We're also going to be removing the requirement that you have at least one level-10 character to queue for the new class.

We don't want you to feel obligated to use the new class. We want you to feel like you're getting the experience you want, and the rewards you want, and the excitement you want. We just want you to feel like you're playing a character you want to play, not a character you have to play to get the experience you want.

In fact, the same applies to your character's appearance. We want you to feel like you're playing a character you want to play, not a character you have to play to get the experience you want.




The Attack of the Priest is back, and it's time for another quick preview of the new Priest spell: Holy Shock.


  

Holy Shock  is a very similar spell to Mind Flay  in the way it deals damage, but it has a more powerful effect. It has a chance to trigger a second Heal  or Prayer of Mending  and it also heals for an additional % of the damage dealt by your next Mind Blast  or Mind Spike 




Blue Posts

The developers have been very quiet since the release of the game and the game is in a fairly good state. We feel that the time has come to talk about it again, so here it is.

Blizzard has had a very different experience with the players in regards to the Lich King. They have been very quiet since the release of the game, and we feel that it is time for a bit of a talk about the Lich King.

The Lich King is the first of many stories to come to the story of Warcraft lore. We have a lot of stories to tell about the rise of the Lich King and the conflict between the forces of the Old Gods and the Scourge. The story of the Lich King itself is a big part of the Warcraft story, and we wanted to give you a bit more insight into how we developed the Lich King and the events that have transpired since then.

The Lich King has been a major part of the Warcraft lore since the Warcraft novels were first published in 1996, and that is reflected in the fact that we have never really fully developed him or his story. The Warcraft universe is one of the most complex, rich, and interactive worlds in gaming history, and we wanted to give players a deeper insight into the world that they have been introduced to through the Warcraft novels.

The Lich King is a dark figure, and we wanted to give players a chance to see him in the context of the other stories that are unfolding in the Warcraft universe. We knew we wanted to give players a deeper insight into the origins of the Warcraft universe, but that was a bit too broad. We wanted to give players a chance to see the rise of the Lich King and his plans for world domination, but that was a bit too broad. We wanted to give players a chance to see his secret past, but that was a bit too broad. We wanted to give players a chance to see his true intentions and motivations, but that was a bit too broad. We wanted to give players a chance to see his true intentions and intentions, but that was a bit too broad.

We wanted to give players a chance to see the rise of the Lich King as a hero, but that was a bit too broad. We wanted to give players a chance to see the rise of the Lich King as a protector, but that was a bit too broad.

Dreadwing
Dreadwing  is a boss in Mythic+ dungeons. 

He is also a pet that you can summon at will, and is a reward from the Warlords of Draenor mount achievement.

During the Warlords of Draenor encounter, the Dreadwing will be summoned at the end of the fight.

His attacks can be dodged or parried, but he will also occasionally cast an ability, such as a Heart Strike.

He has a variety of abilities, including Soul Swapping, which causes a small amount of health to be transferred to the target and cause the target to take a small amount of damage. Soul Swapping also causes the Dreadwing to cast Soul Tear, which heals the Dreadwing for a small amount.

The Dreadwing is a very dangerous creature, and should only be fought by players who have earned the achievement Defeat the Dreadwing 





The problem with the whole &quot;buffed-for-loot&quot; system is that it is also very good at being a way for players to get loot.

I think the biggest problem with the system is that it's very good at rewarding the same thing for everybody. If you don't like PvP gear, you can always get it from loot. If you don't like PvP gear, you can always get it from quest rewards. I would argue that we should probably just leave loot entirely to the players.

I think I'm getting to the point where I'm getting a little tired of having to tell players how to loot, and I think it's time for something a little different. I think that we need a new system where the loot system is a little more flexible.

The issue is that loot is also a very powerful motivator for players. I think it's important that we keep that in mind when we're designing loot, but it's also important that we understand that it can be very powerful.






&quot;You can't just compare apples to apples.&quot;

That's a quote from Jeff Kaplan, the author of the upcoming World of Warcraft: Cataclysm expansion.

The issue is, if you think about it, it's hard to compare apples to apples. In the end, we think it's pretty good that you can still find a good game on the web.

If you think about it, it's not just about what we think the game is. It's also about what it can be for you.

Games like Starcraft II, Hearthstone, and Diablo 3 have always been about player agency and player choice, but they've also always been about the experience of being a player.

We're still trying to figure out what that means for a game like Hearthstone. If you have a choice of who you play, what class you play, or what race you play, there's no way you can play the game. But if you have to pick one, you can pick whoever you want, and have fun with it.

Games like League of Legends have always had a lot of choices for players, but with the advent of the internet, it has made it easier than ever to make those choices.

I think it's fair to say that games like Diablo 3 and Starcraft II were really the first game we ever tried to make, but I think that's a mistake. The first game we ever made was a shooter game.

Blizzard was pretty straight forward. We had a single, big cinematic, then we had a lot of cinematic choice and you just had to figure out where to go and what to do. The game was pretty simple.

I think it's fair to say that it's a game that's not very accessible to a lot of people. It's not necessarily a game where you go to a place, and say, &quot;Oh, let's go find a sword.&quot; It's not a game where you just sit down and say, &quot;Well, I'm going to do this.&quot;

The one game we ever really wanted to make was a shooter game, but we didn't have a good way to do it. We decided we needed to make the game with a lot of different kinds of gameplay. And that meant that it had to be something you could play with friends.

We always had to make the game for the best possible hardware.

But it also meant that we had to make it fun. We had to make it accessible. We had to make it accessible to a wider audience. We had to make it accessible to a wider range of people. And it had to be fun.

We have made games before, and they've been pretty good. We've made games that have been pretty successful. We've made games that have been really bad. But we don't do that because we think it's fun. We do that because we think it's fun for the most part.

But I think we have to give the game a chance to be fun. We don't want it to be a shooter. I think it's too easy to have a game where you just shoot everything and shoot everything. I think the game has to be accessible and fun for everybody.

I think the game has to be fun for the people who play it. It has to be fun for the people who buy it. It has to be fun for the people who play it. But I think the most important thing is that it has to be fun for the players who play it.

I think the biggest mistake we've ever made in the past is that we think that the game has to be fun for everybody. I think that's a mistake. I think that's a mistake we've made a lot of times in the past.

I think the next game we make that's more accessible is World of Warcraft. I think that's going to be a huge hit. I think that's going to be a huge hit. I think it's going to be a big hit. I think it's going to be a big hit.

I think the thing that's going to make the game fun for everybody is that we make it fun for the people who play it. If you don't like the game, then I guess it's OK to just not play it.

But I think the game has to be fun for the people who play it. I think that's the biggest mistake we've ever made.

I think I have to admit that the game has some great moments where I think it can be really good fun. I think it's fun when it's not fun. I think it's fun when it's not fun. I think it's fun when it's fun. I think it's fun when it's fun. I think it's fun when it's fun. I think it's fun when it's fun. I think it's fun when it's fun.

I think it's






&quot;We're looking at a lot of different things to see what we can do with the new Raid Finder system and the Dungeon Finder,&quot; he said. &quot;We are also considering allowing players to create their own dungeons.&quot;

&quot;We want to make sure that the new Raid Finder doesn't take away from the fun of the old Raid Finder,&quot; he added. &quot;We'll also be making sure that we keep in mind that we have to make sure the system is as fun and as accessible as possible. There are a lot of benefits to having access to the new Raid Finder, but we also have to take that into account. It's a huge change for some players, but we think it's a necessary one.&quot;

The new raid format will be available for both PC and Mac versions.

&quot;We want to make sure that you get a great experience in the new raid system,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not going to be a sandbox. We're not going to be making sure that you can do anything you want. The goal is that you're not in the same place as players that did the old raids. We want to make sure that you're able to do your raiding, PvPing, or leveling, as well as getting gear for the new raid system. The goal is to make sure that there are no barriers to entry.&quot;

In addition, the new raid system will be available to players who have a subscription to World of Warcraft.






Achievements

A number of new achievements have been added to the game. These achievements will give you the opportunity to take on the roles of a priest, a warlock, a warrior, or a druid and do some heroic raids.




The newly-implemented Rotface ability, which has been on the PTR for a few weeks now, is finally here. This is a low-level dungeon, and the bosses are randomly generated.

The latest build of the patch is more or less complete, with a few bug fixes and the first dungeon now properly shows the &quot;3-boss&quot; icon when you are defeated. We'll probably have to wait a few more weeks to see if the next build will fix the issues with Rotface. 






The general public, including those in the media, have a very limited understanding of the battle between the Horde and the Alliance. But there is a story that tells us that the war between the Alliance and the Horde has been going on for years, and that the war has been raging for years.

The story of the Alliance and the Horde has been a war between two great empires, with the two great powers in the middle. As you might imagine, this conflict is deeply rooted in the history of the two nations, and the conflict is only beginning to heat up.

The story of the Horde and the Alliance began with the creation of the Horde and the Alliance. The story of the Alliance and the Horde began with the rise of the three great empires in the New World of Warcraft. As you might expect, the war between the Alliance and the Horde has been raging for years, and the war has only recently begun to heat up.






The casting of the new spell is done in the game, and it is NOT scripted. The animation is done by the game itself.

The spells that have been cast during the casting of the new spell are NOT scripted. They are simply a reflection of the characterâ€™s perception of the spell. 

The spell can be casted from the characterâ€™s own hand, or by a playerâ€™s spellbook, or by a spell effect.

The spell is NOT affected by the playerâ€™s own melee attacks.

Warlock PvP Gear
As I said in my post on the subject of warlocks, I am not advocating that warlocks should always do the same thing as everyone else. But, as I've said in the past, I think the warlock's abilities to single-handedly tear through a raid and take down the boss are very, very attractive to the player.

That said, I am not necessarily saying that we can just assume that warlocks are going to be the best tank in the game, or that we have to make warlocks all tank classes, just because we don't want them to be.

The issue is that it's not justifiable to make warlocks the best tank.

There is a misconception that warlocks are the best tank. I know it's a popular opinion, but we have to look at what the evidence is, and not just take it as gospel.

I'm not saying that warlocks are inherently bad tanks, but we just have to be careful that we aren't trying to make warlocks the best tank.

I'm also not saying that warlocks are inherently bad tanks, but they are very good at engaging the boss. Source 




This is an interesting design for the Flame Leviathan  boss. The Flame Leviathan  is a mini-boss, so it's not exactly the most interesting encounter. It looks like the main boss of the encounter is a little too powerful, and I am really not sure I like the design of the Flame Leviathan  at this point.








The gnomes

The gnomes are a race of gnomes, with an instinctive and almost mystical connection to the earth. They are also the last race on Azeroth, and have been the dominant force on the continent for thousands of years. Their swift, agile movement and incredible strength have made them a formidable foe to those who would seek to undermine their dominance.

The gnomes are one of the few races who can fly, but still require some level of skill to master their skills. They are also quite dangerous in the wild.

The gnomes have also recently shown an interest in exploring the world beyond their land, exploring new lands and cultures, and seeking out new sources of power.

The gnomes are not the only sentient race in Azeroth. The trolls are the most advanced, and have developed many advanced technology over the years. The gnomes have also been active in the battle against the forces of the Horde and the Alliance, using their strength and cunning to take the fight to the enemy.




A new server has been added to the game, and it looks like it's going to be a good time to make up your minds about World of Warcraft: Legion.





By now, you should have seen the news that the new Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft card backs were revealed, and youâ€™re probably wondering whatâ€™s up with the Pandaren. Blizzard Entertainmentâ€™s new card game will introduce a new race, the Pandaren, to World of Warcraft in early 2018. Weâ€™ve teamed up with Blizzard to create a new line of cards that will provide an exciting new way to experience Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft.

Weâ€™re excited to introduce the Pandaren, whoâ€™re a mysterious and mystical race thatâ€™s only slightly more unique than the human races. The Pandaren are also the first to have mastered the art of magic, and their unique magic is reflected in their unique cards. This means that youâ€™ll have to be careful when you play a Pandaren card, and be prepared to face some powerful foes, but donâ€™t worryâ€”the Pandaren have been battling the forces of the Burning Legion for a very long time.

So whatâ€™s the deal with the Pandaren?

The Pandaren are one of the most mysterious and mystical races in the world. This is because the Pandarenâ€™s magic is so powerful that it can be manifested in many forms, such as the forms of animals and plants. The Pandaren are also capable of transforming into a variety of forms, such as humanoid forms and flying mounts.

The Pandaren also have a unique way of interacting with the outside world, which is something that is extremely difficult to understand. They are also very skilled at using their unique powers to achieve their goals, which can be very dangerous or even dangerous.

The Pandaren are also the first to have mastered the art of magic, and their unique magic is reflected in their unique cards. The Pandaren have a unique way of interacting with the outside world, which is something that is extremely difficult to understand.

The Pandaren are also the first to have mastered the art of magic, and their unique magic is reflected in their unique cards. The Pandaren are also one of the few races that are immune to the effects of the Burning Legionâ€™s curse, but this is only a temporary immunity. Pandaren also have a unique way of interacting with the outside world, which can be very dangerous and dangerous.

Stormwind Venture Company. Players will find this floating in the heart of the sprawl a peaceful
place where everyone who visits will have a chance of meeting a Stormwind

replaced with new quests. These quests have been added to provide a more balanced
deeper challenge level for players.

      DRUID
     ABILITY PRUNING
     
     See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning
      class abilities. For Druids, pruning focused on removing redundant niche
      abilities, removing niche abilities that didn't make sense or needed a
      new or better or better use ability, and removing niche abilities
    
      * Fixed a bug that prevented some creatures in Dire Bear Form from appearing in
        Bears.
        
      * Fixed a bug that caused a number of weapon animations in Cat and
        Bear Form to appear larger than they actually were.

          *  [Swipe] now requires the Druid to be in an Arena, but still
             does not stack with other abilities that require that ability
              to have it counted as a base ability. In addition, the
              Swipe now does damage based on the number of players in the
               Arena.
               
               
       * Characters that have earned the Elite Mount achievement can now access the

         achievement will have access to a weekly quest line to accept daily
         quests.


Items that increase the duration of the Biscuit no longer drop.

To be clear, there is no real magic to the Warlock's spells. In fact, most spells that used to benefit you from the spellbook have been turned off by default.
This means that spells that you cast while you are outside of the caster's area of effect will no
         effect you unless you are in combat.
       * Voidwalker's Call 
         * Removed from the game.

           the level-90 Talent row. This new talent replaces the Voidwalker's
           Call talent, and summons a Voidwalker to join your party.
         * The Warlock's Call talent row has been removed and will now only be
           available to the Warlocks. The Warlock's Call talent is now available to all
           Warlock talent rows, and will create a Soulstone on the target to assist
           in transforming a target's soul into a Soul Shard.

             maps with the same tooltips.
          * Dungeons created using this new feature will now provide a detailed
            description of what each of the dungeons are comprised of.

unique class icon.

NEW HEROES

The Dark Knight is back! You have met your untimely end as
a Dark Knight with a mission to bring balance to the chaotic world of Karazhan.


PVP
       

One of the most problematic aspects of the new PVP rules is the way in which these rules are being applied.
Many players were unsure of the effect the changes to the PVP rules had on
rules such as the Drunkenness, Drunkenness, and Dampenness rules. We did a comprehensive
search of the PVP rules, and came up with four new rules that should be a
comprehensive set of changes to the older Drunkenness, Dampenness, and
Dancing and Jogging rules. These rules are being applied to all types of
intoxication. Several of the older Drunkenness, Dampenness, and Dance
rules have been re-evaluated, and many others have been adjusted. All of these
rules will no longer be applied to [Vitality], [Pleasance], or [Frost Dance] Rogues.

    * Murder: Weapon Damage, Range, and Mana cost reduced.
    * Murder: Weapon Speed, Mana Cost, and Mana Recovery reduced.
    
    Quality of life 
    
In the past, we've seen players try to apply the same logic and limitations of the old method of leveling as much as possible, while preserving their happiness and enjoyment outside of Arenas.
This philosophy has proven to be extremely frustrating for many players, as well as for us. We decided to significantly reduce the amount of
one-time quests that we perform in order to allow Forgemaster Rainseeker to remain on his
quality-controlled account.

FLYING ON TIRANDA ISLAND:

The Horde and Alliance are once again fighting over Tiran's treasures. Are they truly on the front lines of the War onandandandfor their help?

 * Macros and key bindings are now saved server-side so there is no longer a need to reconfigure them when logging in using another computer.

 * Auto-save feature has been added to the game and is now available in all skillful specializations. This feature will automatically save the specialization percentage of your profession/trinket when you log in each day. You can still select the checkbox to check out the current specialization when you want to change your mind and/or replace a lost specialization.
 * You can now re-specialize in a profession by visiting an NPC in the city or logging out with the NPC in your party. You can do this from within the profession UI or by clicking on the profession icon on the world map.

Multiple profession/trinkets can be assigned skill points on the same recipe, but the feature only works for recipes with skill points up for reagent crafting currently.
 * Reagent crafting now has a reagent cap. To account for the additional random element required to get all the ingredients to a reagent, the cap has been increased to 50.
 * You can now assign skill points to multiple recipes that require less reagents, by visiting an NPC in the city or logging in with the NPC in your party. You will not be able to use this feature for recipes that require gold, silver, or copper.
 * Multiple reagents can be assigned skill points on the same recipe, but the reagent cap has been increased to 50.
 * Gold, silver, and copper will no longer be awarded for the same recipe if a player obtains both the materials by a specific combination. For example, if a player obtains both gold and copper from a recipe and then silver from another recipe, the silver will be awarded first, followed by gold.
 * Players will no longer be able to use the &quot;Refresh All&quot; button to refresh an arena team before a scheduled game. The Refresh All button appears when a team is due a forfeit and will not refresh when a team has not been due a forfeit.
 * Players will no longer be able to use the &quot;Random Matchmaking&quot; feature to queue for a specific game type under specific restrictions. For example, someone who attempts to queue for Conquest of the Eastern Plaguelands or Battle for Azeroth PvP will be placed into a queue for PvP only Azeroth games, or for a time when the PvP cap is reached.
 * Random Matchmaking: In addition to allowing players to queue for specific games, players can now randomly find opponents with the Random option in either scenario. When playing against someone randomly, the Random option will always show as available, regardless of any previous opponents that may have been in the queue.

====================
A short time ago we introduced you to the concept of a &quot;turbo charge&quot;, whereby a player's powers and abilities temporarily increase in efficiency by applying a small amount of additional damage or healing to an already-existing effect on the target. Today we're introducing you to the concept of a &quot;turbo-honor charge&quot;, whereby when demonstrating mastery of a role, your auto-attack hits an additional nearby target for a large damage bonus.

Together, these two changes represent the first step toward what we hope to see in World of Warcraft: instant, automatic, customizable, peer-to-peer damage and healing. While we still have lots of work to do in order to fully realize this vision, we can at least say that it's a start.

EDITOR'S NOTE: This article discusses an ongoing topic within the World of Warcraft development team. We'd like to hear your thoughts on the subject. Please send suggestions to the forum administrator.

====================
BATTLE FOR AZEROTH SEASON 2

-Between the events of the first and second season of Battle for Azeroth, the night elves have been attacked by an unknown, deadly force. The Warchief believes this attack was ordered by Wyrmrest Accord, and that the Nightfallen who perpetrated the attack is indeed the one responsible. The Warchief leads a strike team of twelve heroes, led by Warchief Kael'thas, on a daring escape from Orgrimmar. The Warchief and his men face an overwhelming number of Ogri'la, but they will soon run out of options. The Ogriâ€™la they face will be no match for the Warchiefâ€™s strength and determination. Players will now be able to lead a strike team in combat, starting at level 100. The Ogriâ€™la in the first season of Battle for Azeroth will be much tougher than they appear in the second.

-The second season of Battle for Azeroth will feature a new balance of druid talent trees. As part of this process, we have made several changes to druid talents.
    * The level cap has been increased to 100.
    * The Rejuvenation bar is now grayed out.
    * New Ability: Solarium Barrage (Level 100).
    * Casting a longer channeled spell (e.g. [Solaric Power]) will wake up your next sleeping target.
    * Healing targets over level 60 now receive twice the expected bonus to healing from [Healing Rain].
    *  [Feast of Souls] will no longer cancel upon taking damage.

====================
The amount of newly allocated gold in the game should be fairly consistent between acts 6 and 11 of any given dungeon. However, in order to make even modest amounts of this new Conquest gear possible, we've raised its item level considerably. This means that players will generally see a larger selection of items in their inventories if they are geared toward Gold or Honorbound gear. In addition, existing items that upgrade in quality to higher-tier versions should be able to upgrade further, as we've done for other items in this series.

Now available are the ability to wear special mounts in your off-duty outfits. While in one of the game's three racial archetypes (Human, Orc, or Tauren), you'll be able to represent your faction in the Mount or Stand Up specializations.

NEW FEATURE: HALLOW'S END

We're thrilled at the reception this event has received. Not only have we had many requests for this endgame endgame gear, but many players have been incredibly kind and generous with their suggestions of which unique alternate methods they might use to get to Halloween's end. In addition to all of the above, there's been a special Halloween event in Stormwind this last weekend that involved trick-or-treating. Thanks!

THE STORY OF BORDER CORNER

Nearly two years have passed since the Alliance and the Horde laid siege to Hellfire Citadel â€“ the heart of the Burning Legion's power â€“ and the war that followed has seen the heroes of the Horde and Alliance enter a new phase of their conflict.


While the war in eastern Plaguelands has seen great valor on the part of both sides, an equally great effort has been made to minimize casualties amongst the ranks of both factions. As such, the level of combat in the war has been gradually lowered over time â€“ gradually opening the way for a possible future New Azeroth!

DARKFRONT

The High Warlord Kil'jaeden has forged an accord with the Witch-King Azeroth to lead the way against the Legion. The Alliance has agreed to aid the war effort, while the Legion has been folded into the War on Terror. The two factions will now each lead a wing of a wing that will attack the enemy capital â€“ the exact location of this new Nagrand raid dungeon has yet to be confirmed.

NAGRAN

Nagrand has been added to the game world as a fully-fledged zone with a number of new features, including an exclusive dungeon for Legion, a new chapter of the War on Terror expansion that is set in Nagrand, and a raid-style version of the raid dungeon, all of which can be attempted at level 80. In addition to the dungeon and raid sections, Nagrand also features a faction-based aspect, meaning players can visit their faction-based counterparts to obtain the requisite reputation to challenge them â€“ all of these efforts will be at no additional cost.

THE LEGENDARY QUEST CONTINUES

Years after the events of the previous expansion, the Legion have breached the Nighthold and begun to explore the galaxy. In an effort to locate and rescue Nathaniel Garrosh, the heroes have managed to gather considerable resources, including the Orb of Deception, which promises to open a new chapter in the War on Terror. However, the Orb of Deception has a flaw â€“ if the heroes are to discover the full extent of the Legion's reach, then vengeance will be too great a price to pay for victory.

THE LEGENDARY QUEST CONTINUES

Years have passed since the Nighthold's Guardians were last active, and the Legion have apparently reached the end of their destructive journey on Azeroth. With nothing to lose, the heroes have taken to colonizing the galaxy with a view to one day returning to reclaim our lost home.

PROFESSIONS

 * Players may discover 3 new recipes that can be combined to create legendary items that can be used to directly upgrade a legendary item from the previous version of the expansion.
 * Players may discover 3 new recipes that can be combined to create legendary items that can be used to directly upgrade a legendary item from the previous version of the expansion.

      SHADOW CHANGES
      
      Shadow priests had one large problem toward the end of Mists of Pandaria: single-target damage. Their AoE and multi-DoT damage was some of the best around, so they still ended up competitive on most fights. But, in any fight that was mostly single-target, they felt lacking. Additionally, one of the new stats we're adding in Warlords of Draenor, Multistrike, is almost exactly what their current Mastery, [Shadowy Recall], does for DoTs. So, we took these two problems and came up with a change that we think will solve both of them. The result is a new Mastery: Shadowy Recall, a new Mastery for Shadow Priests that primarily increases the single-target portion of their DoTs but also works well for multistrikes.
      
      
       *  [Silence] has been replaced with [Silence].
       *  [Silence] now costs 30 Energy in addition to its current effects.
       *  [Void Tendrils] now deal 15% less damage.
      
      
      Of course, in an ideal world, all three stats would go into zero when Void Tendrils or Void Ebbers are destroyed, leaving only 3 active stats. That's why we buffed both of these abilities, and why we removed the 3rd ability altogether. However, in practice, it's not that simple. Sometimes destroying a tank's primary target means that that target doesn't get affected by our defensive stats, and those that are not tanking generally do not benefit from that destruction. Therefore, we buffed them differently. This will allow more tanks to benefit from these stats, and still will, but will not defeat the point of destroying secondary targets.
      
      
       *  [Summon Darkglare] now lasts 8 seconds (was 5 seconds).
       *  [Darkglare]'s damage has been increased by 250%.
       *  [Shadowform] no longer removes movement-impairing effects.
       *  [Void Bolt] now deals 105% of weapon damage (was 75%).
       *  [Void Bolt] now deals 75% of weapon damage (was 60%).

WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON D.C. â€“ Today, April 2, 2015, marks the one-year anniversary of the Burning Crusade. The Burning Crusade was a massive success, earning Blizzard Entertainmentâ€”and subsequently, World of Warcraftâ€”over 10 million unique players. Following the success of the Burning Crusade, Blizzard decided to take a fresh look at their Path of Exile system. They decided to change up the Order Lock system in Hearthstone, and added a fresh, new feature, Random Encrypted Matter.

The Random Encrypted Matter system is what makes the upcoming [Grand Unified Planets] unique. Grand Unified Planets is what makes all future expansions free-for-all, with each expansion requiring a unique lock to be obtained. As such, this plan was very important to us. Therefore, we're changing the system to allow players the chance to unify their Order Locks in one place, at anytime.

INTRODUCING RAIDS
We wanted to present an updated, more fun way for raiding with friends new and old. That's why we're introducing Raid Finder, a new system that lets you queue for and join a raid of any size for any content type, at a moment's notice. Not on the same day, but at a moment's notice.

RAIDS
TRAVELING IS NOW A THING

With the launch of Battle for Azeroth, we set out to make gearing your class or spec a little easier. To that end, we've made it so you don't need to grind through item level 1-10 to get the occasional item that might drop. You can now do all of the hard, time-consuming, role-specific work yourself, instead of having a team of people tell you what to do.

We're also pleased to announce that all 9-slot raid bags have been reduced to 5-slot configurations, so you can now take advantage of the reduced pricing we've seen with this new system. 5-slot systems are available for those raiding with four or more slots, 4-slot systems are available for those raiding with three or more slots, and 1-10 slot raid bags are available for those raiding with all of the required slots.

One major difference between this new system and the old system is that we've made it so you don't need to grind through item levels 1-10 to get items that might drop from random (non-boss) encounters. The end result is that you won't necessarily be broke if you drop an item in 10-slot (or even 1-10) RAID Finder (or any other random drop), but you won't be broke if you drop that same item in a normal raid either.

RAID GUILDS

We've added the Riot Guard to the new Raid Finder (and the existing Raid Finder) as a means to reduce queue times. The Riot Guard can be found in the same raid frames as other raid-specific characters, but has a 100% chance to drop an item in Raid Finder difficulty (up from 50% chance).

STORY AND WORLD

Many changes have been made to the story behind the cataclysm world events: the invasion of Kalimdor, the rise of the Burning Legion, and the War Campaign. These world events have been overhauled to provide a smoother transition into the War Campaign.

NPC CHANGES

Many NPCs that are not supposed to be in the raid have been changed to appear in a raid, either by changing their color or their model. While this fixes an issue with previous patches, it also introduces an entirely new system of handling things in Raid Finder (which we call â€˜Cruisin' the Truest) difficulty. This new system makes all NPCs relative no more 'forbidden fruit.'

This world event also saw the addition of a new mechanic:

* All nearby players become invisible when [Cruisin' the Truesteel] is activated.
 * The mechanic works exactly like a [Collectronic Module], except with a twist: when activated, it also causes the camera to be turned to that which drives the characterâ€™s thrusters, thus obscuring their actual location.

The hidden loot in this raid was that which dropped, not who dropped it. As such, it has been scaled back in value to be commensurate to the size of the reward.

PROFESSIONS

Many new recipes have been added to assist players in obtaining the resources they need to power their raid.


 * Many recipes in high demand by dungeon groups will now require significantly less [Collectronic Module] schematics to create.
 * A new high-end profession that only players of the appropriate class can acquire is now available.
 * Small but significant improvements have been made to many recipes in the high-end profession skill tree. Many of the recipes in this tree will be off-spec and thus unable to be applied to a non-
====================
Event Time: The first three boss encounters of the day are now available and battle for a chance at a rare gem that can grant a glimpse of victory!
Featuring a host of new additions, including a glimpse of victory for the Horde at the Battle of Dazar'alor, the Isle of Dread and the Dalaran Sewer, The Third War Campaign is open once again this year on November 14th.
ALL NEW FEATURE: ADVENTURE GUIDE
Adventure Guide NPCs have been added to a number of new encounters throughout the world. In addition, players can now navigate through these encounters on a map, enabling them to find and fight the appropriate creatures without constantly looking for markers.

In this new version, you'll find a new &quot;marshal&quot; (pronounced /ËˆmÉ›rdÊ’l), a faction NPC who'll direct your party toward the Adventure Guide if you're in a group, and who'll offer whatever guidance you need during a particular encounter. Marshals are friendly toward NPCs, and will usually lead players to a location that's more conducive to their type of adventure.

INSPECT

A new inspect bar has been added to the world. You can use this new interface to inspect other players, trade goods, and look for additional rewards.

UNIQUE
A number of unique items have been added to the treasure lists for Brawler's Guild.

LEGENDARY ITEM ADJUSTMENTS:
DEATH KNIGHT
ALLIED RACES

FIGHTERS of both the blade and the shield are now considered to be of the same race, and will thus receive a reduction in rewards from the original quest chain.


The two-headed ogre mage, however, still cannot be paired with a pair of four-headed plate dragons.

ILLUMINATION

All new achievements and rewards have been added for the Illidan lore quest.

SKETTIS

The Skyguard, Shaâ€™tari warriors specializing in their command of the skies above Shattrath, have acquired an ability that allows them to see the stars. Those who understand the language of the Skyguard will be able to learn the plot of this quest.

TRAVELING

A number of new flying exploits have been added, including a ride-able zeppelin, the Kodo Caravan, and the Kodo Transport.

USER INTERFACE

 * Quest Tracking has been added to the Inbox.
 * Dungeon Journal has been expanded with new information on all raid bosses.

ALPHA

ALPHA is a new additive shader technology that replaces OpenGL for rendering in D3D games. It adds an additional texture resolution, multiplies the shader's frequency by a fixed number, and provides better performance on many modern shaders.

NEW FEATURE: FINE PRINT

With this patch we introduce the new feature Fine Print. The FINE PRINT texture format has been improved to 1x per pixel, 4x for World of Warcraft patches, and will be the main interface for many new features in the future. Before we dive into details of how this new interface will work, however, a couple of notes.

Patch 7.0.3a has limited support for new graphic cards from the NVIDIA Corporation. Previous to this patch, all NVIDIA cards were not correctly patched to 7.0.3a.

We have not had any success with automating the hotfix to the issues with the Dragon Sleeves.

Currently, in order to comply with a new patch requirement of Dragon Sleeves 7.0.3a, all Dragon Sleeves will require a patch 7.0.3a hotfix.

      One of the most talked about changes in the WoW game has been the Alignment system. The entire game has been redesigned to be less intuitive, more accessible, and more intuitive. We've broken down the Alignment system into 4 different phases: Pre-Alignment, Alignment, Post-Alignment, and Flexibility.
      
      
      Before we talk about how this change affects you, let's first clarify what exactly this is. The Pre-Alignment phase allowed you to make tough calls about which expansion to support. We're pretty sure most players found that the Alignment they chose was no different than the previous version, but hey, it was a change!
      
      
      So, what does it do? It smooths out the initial announcement of an expansion by giving players a reason to want to support it. It also helps players avoid making the wrong choice between an expansion and a random pre-release build.
      
      
       * Pre-Alignment 
          * Alignment points now determine which pre-release content you get to in each patch. Points can be earned for Honorable Kills, which means &quot;for which realm&quot; the bonus content is applied.
          * Points can be earned for completing specific objectives, both inside and outside of the game.
          * Alignment points are no longer based on realm power or account bonuses. 
              * For Honorable Kills, characters earn extra points based on the modifiers of each bonus.
              * For example, a character who earns 2400 Alignment points for completing the objectives of &quot;A Feast for the Seven&quot; receives a 2400 Alignment bonus instead of a normal 2400.
             
             
          * After the official announcement of an expansion, updates on how the content will be received quickly follow.
          * Realm by Realm Testing 
               * All new PvP items can be on the PTR from the Fantasy layer.
               * Characters can test their wings on the Arathi Basin battlefield.
               * For additional notes on testing process changes, see the blog titled: Patch 6.0.2 Patch Notes: Testing Realm Issues.
             
             
          * Characters can join as individuals in a raid or split up into smaller groups for a limited time in order to test new content and meet the requirements of a new raid. 
               * For example, you can test with 10 other individuals or try to find 5 others to join together in a raid.
               * You can queue as an individual and then as a group, or you can test as a group and then as an individual.
              * You can be in a group and a queue and still access the same features, but you can only enter the queue and be in that group or queue for one hour.
              * The raid window will remain open while you are in a group or queue, so you can quickly pop out of the group or queue and quickly reopen the raid window to test your group or queue status.
             
             
          * A weekly cooldown will also be applied to keep you posted on when and how often to show up in Ashran.
         
         
      
      NEW FEATURE: FOLLOWERS
      
      New followers can be earned by following a particular player or following a specific pattern. Followers can be earned primarily through

FROST PRISON

Many races in the frozen wastes know of Frost Prisonâ€”its dark secret, where secrets of the Frost Legion are kept for the pitiable champions of the Horde and Alliance to read. But few know its true purpose: to be the vanguard of a massive invasion of the icy wastes against the denizens of Shattrath City.

Shadows of Elune

Elune's light is waning, and she will not stand idly by while the Horde and Alliance are forced to fight their own war. The two races who will assume the Lich King's place in the Lich King's Shadow gallery when the time comes will be few. The Scourge have spies amongst the Kirin Tor, and this information will play a major role in leading the Scourge into the invasion.

War Missions

While the War Missions in Warlords of Draenor are focused on the invasion of Draenor, players will occasionally stumble across a mission that could turn the tide of the war. This mission, which appears in your journal when you first embark on a War Mission, will be of particular interest to you.


The mission you discover will directly result in turning the tide of the war, by aiding your faction in the invasion of Draenor.

UNDOCUMENTED MISSION: UL'AMIR

 * During the invasion of Outland by forces of the Horde, a group of trolls goes by the nom de guerre UL'AMIR. The group is led by a mysterious figure known as the &quot;Shadow Succubus,&quot; and is engaged in a fierce battle with the forces of the Horde and Alliance.
 * During the battle, a mysterious girl is kidnapped by the mercenaries known as the &quot;Shadow Thieves. The Shadow Thieves are engaged in a fierce war with the Outland rangers, and the kidnapped girl is eventually rescued by the heroes.

DARK FRONTS

 * Due to the constant presence of the Frostwolf clan throughout the years, all members of the Frostwolf clan are now considered honorable.
 * Due to the constant presence of the Bloodfang clan throughout the years, all members of the Bloodfang clan are now considered honorable.

 * Due to the constant presence of the Tiger Clan throughout the years, all members of the Tiger Clan are now considered honorable.
 * Due to the constant presence of the Gray Clan throughout the years, all members of the Gray Clan are now considered honorable.
 * Due to the constant presence of the White Clan throughout the years, all members of the White Clan are now considered honorable.

PVP

 * Due to the amount of Conquest Points awarded for a win, players will be capped at their respective weekly cap.
 * The Conquest reward for a win above the weekly cap now increases at a rate of 5 Conquest Points per week ending on the 5th week of Season 2, instead of increasing at a rate of 10 Conquest Points per week ending on the 22nd.
 * Weekly Conquest reward caps have been changed. To better balance the amount of Conquest Points awarded for a win, members of the team that currently has the highest weekly cap will receive the benefit of the cap increase at the expense of any previous week's reward.
 * Tiebreakers and Bonus Events
    * Winning a tiebreaker during the first week of Season 2 will award players with a weekly bonus of 200 Conquest Points, while the bonus for a win during the second week will award players with a weekly bonus of 150 Conquest Points.
    * Bonus Event: Arena of Valor has been added to the weekly Conquest reward rotation.

DESCRIPTION
January 22, 2019
For ages untold, Dazar'alor has stood at the center of the great and powerful Zandalari empire. Its guards have thwarted numerous attempts on King Rastakhan's life, and it has endured trials both ancient and new. But as war reaches the shores of Zuldazar, the Alliance embarks on a daring gambit to besiege the golden pyramid and sever the Zandalari's bond to the Horde.

December 10, 2018
The war raging across Azeroth between Alliance and Horde has intensified. As the Alliance lays plans to retake Darkshore and regain a foothold in Kalimdor, both factions have redoubled their attacks across the zone.

NEW RAID: THRONE OF THUNDER
BATTLEGROUND OF THUNDER

The devastating events of the War Campaign have spawned a new 3-boss raid, complete with new rewards. Those interested in the War Campaign can now undertake the dungeon from either Hardmode or Normalmode, and loot the secrets that will lead to victory.

NEW FEATURE: APEXIS CRYSTALS

These new crystals are positioned higher on the crystal tower than usual, meaning that they'll affect abilities like [Metamorphosis], [Frostfire Bolt], [Blizzard], [Frost Armor], [Ice Lance], and [Frost Armor].

NEW FREIGHTY QUEEN

A free-for-all for all-
====================
New high-level Artifact glyphs can be found in the Broken Isles and introduced at the Legion launch. The glyph involved is â€¦ well, you'll figure it out.

NEW HIGH-LEVEL ARMOR: ARMOR OF JUSTICE

 * In a world with a new breed of powerful heroes known as the Legion, Plate of Justice might just be the perfect addition to your collection.

BATTLE PETS: PETS OF WAR AND RESOLVE

Many special, unique, and fantastic new battle pets have been added to the Broken Isles. In this brave new pet regime, you'll no longer be able to trade in your current battle pet for a legendary pet.

FIGHT THE STUPID: THE BUG IS IN, TAKE THE F*CK OUT

 * Fight the Stupid: The bug that crashes the game when trying to open the loot window has been fixed. Apparently, players with Revive abilities were having trouble overwriting old loot.

RAID: THE FUCKING KEEP

Wrath of the Titans is upon us, and this time the Titans are not appeased. You'll head to the Dark Portal in Plane of Shadow to face the wrath of the Burning Legion.

RAID: HELLFIRE CITADEL

Raise your sword or shield, and prepare for an all-new encounter with Hellfire Citadel's fearsome warriors. In this new raid, your character will be assaulted by the very soul of the Illidari, starting the quest that begins your journey toward understanding the Broken Isles.

NEW RAID: CRUCIBLE OF THUNDER

 * In a world without electricity, a group of unlikely heroes stumble upon an ancient ritual that could unleash the might of the Legion. But this is just the beginning. Before long, they'll be faced with the fearsome task of defending their home from the Legion's reachâ€¦ before leaping into the portal that leads to the surface.

World of Warcraft Patch 8.2.5 Interview Hi Christie Golden, I know you've been working closely with the game and art teams, and your influence on helping the story feel more cohesive, immersive and exciting has definitely been appreciated. What was your input on the patch tomorrow?

World of Warcraft Patch 8.2.5 Interview Hey! Josh Allen we felt that you might have some anecdotes to share about your shaman in anticipation for the end of the war campaign tomorrow! Any insights or comments? 



In preparation for the War Campaign, Draenor has seen a drastic increase in both defense and offense, with much of the former zone now belonging to the opposing faction.
          * As the conflict between the Horde and the Alliance continues unabated, all players will now find themselves with all of their assigned starting zones set at their initial preferences, with a single &quot;accept&quot; button for the entire campaign.
          * Learn more about how the War Campaign will work in our blog titled: Patch 8.2.5 – The Alliance Vs. The Horde: The Alliance Wins!
          * Additionally, for those realms that did not choose to participate in the War Campaign, players will now be able to opt out of the conflict by visiting their respective Troll, Gnome, or Orc camps and accepting the &quot;Defend&quot; tab.
          * The &quot;Forbearance&quot; option can also be selected while in a raid, and will cause the offending race to be excused from the conflict.
          * The Gnomish Racial &quot;Hardiness&quot; ability is now noted in the combat log, and can be seen by both the tank and the healer.
          * The &quot;Gnomish Overpower&quot; ability is now properly penalized when used.

       * To access the new FACTION LIST, players must select a faction from the list in the UI, then click the &quot;Faction&quot; tab at the bottom of the list. From there, players can mark all of the available faction slots for a zone, allowing them to quickly and easily group with other players of the same faction.
       * FACTION GUILDS are now available. Players may join as many as three factions from a single action bar. Players may be in a group for a given faction at a time, but only on a limited number of actions.

       * If an epic item has been looted off of a pre-Burning Crusade item and you have one of the pre-Burning Crusade items, you can still use that item until November 13, 2019.
       * Items that have been looted off of previous expansions of World of Warcraft but not made available through the game will continue to be made available through expansions that were released prior to the date that the item is obtained.

           * Before we talk about tomorrow's content update, there's a quick note about our plans for the future. Our biggest complaint with Warlords of Draenor so far has been that it felt like a 'starter' expansion instead of a full 3-part content package. Part of what makes Warlords of Draenor unique is that it's not a typical 'starter' for a MMORPG. That being said, we still like that there's a chance for new players to stumble upon the game during this early access period, so that we can get feedback on how the expansion plays out during its duration.

       * While you and other raid leaders prepare for battle, gather materials, and craft powerful new items, you'll occasionally have the opportunity to interact with an unseen benefactor.
       * All of the sudden, you'll be able to walk through the world and not be attacked by everything? Really?!
       * The level of the raid will be different based on the difficulty of the boss (listed at the top of the page).
       * The random element of the Veldt puzzle will allow you to test your mettle against an unknown foe.
       * The Veldt puzzle will now award different amounts of reputation depending on your score at the end of the dungeon.
       * On the eighth floor, you'll unlock the Veldt Puzzle, an additional dungeon for Blackwing Lair.
       * Blackwing Lair will be available with the release of Patch 8.2.5.

World of Warcraft Patch 8.2.5 Interview Hi Ian Hazzikostas, any surprises in the culmination of the war campaign tomorrow? 
          * In preparation for the War Campaign, Draenor has seen a drastic increase in both defense and offense, with much of the former zone now belonging to the opposing faction.
          * As the conflict between the Horde and the Alliance continues unabated, all players will now find themselves with all of their assigned starting zones set at their initial preferences, with a single &quot;accept&quot; button for the entire campaign.
          * Learn more about how the War Campaign will work in our blog titled: Patch 8.2.5 – The Alliance Vs. The Horde: The Alliance Wins!
          * Additionally, for those realms that did not choose to participate in the War Campaign, players will now be able to opt out of the conflict by visiting their respective Troll, Gnome, or Orc camps and accepting the &quot;Defend&quot; tab.
          * The &quot;Forbearance&quot; option can also be selected while in a raid, and will cause the offending race to be excused from the conflict.
          * The Gnomish Racial &quot;Hardiness&quot; ability is now noted in the combat log, and can be seen by both the tank and the healer.
          * The &quot;Gnomish Overpower&quot; ability is now properly penalized when used.
          * The &quot;Might Of The Many&quot; achievement for obtaining 5 PvP trinkets has been reset to award rank 3 gear.
          * The &quot;Unbridled Fury&quot; achievement for obtaining 100 non-combat pet reports has been reset to award rank 1 gear.

       * Bonus healing received from sources has been increased so that it will start to add to the amount of bonus healing from sources given that the bonus will be multiplied by the amount of bonus healing in that source.

World of Warcraft Patch 8.2.5 Interview Hi Ian Hazzikostas, any surprises in the culmination of the war campaign tomorrow? 
          * Great news all players! On the heels of the devastating events of Cataclysm, Azeroth is finally getting a new expansion! Check out what Patch 8.2.5 has to say about the Warfront world over at the Blizzard website.
         
         
       * New Features: Feral Speed, Raid Finder, and the Warfront scoreboard are now live.

Chloe Dyce

Senior Game Designer

World of Warcraft

Patch 8.2.5a


Interview conducted by Neve Campbell, Senior Game Designer for the Cataclysm expansion.

Q: Alright guys, time for a quickie Q&amp;A. I know you've been hard at work on some new Cataclysm stuff, so this is a quick Q&amp;A sort of thing.

A: Sure thing.

Q: I'm curious what you've been up to these days.

A: I've been playing video games, actually. I mean, I've been playing World of Warcraft all weekend long.

Q: Do you have any plans for an expansion to Mists of Pandaria?

A: No, no plans. That'd be kind of weird.

Q: Any plans for a biopic on Martin Luther King?

A: Oh my god no. I mean, I guess there's always the possibility, but we're not entirely sure what that would actually entail.

Q: Any updates on the Broken Shore raid?

A: Well, we're not entirely sure what's been going on with the Broken Shore, but it's been bugging us ever since Sean Murray showed up at Blizzcon that it's a whole lot better now.

Q: Any plans for an expansion to Serpentshrine Caverns?

A: We've been hard at work on that, but it may not be ready for prime time just yet.

Q: Do you have any plans for an expansion to Stygian Depths?

A: We're not entirely sure what the hell Stygian Darkrune is, but it's a whole lot more interesting than you remember.

Q: Do you have any plans for an expansion to Blackfathom Deeps?

A: We're not entirely sure what the hell Akkiris Ambushers are, but at least they're not Titans.

*Note: all questions were removed due to the FAQ being so damn dense.

RACES: GENERAL

 * Orc and troll shamans now have their own distinct &quot;tradewalk&quot; ability.
 * Racial Attribute Bonuses: These bonuses have been recalibrated to even out the amount of starting health on the various races, and have been adjusted so that all races start with a standardized level of stamina.

GENERAL

 * Starting Health: The amount of bonus health that a character gains per 10

Chloe Monks: Orbs' effects can now stack, and they can be used in all sorts of combinations!

Chloe Monks: Orbs can be destroyed, replaced, or tracked, and they cost chi to use!

Chloe Monks: Orbs can be used to forever change the look and feel of an area, person, or thing

Christie Golden: Thank you! I'm sorry, I can't offer much insight into the game design process other than to say that it was very well-received. However, I can offer some insight into why we're doing this in the first place.
   
   
    * Over the years we've added significantly more new spells and abilities to the game than we've removed. The vast majority of those that have been integrated into the game are still there (some for free, some for a small fee).
   
   
   
 * Additionally, every class has an extensive list of available spell books that can be purchased from the class trainer. Many of those spells and abilities will be familiar from previous expansions.
 * Many players have asked for more randomization in Raid design. We've taken an extensive look at all available randomization methods, and find that none of them really add up. We've chosen to use a simple, yet effective random number generator (like the Random Dungeon feature in the Battlegrounds) to provide players with a sense of randomness, instead of having to guess which spells are coming from a random book.
 * Due to the random nature of many of the game's systems, including the advancement of technology, there may be hidden bonuses or changes that will make a particular dungeon experience more random than intended. We try to set as few exceptions as possible, but if it doesn't meet your needs, please don't hesitate to ask.
   
   
 * Dungeons now have a small chance to reward specific items from specific sources.
 * Randomized Battlegrounds
    * As part of our continued efforts to randomize the Battleground system, each time an Arena team chooses to use an Arena Random Battleground, they also randomly select the next Battleground.
   
   
 * Randomized Battlegrounds
    * No longer will randomize Battlegrounds using the Random Dungeon feature. Arena Random Battlegrounds will continue to be performed based on the same criteria used for Random Dungeon.
    * In addition to using the Random Dungeon option, players also have the option to queue for any of the available Random Battlegrounds by entering the random Battleground selection form.
       * Randomized Battleground queues will not randomly select any Battlegrounds. If selected, players will be randomly placed into either

            <Text>The current state of the game, and any potential changes, are being looked at.

When we are ready, the PTR realms will be available for testing.

There are a lot of changes and fixes in the game that are coming in the next major patch. We are constantly working on new content and the new systems that we are introducing are a huge part of that.

If you are playing on a non-PvP realm, you may have some issues with the game because of things like guilds, level cap, etc. We are working to resolve these issues and give you a chance to get into the game.

If you are playing on a PvP realm, you may have issues because of PvP balance, the addition of new PvP gear, etc. We are working to address these issues.

The game is constantly evolving and evolving. If you are experiencing any issues, please let us know! 

In the next major patch, we will be removing the PvP requirements and allowing players to queue for PvP realms.

The game has changed a lot over the years. We don't want to repeat that process, but we do want to make sure the game is still evolving. 

There is a lot of information coming in the next major patch, so we are still updating on what is coming in the next major patch. 



Lore

The name of this world has been a part of the lore of Azeroth for millennia. It is a place that was created through the efforts of countless artificers and monks of the Order of the White Crane, the first of many great technological advancements that would change the face of the land and the cosmos.

The ancient world of the mists of Pandaria was an ancient one, one that was filled with mystical and mystical energies, in which the greatest of all the worlds lay.

The journey of the Burning Legion led the other elemental spirits into a new world, one that was much more chaotic than the one they had known before the world was forged.

The world was cursed by the Legion, and the curse of the Sha. The Sha were a powerful force of darkness that ruled over the moon and the stars, and the world was in a state of chaos, as they had all the time in the world to prepare for an attack.

The very concept of an elemental being was a new concept, and it was a time that the world was full of great and powerful creatures that had been born from the chaos and chaos of the world.

The five great races of the world were the ones that were most responsible for the downfall of the world, and their actions were the reason behind the destruction of the world.
 


But there's no real question. We're not removing any class from the game just because it's a bad idea.

There's a difference between bad ideas and bad philosophy. We're trying to make sure that the philosophy is the same for PvP as it is for PvE.

The problem with PvP, specifically, is that it's a game where there's a lot of numbers and a lot of things to take into account. The game is supposed to be fun and not a series of numbers.

If we just removed PvP, it wouldn't be a problem, but we don't want to just remove everything. 

If we just buffed PvP, then the game would be a lot better, but there are a lot of variables that go into PvP balance. For example, in PvP, we have to balance it to prevent it from being a major contributor to the PvP community, and that's a pretty big challenge.

I think the issue is the game design itself. I don't think we're trying to remove any class or specialization from the game, but we're trying to make sure that the game design is the same for PvP as it is for PvE.

It's a big undertaking. It's a lot of work. We have to be very careful about how much we can take away from PvP, but we're going to try to be a little bit more careful. 

I don't think there's any doubt that PvP is a big part of the game. I think we're trying to make sure that PvP is the same thing for PvE as it is for PvP. 

So, PvP is a big part of the game. But I don't think it's a problem for PvE as it is for PvP.


To start, let's say you have two players and a boss, which should be a fairly easy encounter.

If you have the right number of people, it should be a fairly easy fight.

If you have the wrong number of people, it might be a tougher fight.





A message to all those who have been killed by a player on a server: I'm sorry. We're working on it, but it's not the time or the resources.

There are a few factors at play here.

1 A player can be killed by a player and then killed again and no one can claim the server dead.

2 The kill isn't a player's fault. It's the system's fault. It's a bug.

It's also not a bug that should be fixed.

I'll be the first to admit that there's a lot of people out there who would like to see some kind of system to track this, but there are a lot of other players out there who would like to see a system that makes this easy.



  



BlizzCon in Anaheim
BlizzCon will take place in Anaheim, CA this year! The show will take place on Saturday, February 7th, and Sunday, February 8th, and will feature panels, contests, workshops, vendors, games, panels, competitions, and more! 

If you’re attending, don’t forget to tune in to the Anaheim LIVE stream on Tuesday, February 11th at 10:00 a.m. PST.







General

Fixed a bug that caused a player's weapon to not be removed when they use a weapon enchant on it.








The recent announcement that Blizzard is acquiring the game company behind World of Warcraft and StarCraft II has caused some people to get very excited. 

However, Blizzard has been in the business of making games for decades, and many of the developers who have been working on World of Warcraft have already left the company to pursue other projects.

The only thing that remains is the game.

If you are one of those people, we will be hiring. We are looking for a talented Coder, Front End Web Developer, Front End Web Developer, Front End Web Developer,

It would be nice to have a few more options on how to handle the new trinket colors. i.e. when to use it, when to use it, etc.
The trinket color scheme is a little different than other trinkets. Celestalon 

PvP
As a hunter, I've noticed that hunter tanks are having trouble in PvP. Any idea why?
There's a lot of factors that go into the problem. It's not just the current trinket, but the armor-pen system and other things that we're looking at. holinka

Is it possible that the PvP gear is actually better than the PvP gear because of the PvP gear? Or is it better because of the PvP gear?

Greetings, I'm Chris Robinson, and today we are taking a look at the new deck from the Mists of Pandaria expansion, the Kobolds and Trolls. This is the first in a series of articles that will delve into the design and implementation of Kobolds and Trolls.

A

The first thing we have to do is make sure that we don't get too much out of the way early. We want the Kobolds and Trolls to be the standard for every class in the game, and we want to keep that feeling. They are definitely going to be a part of the game for a while, but we are also going to have to make sure they aren't too overpowered or overpowered at the same time. For example, there is a buff in the game that increases the health of the Kobolds and Trolls by 15%, but when you kill a Kobold or Troll, it only increases their health by 15%.

The Kobolds and Trolls are also the only class that doesn't have a set set set of abilities, and we don't want to limit their gameplay to a specific set of abilities. We also don't want to create a situation where the Kobolds and Trolls can't play with the other classes because that would be boring. We can see where the Kobolds and Trolls could be fun, but they are going to be fun in the game for a long time.

The Kobolds and Trolls aren't the only class that has an ability set, but they are the only class that has a set of abilities. So, we have to make sure that the Kobolds and Trolls can't just spam the same abilities all the time. They are going to have to have a variety of abilities, but we have to make sure that they aren't overpowered. The Kobolds and Trolls are going to be a bit weaker than the other classes, but they are still going to be a fun class.

Now, as a Kobolds and Trolls player, I am happy to have a lot of fun, and I am still going to have fun playing the game. However, I am aware that there is some frustration and some confusion about what the game is all about. I am trying to help out with that, so I thought I would start off this article by discussing the Kobolds and Trolls.





The latest update to the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm beta client added support for the new 10-player dungeons, and the new 10-player raids. In this article, we're taking a look at the 10-player dungeons.



&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

10-Player Dungeons

The first thing that is obvious is that the game is now 10-player, and that means the game is now 10-player. As a result, players will be able to select any difficulty they want to play. If you are a hardcore player, you may not want to do that, but if you are a casual player, you can still play with the friends you already have. 

The two new 10-player dungeons are:

The Black Temple - The Black Temple is a PvP-focused dungeon with a single 10-player dungeon with the option to queue for 10-player mode. 

The Grom'gar Keep - The Grom'gar Keep is a PvP-focused dungeon with a single 10-player dungeon with the option to queue for 10-player mode. 

There are only two dungeons in the Cataclysm expansion that are not 10-player. You can see the full list of 10-player dungeons on the official website 





The first part of this year's BlizzCon® in Anaheim, California, is here!

We’re bringing the show back to the Anaheim Convention Center this year, and we’d like to invite you to join us for a great time of year—and to join us for a great time of year.

If you’re in the area and have any questions, please let us know in the comments of this news release. If you’re attending BlizzCon, we’ll be happy to take a look at your tickets.

Healers can't heal at the moment, but are going to keep an eye on the situation. Source

I've seen a lot of players on the forums go on a rant about the healing mechanics. I'm not sure I understand the point of the comment, but I'm also not sure what the intent of the comment was. Source 

Champion's Call
I'm not sure how the mechanic works, but it's an interesting idea. Source 

How about I heal a raid and I give the healers a chance to heal a random player?
You could probably do that. Source 

What if I heal a raid and the healers have to swap out?
That's a nice mechanic. It's a little hard to get your hands on a nice mechanic. Source 

Why is a heal that is a healer always going to be better than a heal that is a rogue?
We like to give classes a lot of variety, but it's difficult to do that with the way the mechanics work. Source 

If healers were balanced like tanks, would all healers be better than rogues?
That's a very interesting concept. It's something we're going to keep an eye on. Source 

The problem is that healers don't get to choose their spec and don't have any other options.
We're trying to find ways to make healers more viable. Source 

How do you feel a tank is going to play in an 8/8 healer rotation? It seems to me they're more focused on tanks.
We think tanks can be a little different in a lot of ways. Source 

A lot of healers think they're the only ones who can heal. They're wrong. They're not the only ones.
We don't think they're the only ones. We think you can do a lot of different things in a tank. Source 

I'm curious what would happen if healers were a 4/4 healer rotation.
I think it would be interesting. It's an interesting idea. Source 

Can you explain how to fix the healing in the encounter? It seems to me the tank just doesn't do enough damage.
The problem is that healers don't get to choose their spec and don't have any other options. Source 

Would a rogue tank be a better tank?
You could argue that there are other tanks that do a lot of damage, but there are also other tanks that are really good at tanking. Source 

I'm curious if you think druids can do a lot of tanking in a raid.
They can. I think there are a lot of druids that want to do more damage in a raid. Source 

I've heard the tanking meta is getting out of control. I'm thinking of changing it.
It's hard to change it. There's a lot of changes to be made, but that's a long process. Source 

You don't think the tanking meta is a problem? If you're a healer, how can we make it less so?
I think it's a problem. I think there are a lot of healers that would like to do more damage in a raid. Source 

Is it the case that you're trying to keep healers as unique as possible in WoW?
I think there's a lot of players that want to do more damage in a raid, and that's cool. Source 

What about melee DPS? What about Protection DPS?
I think it's a challenge for us to keep tanking cool. We want to make sure there are options. Source 

So I'm thinking of maybe making the tanking talent more interesting in the future?
That's a great idea. I think it would be a lot of fun to do that. Source 

Can you talk a little bit about the way healing is going to be handled in the next major content patch?
I think we have some work to do. The raid buff system is going to be a big part of that. Source 

It sounds like the healers are going to be really important to the future of WoW.
I think the players who are interested in raiding want to be able to raid. I think that's a good thing. Source 

I've been playing a warrior for about 3 years. I think you're a good example.
I think the current healing system is a little weak. It's hard for us to get that balance right. Source 

Can you tell us a little bit about how the new one works? Will it be similar to the current system?
It'll be a lot of different systems. It's not the same system. Source

I'm not sure why you think it's the 'right' thing to do in PvP, but I am very interested in your thoughts on this one.
It's not a bug, it's just something we have to take into account when designing abilities for PvP. Celestalon 

any thoughts on having the new PvP gear cost the same as the old PvP gear? 
It's a trade-off, but it's something we think the community would be interested in. Celestalon 

Can you explain how you guys feel that PvP gear is 'worth it' to a non-player?
I think the way PvP gear is valued is a big part of why we think PvP is such a fun game. Celestalon 

Is it the same for PvE and PvP gear?
It's worth it to PvE gear. Celestalon 

Any plans to introduce any kind of PvP gear rewards to the new PvP gear?
We're interested in the idea, but it's not something we're sure we'd like to do. Celestalon

Would you guys like to see PvP gear be equalized or make it a non-factor?
We'd like to make PvP gear equal for PvP and PvE. Celestalon 

PvP gear is a little outdated. Why not make it equal for PvE gear?
It's a good thing to have in PvP gear. It's a bad thing to have in PvE gear. Celestalon

Yes. Celestalon 

How will PvP gear be affected by the nerf? It was always equal in PvP.

We have been doing this for years, and it's been working out great for us. We're not doing it for WoD, but we're definitely trying to keep it in mind when deciding when to do it.

I think a lot of players are curious what the Lich King was like in the past, but I think that's a little bit of a different thing. The story of the Lich King is a lot of fun to tell. Source 

What about the Garrosh encounter? I think the concept of a 'Garrosh' is a bit over the top. It was a very big change to the Lich King, but it's still a pretty cool encounter. Source

Can you explain what happened to the Fel Flame nerf? I don't know the spell that's being nerfed.
The Fel Flame was a buff to the Discipline and Shadow specialization. It was removed because it wasn't very fun to play. Source 

Any idea what's the reasoning behind the nerf to the Breach Talent? It was nerfed because it was the only talent that really did anything.
The talent wasn't really fun to play, and was nerfed because it was overpowered. Source 

I'm confused about the nerf to Shadow's Arcane Shot. I think it was nerfed because it was too powerful. Source

We don't think that's a problem. We don't think we need to be concerned about the fact that there's not enough gear to buy or to get to the end of the season.

In general, we don't think players should be forced to spend their time in PvP for gear. I can see that some players are concerned about this, but I think that's a pretty good discussion to have. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums

It's an interesting conversation, but it's hard to know how much it has to do with how you're trying to work as a team, and how much it has to do with how the game is.
I think it's a great conversation and I think the team is trying to find that balance. Celestalon 

As you have noted, the healers in the raid are doing too much healing, and the healing in the raid is too low. Is there anything that can be done to get the raid back to being close to the ideal?
We're trying to find that balance. It’s hard to tell what the ideal is. We’re not perfect, but I think we have the ability to find that balance. Celestalon 

It seems to me that the nerf to healing in 5.4 is a deliberate one, to make the raid feel more punishing.
The raid nerf was part of the tuning process. Celestalon 






why not nerf Feral Shaman's taming in 10% dps to compensate for the lack of taming talent?

In a recent blog post, I mentioned that the next major content patch is going to be the first in a series of content patches we are working on. I also mentioned that we have a lot of exciting things in the pipeline, and I have to admit that the new expansion has gotten me thinking about how the game has evolved since then.

I'm also thinking about the future of WoW. I don't want to go into any detail about what that means, but I do want to take a moment to share a few thoughts that I have been having since the release of Cataclysm.

Cataclysm was a game that was built with the idea that the game would be an online game. It was an idea that we had to be able to bring to the world, and it was an idea that we had to be able to bring to the game. The first expansion, Wrath of the Lich King, was the first expansion that showed us that this was a possibility. The second expansion, Cataclysm, was the second expansion that showed us that the game was an online game. The third expansion, Mists of Pandaria, was the third expansion that showed us that the game was an online game.

I'm not going to go into the specifics of what the next expansion is going to be, but I do want to make a few points. First, we are continuing to work on making the game better. As the game continues to evolve, it's important for players to have the tools they need to keep playing the game, but at the same time, they are also worried about the game's future. The new expansion is a great opportunity for us to take a step back and look at the past, and to see what we could have done to make the game better.

Second, we have a lot of new ideas for the game. We're excited to share them with you, but we also have a lot of ideas for the game that we're working on right now. The new expansion is a great opportunity to go back and see what we can do to improve the game.

Third, we are looking to bring more of our own ideas to the game. We're always looking for ways to improve the game, and we hope you'll join us in this effort.

Fourth, the game has changed a lot over the years. We're always looking for ways to improve the game, and we're looking forward to sharing those ideas with you.

Fifth, I'm sure there are a lot of great ideas for the game, and it's not going to be easy. We're just here to share the cool stuff, and hopefully we can help you have a good time with the game.

And now, I'm just going to share a couple of my thoughts on how we have evolved the game over the years.

The game is very different than it was when we started the development of the game. We have a lot of great ideas and we've always been working on them, but I'm just going to share a couple of examples that show that the game is evolving a lot more than it was.

First, we introduced the concept of player versus player, and we added the idea of questing to the game. We also introduced the concept of questing, and we introduced the concept of the quests system, and we added the concept of leveling up, and we added the concept of PvP. We added the concept of quests, and we added the concept of PvP, and we added the concept of the item system. We also added the concept of reputation, and we added the concept of gold, and we added the concept of reputation, and we added the concept of the guild system. We added the concept of the item system, and we added the concept of the quests system. We also added the concept of the quest system, and we added the concept of the guild system.

We also introduced the concept of the auction house, and we added the concept of the auction house. We also added the concept of the guild system, and we added the concept of the dungeons system. We also added the concept of the item system, and we added the concept of the PvP system. We also added the concept of the dungeons system, and we added the concept of the PvP system. We also added the concept of the PvP system, and we added the concept of the PvP system. We also added the concept of the quest system, and we added the concept of the PvP system. We also added the concept of the dungeon system, and we added the concept of the PvP system.

I'm sure that the game has evolved over the years, but we are still here and we are still working on making the game better.

The new expansion is the first one that shows us that we are moving the game forward.

We have a lot of cool ideas for the game, and I can't really share anything, but I can tell you that the game

Blizzard has some very interesting things in store for the new expansion. They are working on a new way to track the number of players that have purchased a zone or a zone from a given realm. 

While the new system will only work for the current expansion, it's being designed to work on future content, such as World of Warcraft: Legion. It's still a work in progress, so there is a lot of work to be done before we can see it in game. 

In the meantime, the new system will work for all the current expansions.

Q: What do you think is the biggest challenge for a character in the early stages of a level 90 character?

A: We don't have any specific examples to share just yet, but we would like to share some of the reasons why we feel that certain skills and talents are less popular than others.

For example, talent specialization is a big part of the reason why we're not doing a &quot;holy paladin&quot; spec. We like to keep it as a choice, but we think it makes the game feel more like a lot of &quot;holy paladin&quot; players are still going to want to do the class. The class specialization system we're working on is a big part of that, and we like the way it feels. It's a cool idea, but it's one that we're not sure we're ready to commit to.

We do like the idea of specialization. It's an interesting idea, but it's one that doesn't fit the gameplay we want to have. It's something that we're constantly looking at, but it's one that isn't as easy as just throwing in a bunch of talents. We have some ideas that are coming up for how we'd like to make that happen, but they're not finished, and we're still working on it.

Q: What do you think is the biggest challenge for a class in a raid?

A: We like the idea of the tanking class, and we think it's a cool concept. It's not a problem we're solving, but we are working on it.

      HOLY CHANGES
      
      We made several changes for Holy, to go along with other larger system changes to compensate for the removal of [Divine Favor], [Divine Shield], and [Divine Fury]. We also needed to replace some cooldowns with new ones, so we took a look at cooldowns that were broken because of Divine Favor and Divine Shield, and considered adding a new one to the mix. We decided to replace Divine Fury with [Divine Guidance], which is less clear cut. We also needed to update some cooldowns to better align with the new system, since they were broken because of Divine Favor and Divine Shield. Holy now has several cooldowns that were redundant and did not use [Divine Fury]. We also needed to update some stances to better support the new system, since they were not used consistently and were therefore removed.

Many of the changes to mana were made for the warrior and druid class, and for warrior and druid, in the Talent Order: Warrior vs. Druid. Mage. For mages, we made several changes specific to them, and to many other classes.

      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Monk ability consolidation is fairly straightforward. It includes merging of some passive abilities, and removal of others.

      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Monks had a few mergers of passive abilities. But overall the intent of most of them is to make them more versatile.
      
      
      One important distinction between Monks and Warriors is that Warriors have weapons, while Monks have mind-blades. That distinction will play a role in deciding which abilities to use and when to use them, but it's not directly related to the difference in attack power. Another important distinction is that Monks use their blades in combat, while Warriors use their swords in passive, defensive modes. In other words, Warriors use their blades in passive modes, while Monks use their blades primarily in offensive modes.
      
      
      Another distinction that will play a role in determining which abilities to use and when to use them is the difference in cooldowns. Generally speaking, the higher the cooldown, the more damage that ability does. So, a Monk using a higher cooldown would do more damage, while a lower cooldown would do more damage with higher attack power.
      
      
      Another distinction that will play a role in

      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      The biggest change here is the merger of Stance of the Fierce Tiger and Stance of the Fierce Tiger monk specializations.

====================
For nearly two years, the two organizations representing Falkland Islanders have sat down together in the capital city, at the historic Town Hall, to hammer out a long-overdue settlement: the Faroe Islands.
   
   
 * This site was named for a region in the South Seas, off the coast of Freetown. The Faroe Islands is now officially a part of the Faroe Islands.
 * The Faroe Islands is now home to a new, independent government led by a group of brave men who have taken refuge in the Town Hall.
 * The Town Hall, as it exists on the Faroe Islands, is under siege from an unknown enemy. The Fortress of Stone has been added to the mix of defensive measures.
 * Stonehearth, the new level 80 quest line will be offered to players who are exalted with the Faroe Islands. However, the power of Stonehearth will only be available for players who are not exalted with the Faroe Islands. This means that players who are not exalted with the Faroe Islands will be able to travel to Stonehearth, and those who are exalted with the Faroe Islands will only be able to visit Stonehearth. This will be addressed through a future patch.
   
   
 * Players will no longer be able to fly or use Flying mount abilities from outside the game. In the mean time, players who use Flying mount abilities from within the game will be forced to learn the corresponding flying mount ability from the trainer.
 * The Faroe Islands has been given a name: Stonehearth.
 * Stonehearth is the official name for the Stonehearth faction located in the South Seas.
 * Stonehearth is led by Captain Galvangar.
 * Stonehearth is represented in the Alliance capital by General Vandis.
 * Players will no longer be able to build or purchase buildings unless they join the Faroe Islands faction.
 * The name of the Stonehearth faction currently resides in the Krasarang Wilds. The faction will eventually be changed to Stonehearth.
 * The Stonehearth faction will eventually be changed to Stonehearth if enough players object to the current faction name.
 * The current Stonehearth faction is actually the Second Sight faction. The Second Sight faction was formed when the original faction, Stormcry, reverted to being a healing faction. Therefore, the current Stonehearth faction is not necessarily a part of the &quot;Stonehearth&quot; family.
 * The current Stonehearth faction is not associated with the Stormcry faction at all.
 * The current Stonehearth faction is not associated with any of the major powers in Alterac Valley. Alterac Valley is being redesigned for this reason.
 * The current Stonehearth faction is not associated with the Horde or Alliance either. They are all independent factions with their own storylines. Alterac Valley is being redesigned for this reason.
 * The current Stonehearth faction is not associated with the Scarlet Monastery either. They are all separate from each other.
 * The current Stonehearth faction is not associated with the Ursine Monastery either. They are all separate from each other.
 * The current Stonehearth faction is &quot;Not Found&quot; meaning they have not been unlocked.
 * A faction will be unlocked and immediately removed by a quest. The nearest available faction is the one closest to your faction's name.
 * Quest givers will be notified when a player obtains a quest that will lead to a faction higher up the quest chain. The givers will have a 3 minute cooldown before they will allow players to complete a quest for which they have not been notified.
 * Non-combat pets are now flagged as Humanoid so they can be tapped and pulled towards a player's minimap.
 * A new option has been added under Video Options called Combat Mouse. This mouse option can be accessed by clicking on the Combat Mouse option in the Video Options menu.
 * A new option, Mouse Click to Move, has been added which disables mouse movement.

 * New art textures have been added for players and mounts.

 * A new feature has been added which allows players to make profession-specific emotes. Emojis can be made using the Emote Builder.
 * A new feature has been added which allows players to make profession-specific emotes more visible. Emotes can be made using the Make Emote ( ) and Set Emote ( ) action buttons.
 * A new feature has been added which allows players to create new emotes more quickly. Emotes can be created with the Add Emote Action Button.
 * A new action bar has been added to the Job Hunter UI which will display

      HORDE CHANGES
      
       * Players can no longer accept Horde invites to Horde Dungeons, and we have banned players from entering Horde dungeons (via the Dungeon Finder) in order to improve the experience for everyone involved. It's been a long time coming, but we're finally making some changes.
      
      
       * Horde Dungeons: The rewards have been modified to be more in line with our goals for a PvP experience: Low level, high resource investment. Combat Potency is a bonus passive ability granted by tanks and healers that gives players an advantage in the PvP environment.
       *  [Oil of Immolation]: This item was never intended to be a part of the armor set. We have adjusted the tooltip on this item to better explain its function and how it affects the attack power contribution from tanks.
      
      MAGE
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
       [Arcane Potency] passive is now a passive effect learned by mages at level 10.

       *  [Arcane Explosion]: The buff from this ability has been modified to work similar to a warrior talent called &quot;Might of the Frozen Wastes&quot;. In addition, Arcane Explosion can no longer trigger &quot;Might of the Frozen Wastes&quot;.
       *  [Arcane Missiles]: Some missiles in the game which spent a percentage of their total mana cost on a direct damage component were replaced with a percentage of their total mana cost as a direct damage component. We made that change to reduce the direct damage component and improve the efficiency of our mana regeneration effects.
       *  [Arcane Explosion]: The damage over time component has been removed and will work in a similar manner to a warrior ability called &quot;Might of the Frozen Wastes&quot;. In addition, Arcane Explosion can no longer trigger &quot;Might of the Frozen Wastes&quot;.
       *  [Arcane Barrage]: Damage over time will no longer cause this ability to trigger and consume up to an additional charge from the Arcane Explosion talent.

       *  [Arcane Explosion]: This ability now shares a cooldown with all other mana cost effects.

       *  [Arcane Torrent]: This ability can now trigger while the mage is sitting.

      ABILITY PRUNING

      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      There were several mergers of passive abilities. There was also a need for additional cooldowns to be placed on abilities. One of the biggest issues with warrior abilities was that they were all stacked together in your mana pool making it difficult to resetting. We've reduced the mana cost of several abilities to try to split up the abilities into smaller scripts.

      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Some of the passive abilities of priests had redundant components, causing them to be unwieldy. We made several changes to consolidate some of these abilities. Our first change was to reduce the number of priest spell buttons. We did this by merging some of their buttons into their baseline abilities. For [Mind Blast], [Mind Flay], and [Penance], we merged their cooldowns into their effects. For [Divine Fury], [Divine Plea], and [Divine Protection], we merged their button activations with their damage absorption. For [Force of Will], we merged their activation with their damage absorption.

      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For rogues, a couple of abilities were changed to make them more usable. For a closer look at the class abilities pruned, check out this blog: https://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=369&amp;sid=1
      
      
      Also worth noting here is the removal of [Blind] from the game. Blind players have always been removed from the game due to durability, and that continued with the patch. We removed durability and buffed damage with abilities to try and encourage players to use them.
      
      
      Finally, we removed the [Elixir of Water] from the game. We felt that the elixir was a necessary evil, and so it was removed. Players complained about the elixir's placement in the game, and so we decided to remove it. Players will now have to find the elixir to gain its benefit, and so we decided to place a new item in the Alchemy Lab to compensate.

      HORDE CHANGES
      
      We made several changes for Horde. One was to bring the damage of Treant Protector up to a more reasonable level, to balance it with the damage of the other two main Treant classes (Guardian and Moonkin). The other was to remove the defensive buff that Tiger Stance provided, as it was giving the wrong damage range to both Guardian and Moonkin, and also to fix a bug with its activation where it was not being reapplied correctly. We also needed to resolve a bug where Colossus Smash could miss, due to its non-Guardian nature, and fix a bug where Colossus Shrink could not be activated. Finally, we needed to fix an issue where War Stomp was not generating the intended aggro, due to targeting reticules not matching the intended for the fight.
      
      
       *  [Rend] now generates 16% more threat.
       *  [Incarnation: Tree of Life] now provides 20% more threat.
       *  [Tiger's Lust] is now also triggered by auto-attacks, though it only affects the character that is actually attacking the monster.
       *  [Warlord's Command] now has a 10% chance to activate, was an 8% chance.
      
      
      That brings us to the present. We're very proud of the Guardian and the Moonkin, and we hope that you are as well. However, there are some problems with both the Guardian and the Moonkin that we needed to solve. The most obvious one is that the Moonkin does not have the stamina to fight in full health (they have to eat, drink, and sleep to recover). Additionally, the Moonkin has no arms, so we had to find a way to make them eat and breathe. We solved this problem by having the Moonkin's right arm become the right arm of the Guardian. This solution solved both problems, but it still left the Guardian with one arm. This was a very difficult problem to solve, because the Moonkin already has the right arm, so we knew it would be better to just kill the right arm off. Unfortunately, this solution did not solve the problem, because the problem with eating and breathing was already solved by that point. We decided to kill the right arm off, because we do not have any other options. The problem with eating and breathing is that it is not handled correctly. All of the abilities that deal damage with food and drink are not handled correctly either. This leads to situations where you are sitting, and your character does not move. You are supposed to be able to eat and drink, yet you are not able

====================
The Darkspear Trolls have always been a popular choice for warlocks due to their fast paced and strategic nature. In Patch 7.1.2, the Trolls were replaced with the Gallows Trolls, who hail from the Eastern Plaguelands. The Darkspear Trolls have a long history with the Eastern Plaguelands, and are a proud clan. Their leader, Gallows, is a Troll from the Eastern Plaguelands. Their leader, Warlocks, are also from the Eastern Plaguelands. Both Warlocks and Trolls have a long history with the Eastern Plaguelands, and have always fought for the clan.


In the war against the Demons, the Trolls were extremely helpful in the battle for Hallow's End. Their leader, Gallows, is also the clan warlock known as &quot;the Dragon&quot; due to his mystical powers. After the war against the Demons, Warlocks and Trolls returned to their homeland, where they continue their war against the Horde.


Patch 7.1.2 includes the first playable Warlocks and Trolls, alongside the Gallows Trolls. The Patch 7.1.2 cinematic is narrated by a female Troll.


The Patch 7.1.2 cinematic is considered a pre-release patch, and was written by a player prior to the official announcement. The cinematic highlights the changes with art by Nefarian. The music composed by Jaime Ayala is primarily instrumental. The Patch 7.1.2 cinematic is considered a placeholder for the expansion, and is not part of the official expansion roadmap.

Targeted spells cast by a rogue will now be more likely to be dodged by their target. This is to prevent the player from simply zoning into the area and spamming the dodge key with no regard for the fact that their target will be using that key to dodge the dodge. The rogue has been specially trained in order to avoid using dodge abilities where possible.

The visual for healing from the [Mana Feed] ability has been changed to make it easier to distinguish between the two. Mana Feed: When the Priest casts [Vampiric Touch] on a target, the cast time of [Heal] is added into the equation with the Vampiric Touch heal. This is the primary source of contention between the two talents. The talent [Vampiric Touch] is intended to be used in conjunction with [Contrition] in order to greatly increase the healing of the [Vampiric Touch] talent. Contrition currently does not work with Vampiric Touch.

      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT

      HORDE CHANGES
      
      The biggest change here is probably the biggest change to Warriors in a long time: the ability to ignore tank buffs. Everyone loves a good tank buff, and it's great to have a group of Warriors who share your love for the game. However, in order to make this a reality we needed to change the core gameplay of Warriors. We've always been about adding gameplay depth to the game, so we're happy with the results. However, there are some situations where that gameplay depth comes at the cost of tank DPS.
      
       [Ravager] is a popular tank ability among newer players, so we wanted to expand the game to include more tanks. However, we also needed to make the talent more viable for lower level Tanks. Our goal with Tank Devastation was to remove the ability for lower level Tanks to just sit back and take damage, and we were successful with that. We've lost some of that depth with the changes to [Ravager], but we've gained some new gameplay depth with the changes to [Wrecking Crew].
      
      
      We also needed to change the playstyle of Warrior [Mortal Strike], because [Slam]'s damage has been reduced by 40% and [Riposte]'s damage has been reduced by 30%. We also needed to change the targeting cone of [Mortal Strike], because that mechanic has always been broken down into different categories. So, we changed Armor Sacks to now have a single category (Destructive Ability) and added a new category (Stunting Ability) to Armor Proficiencies. All of those changes apply to Misdirection as well.
      
      
      Another big change for Warriors is the addition of [Blood

TORONTO â€“ Two prominent figures in the Bitcoin community, Charlie Lee and Charlie Liu, have died at the age of 42.
   
   
 *  [Charlie Lee] â€“ A self-taught programmer by trade, Charlie Lee was tragically killed in a car accident in 2014 while biking through his native South Korea. His death sparked an extensive controversy over the legality of riding through residential streets in his native land.
    *  [Charlie Liu] â€“ A self-taught journalist, Charlie Liu was tragically killed in a car crash in 2014 while bicycling through his native Hong Kong. His death sparked an extensive controversy over the legality of using bicycles in urban areas.
   
   
 * Charlie Lee was known for his outspoken criticism of the Chinese government and outspoken opposition to the Silk Road auction.
    *  [Gavin Andresen] â€“ A self-described &quot;hardcore Bitcoiner&quot; by trade, Gavin Andresen was tragically killed in a mysterious plane crash in Malaysia in 2014. Rumors have since circulated that he may have been involved in the crash.
   
   
 *  [Sean Thompson] â€“ A journalist, photographer, and actor best known for his work as the voice of Kota the Storm in the Warcraft movie series, Sean Thompson passed away last week. He was 42 years old.
    *  [Terrence Hudson] â€“ A self-described &quot;geeky legend&quot; who spent most of his career in the gaming industry, Terrence Hudson was tragically killed last week in a plane crash in San Francisco Bay. He was 32 years old.
    *  [Cambridge Astronomer] â€“ A self-described &quot;brilliant young man&quot; who &quot;took astronomy very seriously,&quot; Cambridge Astronomer Cambridge was tragically killed last week in a plane crash in Salt Lake City. He was 22 years old.
    *  [Grizzly Bear] â€“ A legendary Swiss Army knife, the Grizzly Bear was once owned by the titular character from the film series. Unfortunately, its current owner is none other than the film's creator, Stanley Kubrick. Grizzly Bear is considered by many to be one of the most dangerous knives ever made.
    *  [Flask of the Legion] â€“ Created by legendary adventurer and gun collector Galgann, the Flask of the Legion is said to be the key to many a man's purse. Unfortunately, since its owner is none other than the film's narrator, we must now assume that Galgann was indeed the main character in the film.
    *  [Kilgore Mageblade] â€“ Originally crafted by the legendary Spellbinders of the Western Plaguelands, the Kilgore Mageblade has become a treasured possession for the Alliance. The Alliance has expressed their fondness for the item and wish to keep it for their own use. We, however, are not entirely sure what to make of this particular dispute.
    *  [The Black Dagger of the Ogre Magi] was made by an unknown artist, however, it has since been given to the Horde. We believe this individual to be the true inspiration behind the legendary hooded mace.
    *  [The Red Whelp Moth] was created by a player who fell on hard times back in Northrend, so we're putting that name on it's rightful owner.
    * Another piece of memorabilia from the game, this time for the class known as &quot;Murlocs,&quot; has been added to the game. This new item is available through a series of quests and should be in no way related to the &quot;Red Whelp Moth.&quot;

 *  [Tiny Spinning Duplicator] is now a toy.

      BLOOD CHANGES
      
      Blood type was the determining factor on the decisions Blizzard made in
        the course of their recent Resilience work. In order to properly
        balance the number of health and survivability of their damage
        mitigation, we've taken steps to remove that factor from the game. We
        will be making a Major Resolve patch to address this in a major way,
        reducing the number of points spent on Resilience by the same amount and
        merging it with baseline Resilience. As such, the Blood deathrattle we
        are making now has a smaller number of points to compensate for the
        removal of Resilience. The scaling and diminishing returns of those
        changes will continue to be the focus of the discussion of scaling and diminishing
        returns for different stats.
      
      
       * Blood deathrattlers now start with a healthy amount of health, but will burn more
         health per blood point (while in [Resilience]) upon death. This will
         be different for each class, specialization, and tree.
       * Blood deathrattlers will be split into two tiers: The lower tier
         will burn less health per blood point (while in [Blood Protection]) and
         more (while in [Blood Presence).
       * All classes will have more health and rage when [Blood Presence] is active
         (levels 71-80). Both will burn less health per blood point (while
         in [Blood Presence]) and rage (while in [Blood and Brains]) upon
         death.
      
      
       * Death knights now start with roughly 20% of their total health
         (before [Resolve] and [Blood and Brains]) remaining after their [Blood
          Surgency] or [Blood Strike] ability is used. As a general rule,
         all classes will

    armor in a row. Both pieces were promptly thrown out the window .
