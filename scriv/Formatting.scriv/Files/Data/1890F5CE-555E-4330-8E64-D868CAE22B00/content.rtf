\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0        *  [Divine Star]: The amount healed by this spell has been increased to bring it in line with similar abilities.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0        *  [Dream of Cenarius]: This talent now grants its buff on heal over time spells as a chance-on-hit effect instead of a flat heal over time effect. The effect remains unchanged for healing over time spells.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0        *  [Halo Force]: The healing granted from this ability is no longer affected by the damage reduction provided by [Divine Star].}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0        *  [Halo Shield]: This spell can now trigger while the Paladin is standing up. Now grants immunity from all damage while standing. Additionally, the immunity now shares cooldowns.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0        *  [Insanity]: The cooldown reduction this talent provides to Divine Star has been removed. In addition, this talent now provides immunity from all damage while the Paladin is standing up. In addition, now shares cooldowns.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0        *  [Legacy of the Greats]: This talent now provides immunity to roots, stuns and sleep effects. It also increases all healing spells by 20%. Cooldown reduction to [Circle of Healing] absorption is unchanged. The talent now provides immunity to roots and stuns to all Paladins in an active party. The talent now provides haste for Holy and Protection from all other specs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0        *  [Leap of Faith]: Duration and mana cost reduced. This is probably mostly a bug, as the tooltip has been corrected.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0        *  [Prayer of Fortitude]: This spell's effects can now stack. The most recent effect can last as long as the priest has a certain number of prayers (in fact, multiple Priests can have the same effect). Each successive prayer grants progressively more protection, but more often than not, the priest is already maxed out on health and won't take damage from anything. This means, for example, that a paladin that is using Leap of Faith in a raid and trying to maximize their critical strike chance will have less chance to miss when the priest is healed. In addition, the ability can now trigger when a critical heal is dished out or absorbed. Finally, when multiple critical strike heal spells are cast near each other, their effects now stack (i.e. if two Judgement heals are cast across the street, each one will hit the same target, but each will have a different effect on those targets). This change also applies to Judgment, which now hits the same target but spreads more frequently when cast near another target.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0        *  [Sanctified Judgement]: This ability will now grant immunity to the Silence effect.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0        *  [Way of Light]: This talent now provides a constant reduction to all harmful magic effects. It will also now remove [Polymorph] effects, including those in SMM.}
