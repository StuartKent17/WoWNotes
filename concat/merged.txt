CLASSES

 *  [Aspect of the Hawk] now grants roughly 35% more attack power.
 *  [Deterrence] now also reduces damage taken by 30% while active.
 *  [Black Arrow] now ticks every 2 seconds for 20 seconds, as opposed to every
   3 seconds for 15 seconds. The total damage dealt by the ability is unchanged.
 *  [Lock and Load] no longer benefits [Arcane Shot], nor is it consumed by
   Arcane Shot.

 MAGES

 *  [Fireball] damage has been reduced by roughly 6%.
 *  [Pyroblast] damage has been reduced by roughly 6%.

 PALADINS

   that can be dispelled.

 ROGUES

 *  [Adrenaline Rush] no longer triggers a global cooldown.

DUNGEONS & RAIDS

 * You can now form same-faction raids with Real ID friends, allowing you to
   enter Raid Finder in groups larger than 5, run older normal or heroic raids,
   or participate in Battlegrounds. You will not yet be able to run normal or
   heroic Dragon Soul with cross-realm raids of Real ID friends.
 * Several typo fixes and clarified descriptions have been added to the Dungeon
   Journal entries for Dragon Soul.
 * Players no longer benefit from a role-based need bonus on the second of
   multiple copies of the same item on a single Raid Finder boss kill. For

   (and wins the first) will only automatically roll 1-100 for the second from

    * Spine of Deathwing
       * Burning Tendons health has been reduced by 15% in 10- and 25-player
         Heroic mode. This change eases the burst damage requirement to complete
         the encounter, which should allow players to make use of more varied
         raid compositions.
      
      
    * Madness of Deathwing
       * The Priest spell Leap of Faith is no longer usable while under the
         effect of Carrying Winds.
      
      
   
   

ITEMS

 *  [Vial of Shadows] damage (Lightning Strike) has been reduced to
   approximately one-third of previous damage. However, it will now trigger

   [Holy Word: Sanctuary].

    * Warchief Garrosh, obsessed with assuring the Horde's supremacy over 
      Kalimdor, launches an all-out attack against Jaina's island home of 
      Theramore. Though valiant Alliance defenders rush to repel the sudden
      onslaught, they’ll soon find themselves unprepared for the terrible scope
      of Garrosh's true plans…
    * This Scenario will become available for level 85 characters for the week

      for which you have loot rights.

      from a select pool of realms.
    * When a player is in a zone that is set as a "cross-realm zone", in
      addition to seeing other players from their native realm, they'll also
      seamlessly see (and be able to play with) players from other realms.
    * Players will always be able to group and quest as they normally would with
      players from their native realm.
    * This functionality will be enabled for a limited number of realms at
      first, and will be granted to additional realms as we near the release of
      Mists of Pandaria.

    *  GENERAL
      
       * The Pandaren Campaign begins! 
          * The conflict between the Horde and the Alliance has ignited a new
            series of daily quests along the shore of the Krasarang Wilds.
          * Players can visit their faction strongholds in the Vale of Eternal
            Blossoms to begin the quest to summon their war fleets to the
            continent of Pandaria.
          * Players will both valiantly defend their faction's outpost and
            assault the opposing faction's headquarters.
          * Two new Reputations have been added: Alliance players can earn
            reputation with Operation: Shieldwall, while Horde players will
            curry favor with the Dominance Offensive.
          * Players can follow the story of the Pandaren Campaign through a
            series of special quests tied to their reputation with the landing
            forces. Heroes assisting with the war effort will join key
            characters and faction leaders as the growing conflagration spreads
            across Pandaria... as well as other locations around Azeroth.
          * Players can slay rival NPCs and opposing faction players along the
            shore to earn commissions that can be spent to upgrade their
            faction's base.
          * Look for strategic objectives to capture, including graveyards and
            towers. Commissions can be spent to recruit guards that will help
            protect this captured territory!
          * Players who are truly dedicated to their faction can spend their
            commissions on an item that will give their fellows an extra
            reputation group quest for the day. Horde players can speak with 
            Ongrom Black Tooth, while Alliance players can contact Proveditor
            Grantley for details.
         
         
       * Item Level Upgrades 
          * Players can now use PvE and PvP currencies to directly upgrade
            equipment by visiting Ethereal merchants in their respective
            Pandaria faction capitals.
          * Weapons and armor of item level 458 or higher can be improved by up
            to 8 item levels each.

            for 8 item levels, while Epic quality PvE gear costs 750 [Valor
            Points] for 4 item levels and can be upgraded twice.
          * Rare quality PvP gear costs 1500 [Honor Points] to upgrade once for
            8 item levels, while Epic quality PvP gear costs 750 [Conquest
            Points] for 4 item levels and can be upgraded twice.
          * Be aware that items that have received item level enhancements
            cannot be placed into Void Storage.
         
         
       * Legendary Quest 
          * Wrathion has taken a keen interest in the events along the coast of
            the Krasarang Wilds. Those that have aided the Black Prince in the
            past will now have new quests to complete as they advance Wrathion's
            agenda for Pandaria and their own progress toward Legendary power.
         
         
       * Brawler's Guild 
          * Underground fighting rings have sprung up in Stormwind and Orgrimmar 
            that will give brawlers who have their mitts on an invitation a
            chance to earn bragging rights by testing their solo PvE mettle
            against some of the toughest creatures found in World of Warcraft.
          * Players will prove their skill, and increase their rank with the
            Brawler's Guild, as they win matches against some of the most
            difficult solo encounters in World of Warcraft.
          * Entry into the brawler’s guild is by invitation only. Invitations
            can be found on the black market auction house, by invitation from
            somebody within the guild, and occasionally as drops from certain
            Horde and Alliance NPCs.
          * As their Brawler's Guild rank increases, players will unlock
            additional rewards and activities within the Brawler’s Guild.
          * Brawlers on a realm will gather together into the blood spattered
            ring to watch as their peers face down their own opponents. They can
            watch the battles in progress to learn from hardened Brawler's Guild
            veterans as they wait for their own turn to fight.
          * If this is your first night at Brawler's Guild, you have to fight.

         recorded in the currency tab of the Character Sheet.
       * Grand Commendations are now available for purchase from all Mists of
         Pandaria faction vendors at Revered reputation. Using a Grand
         Commendation will permanently increase the amount of reputation gained
         with that faction across all characters on a Battle.net account.
       * Timezones are now standardized for all North American World of Warcraft
         realms. Reset times for professions, holiday events, daily quests, etc.
         now happen at the same time regardless of realm time. Raid and Heroic
         Dungeon reset times remain unaffected. Read more here.

         up to 9 times.
       *  [Bestial Wrath] no longer grants Hunter pets immunity to crowd control 
         effects, and instead now breaks existing crowd control effects when
         activated.
       * Glyphs 
          * The [Glyph of Icy Solace] has been renamed to [Glyph of Solace], and
            now causes both [Scatter Shot] and [Freezing Trap] to remove all
            damage over time effects from the target.
          *  [Glyph of Scattering] has been removed.

         now dealt over 3 seconds. This damage over time behaves in a manner

      PET BATTLES
      
       * A new item has been introduced that can be used to upgrade the quality
         of Battle Pets: Battle-stones. 
          * Battle-stones are available in two basic types, general purpose
            Battle-stones that can be used to upgrade the quality of any pet,
            and family specific Battle-stones, which can only be used to upgrade
            pets of a specific pet family. Pets over level 15 upgraded in this
            way can lose up to two levels in the process.
          * Battle-stones are available in two qualities: Flawless Battle-stones
            can upgrade pets directly to Rare quality, while Polished
            Battle-stones will upgrade a pet to Uncommon quality.
          * Players will have a very small chance to obtain a general purpose
            and family specific Flawless Battle-stone after winning a match
            against wild pets; defeating higher level opponents increases the
            chances of obtaining a stone. Family specific Flawless-Battlestones
            will be of the same family as the pets that were defeated. These
            valuable items are not soulbound, and can be sold on the Auction
            House.
          * Family specific Flawless Battle-stones can be found in the [Sack of
            Pet Supplies] obtained from performing Pet Trainer quests, and are 
            Bind on Pickup.
          * General purpose Polished Battle-stones can be purchased for 1000 
            [Justice Points].
         
         
       * Pet Journal 
          * The quality of each pet is now visible in its slot in the Pet
            Journal.
          * Pets can now be filtered by name, type, rarity and level, and
            filters will remain in place each time the Pet Journal is viewed.
          * It is now possible to search locations in the Pet Journal. For
            example, searching “Westfall” will display all the Battle Pets that
            can be found in Westfall.

         portraits, names and tooltips.
       * The level of battle pets in a zone can now be seen on the map, and it's

         remaining duration of these effects.
       * The experience multiplier obtained by all seven Grand Master pet
         trainers in Pandaria has been increased to x5 from x3.5.
       * The experience multiplier obtained by defeating Pet Trainers Julia
         Stevens, Old MacDonald, Zunta, and Dagra the Fierce has been reduced to
         x2.5 from x3.5.
       * Macros have been added that allow for summoning random pets and random
         favorite pets.

         wild.

         Chosen. The reward for this achievement is 3000 gold.
       * Players that defeat Aki the Chosen at the culmination of the Battle Pet
         quest lines can now follow a new line of Battle Pet quests and
         associated daily quests that allows players to battle against Pandaren
         spirits.
       * A new Master Pet Tamer offering daily quests has been added to the 
         Darkmoon Faire. Completing quests for the new trainer will offer the
         chance to acquire a new pet: the [Darkmoon Eye].
       * The [Dragon Kite] can now be used in Pet Battles.
       * The [Imperial Silkworm] and [Imperial Moth] pets can now be created by

       * Two new Battle Pets now roam Darkmoon Island waiting to be caught.

            on Pandaria. Barnaby Fletcher will occasionally visit Halfhill
            Market to peddle a new type of seed – and take advantage of the 
            Tillers’ hospitality.
          * Portal Shards grow into consumable items which can be used to open a
            portal from Sunsong Ranch to a major faction city.
         
         
       * Seeds now stack to 50.

         instead, they have a chance to find special seeds such as Magebulb,
         Enigma Seed, Songbell, and more.
      
      RAIDS, DUNGEONS AND SCENARIOS
      
       * The Raid Finder system will no longer provide a notification regarding
         how many bosses have been defeated in an instance. Players that join
         and complete a partially cleared raid will be given preference for a
         fresh instance when they next queue.
       * Joining and then quickly leaving a partially cleared Raid Finder raid
         will give a deserter debuff, restricting re-queuing for 30 minutes.

          * Viscidus in the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj
          * Razorgore the Untamed in Blackwing Lair

          * Scenarios now include Dungeon Finder queue features, including
            leaders, backfill, vote to kick, and deserter debuffs. Roles are
            still not required.
         
         
      
      PVP
      
       * The growing conflict between the Horde and the Alliance has spilled
         across the face of Azeroth: level 90 players can now queue for

         these epic conflicts.
       * PvP Power will now only increase the healing of dedicated healing
         specializations, and will now only increase the damage of dedicated
         damage or tanking specializations.
       * The amount of PvP Power on weapons has been increased.
       * Arena matches now have a 25 minute time limit (was 45 minutes).

       * Fishing 
          * The Stranglethorn Vale Fishing Extravaganza has returned every
            Sunday, but now allows three winners per tournament. It also offers
            competitors a chance to earn the rewards once offered by the Kalu’ak
            Fishing Derby.
          * Speckled Tastyfish fishing pools no longer spawn during the
            tournament. Instead, Tastyfish can be caught from any fishing node
            in all parts of Stranglethorn Vale while the tournament is active.

         signified by new minimap icons.
       * A new banner will appear when a player is subjected to an effect that

         “Interface Options" menu.

            Doom], [Ultimatum], [Scent of Blood], [Crimson Scourge], and [Sudden

             * The snare provided by [Ice Trap] is now more responsive when

             *  [Lock and Load] will now activate correctly when Ice Trap is
               triggered by an immune target, as long as a susceptible target is
               within the area of effect.
             * Fixed several issues involving [Trap Mastery], [Entrapment], 
               [Glyph of Black Ice], and [Glyph of Ice Trap].

               match the increased area of effect provided by the glyph.
            
            
          * Mages

    *  GENERAL
      NEW DAILY QUEST HUB: ISLE OF THUNDER
      
       * Here players can join the assault to conquer the Thunder King's island
         stronghold, unlock new questlines and daily quest hubs, participate in
         special events, earn the right to visit the fabled Treasure Room, lay
         claim to an arsenal of powerful mogu artifacts for their faction, and
         more.
       * Each faction's finest are spearheading the assault: the Kirin Tor
         Offensive led by Jaina Proudmoore and the Sunreaver Onslaught led by 
         Lor'themar Theron. Earning reputation with these new factions offers
         heroes the opportunity to receive new quests and reputation rewards,
         including powerful items and an intimidating new mount.
       * After both the Alliance and the Horde have eked out a foothold on the
         isle, players can choose to perform quests that are PvE or PvP focused.
         PvP quests will direct players against opposing faction NPCs, but
         slaying opposing players will grant credit as well.
       * As the heroes conquer the Isle, they will unlock the powerful Thunder
         Forge, which will allow Blacksmiths to forge mighty raid-worthy items,
         as well as classic weapons from the past.
       * Heroes can join the war effort and find transportation to Isle of
         Thunder by visiting the Shado-Pan Garrison in Townlong Steppes on the
         western shores of Pandaria. The Isle of Thunder will be unlocked
         progressively, based on each realms' participation in the war effort;
         initially only some of the Isle's features will be unlocked. Future
         unlocked content will include the Stormsea Landing and the outdoor raid
         boss, Nalak, the Storm Lord.
       * Heroes fortunate enough to acquire a " [Key to the Palace of Lei Shen]"
         can bring it to the Shado-Pan on the Isle of Thunder and use it to
         infiltrate the fabled treasure vaults of the first emperor. Heroes are
         tasked with grabbing as much loot as they can within five minutes.
         Larger chests will have the most loot, including special keys that can
         be used at the end of the run for a chance at epic gear and other major
         rewards. Keys are awarded from rare bosses, hidden chests around the
         island, and from award satchels obtained by completing daily quests.
      
      NEW RAID: THRONE OF THUNDER
      
       * Lei Shen, the Thunder King, has returned to wreak his vengeance on

         new raid: Throne of Thunder.
       * Throne of Thunder is a sprawling citadel housing 12 new raid
         encounters, and players that defeat Lei Shen in Heroic mode can earn
         the opportunity to face an additional 13th foe.
       * The Raid Finder version of the Throne of Thunder is divided into 4
         different sections, Last Stand of the Zandalari, Forgotten Depths,
         Halls of Flesh-Shaping, and Pinnacle of Storms.
       * Join the Shado-Pan Assault in their singular drive to see Lei Shen
         defeated once and for all, and gain access to impressive Valor reward
         items. Reputation with this faction can be earned only within the
         Throne of Thunder raid dungeon.
       * Ao Pye at Niuzao Temple in Townlong Steppes is offering to sell 
         Shado-Pan Assault faction gear to adventurers for Valor points. Another
         NPC will also be selling those items in or near the entrance to the
         Throne of Thunder on Isle of Thunder.
      
      THE LEGENDARY QUEST CONTINUES
      
       * Wrathion is determined to know the origin and source of Mogu power, and
         Azeroth's mightiest heroes will aid the Black Prince in finding out
         what it is. The search for information will take players into the
         depths of the Thunder King's Palace, and pit them against trials of
         perseverance and skill. Along the way, they'll unlock the secrets to a
         new legendary metagem, the Crown of the Heavens.
       * Players seeking to re-acquire previous Legendary quest rewards (Such as
         gems for Sha-touched weapons) can now speak with the Blacktalon
         Quartermaster, the surly-looking Pandaren standing in the first floor

            against him.
         
         
       * Oondasta 
          * Found in a place that has been lost in time, the great devilsaur 
            lord Oondasta has been outfitted for battle with weaponry and armor
            by the Zandalari, and awaits players brave enough (or foolhardy
            enough) to seek him out on the mysterious Isle of Giants found in
            the seas north of Kun-Lai Summit.
         
         
      
      TAKING OVER THE FARM
      
       * Players that have grown attached to working the land at Sunsong Ranch 
         can now acquire the farm from Farmer Yoon via a quest. The farmhouse
         becomes a rest point like an Inn, where the player can bind and
         instantly log out. Work orders will pour into the farm from factions
         across Pandaria, and completing a work order will earn a reputation
         boost with the issuing faction.

            require level 50).

       * Fury

       * Protection 
          * The base damage of [Shield Slam] and [Revenge] has been increased by

          *  [Unwavering Sentinel] now improves the damage reduction of

         Zandalari Scouts can be handled by 1 or 2 players, while elite 
         Zandalari Warbringers will likely require a full party of 5 heroes.
         Defeat Warbringers to gain special drops, including crafting materials,
         reputation gains, an achievement, and even the chance to get one of
         three new rare mounts!

       * Level-capped players will now have a chance to earn Lesser Charms of
         Good Fortune after winning a pet battle versus a pet within 5 levels of

      RAIDS, DUNGEONS AND SCENARIOS
      
       * Throne of Thunder raid bosses in Normal and Heroic difficulties have a
         chance of dropping items with the Thunderforged designation.
         Thunderforged items are 6 item levels higher than their Normal or
         Heroic counterparts and will drop more frequently in 25-player raids.
         For a more in-depth look at this change, check out this discussion
         thread.
       * To encourage Raid Finder groups to persevere, each time an Raid Finder
         group wipes on a boss fight all players in the group receives a
         stacking buff that increases health, damage dealt, and healing done by
         5% (up to a maximum of 10 stacks). This buff is cleared once the boss
         has been killed.
       * Satchels obtained via the Raid Finder now have a chance to contain
         additional rewards, including: consumables, Spirits of Harmony, rare
         pets or mounts, and Raid Finder versions of Normal and Heroic

         encounters!
       * You can now earn bonus reputation for your first dungeon and scenario
         of the day. You can select which reputation you choose to champion by
         selecting it from the reputation panel on the character screen. When
         you queue for a dungeon or scenario, the UI will remind you which
         reputation you are championing and allow you to change the reputation
         from there. (You cannot change that reputation once you are in the
         dungeon or scenario.)
       * On Normal and Heroic mode, zone-wide auras have been activated in 
         Mogu'shan Vaults, Heart of Fear, and Terrace of Endless Spring,
         reducing the health and damage of all enemies therein by 10%. A NPC
         near the entrance within each zone explains this, and offers to
         deactivate the buff for the benefit of brave/foolhardy adventurers.
       * All players who have defeated Will of the Emperor, Grand Empress
         Shek'zeer, and/or Sha of Fear prior to the release of Patch 5.2 will

         accomplishments.
       * Elders Lin and Liao in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms now offer Mogu
         Runes of Fate in exchange for Lesser Charms of Good Fortune. Mogu Runes

         Nalak the Storm Lord, and Oondasta.
       * The maximum number of Elder Charms of Good Fortune a character can hold

         Endless Spring.
       * Lorewalker Cho has two new tales to tell: Dagger in the Dark and A
         Little Patience. Though his mystical story-weaving magic (and well, the 
         Dungeon Finder), both Alliance and Horde characters are now able run
         these previously faction-specific Scenarios.
       * Level 90 players that use Dungeon Finder to look for a random Dungeon
         or Scenario will receive additional bonus [Valor Points] upon
         completing specific Dungeons or Scenarios. 
          * Dungeons 
             * Siege of Niuzao Temple: 5 bonus Valor Points
             * Scholomance: 10 bonus Valor Points

          * Scenarios 
             * Brewmoon Festival, Greenstone Village, A Little Patience, and 
               Theramore's Fall: 5 bonus Valor Points.
            
            
         
         
       * Heroic Pandaria dungeons now award 100 [Justice Points] per boss. Gold
         drops for those bosses have also been changed from a static 50 gold to
         a 40-60 gold range. Less gold will drop in groups consisting of fewer
         than 5 players.
       * Scenarios now award 50 Justice Points (was 25).
       * Sunwell Plateau 
          * The Kalecgos encounter in The Sunwell can now be completed by a
            single player.
         
         
      
      PVP
      
       * Season 13 has begun! With the start of the new season, Tyrannical and
         Tyrannical Elite gear are now available for purchase.
       *  [Tyrannical Primal Diamond] is now available for purchase with 
         [Conquest Points]. This new PvP-oriented metagem offers PvP Power and 
         Resilience.
       * Characters who have earned over 27,000 Conquest points during Season 13
         will gain access to new vendors that sell Conquest PvP gear for Honor.
         These vendors can be found near existing Pandaria PvP vendors.
       * Mists of Pandaria Season 12 Malevolent Gladiator's PvP gear can now be
         purchased with [Honor Points] instead of [Conquest Points], including
         weapons.
       * All newly purchased Season 12 Malevolent Gladiator's armor, off-hands
         and shields will have an item level of 476 (was 483). Existing
         Malevolent items are unaffected.
       * Balance, Feral, Windwalker, Retribution, Shadow, Enhancement and 
         Elemental now gain 25% of the bonus healing provided by PvP Power (was

         and no bonus damage, from PvP Power.
       * PvP trinkets that clear loss-of-control effects will now also clear
         these effects from the player's pet as well.
       * For casters and healers, PvP Power is now split evenly between
         main-hand and off-hand in a manner similar to a dual-wield melee class.
         This change is retroactive, affecting Season 12 Malevolent and
         Malevolent Elite items. There should be no net change for any character
         already using a main-hand/off-hand combination.
       * Season 13 caster weapons cost 2250 Conquest Points (was 2500 in Season
         12) and shields/off-hands cost 1250 (was 1000), to reflect the
         increased value of the off-hand slot for classes that use it in this
         manner. This change is not retroactive and applies only to Season 13
         items.
       * Characters that have attained requisite title levels ( [Centurion], 
         [Knight-Captain], [Grand Marshal], [High Warlord], etc.) through the 
         Rated Battleground system will be able to purchase old PVP items
         requiring those titles.
      
      BATTLEGROUNDS
      
       * Players in low-level Battlegrounds will have their effective level
         raised to the maximum level allowed in that Battleground bracket.
         Players' base stats and spells are scaled accordingly, and are treated
         as the same level when determining hits, misses, and critical effect
         chance.
       * Rated Battlegrounds now award Conquest to the losing team based on
         their final score. The losing team can earn up to 200 Conquest Points
         from a very close match.
       * Players can obtain a new title "Khan", by completing the following
         Battleground achievements: [Master of the Battle for Gilneas], [Master
         of Twin Peaks], [Master of Temple of Kotmogu], [Master of Isle of
         Conquest], and [Master of Silvershard Mines].
      
      PROFESSIONS
      
       * Archaeology 
          * Mantid Archaeology has been added. Players will be able to uncover
            common and rare Mantid artifacts.
          * Players can purchase a [Mantid Artifact Sonic Locator] to focus
            exclusively on Mantid digsites.
          * The [Lorewalker's Map] now randomizes all digsites in Pandaria,
            rather than just 1.
          * Updates have been made to the "museum" at the Seat of Knowledge.
         
         
       * Blacksmithing 
          * New raid and PvP blacksmithing plans have been added, and can be
            acquired through daily research of Lightning Steel Ingots.
          * Seasoned Blacksmiths will be able to find a way to create Lightning
            Steel Ingots once their realm has unlocked the Thunder Forges on the 
            Isle of Thunder. These ingots will allow blacksmiths to recreate
            powerful weapons from the past, updated for Mists of Pandaria. These

         same visual effect as Glorious Tyranny, costs a scroll of the base
         enchant, and requires a 2200 rating.

       * To facilitate a more balanced team composition, players now need to
         select a role when queuing up for a Battleground or Rated Battleground.
         Role selection should have no effect on queue times. The matchmaking

         the ratio of healers and non-healers queued.
       * Mid-season catch-up for [Conquest Points] has been added. Players will
         now see their cap on Conquest Points increased by 1000 per week since

      NEW RAID: SIEGE OF ORGRIMMAR
      
       * The tensions stoked by Garrosh Hellscream's arrogance have reached a
         boiling point with the devastation unleashed upon the Vale of Eternal
         Blossoms. Now it's time for leaders of the Alliance and Horde to lay
         siege to Hellscream's capital and topple the ruthless Warchief once and
         for all!

            the Siege of Orgrimmar Raid Schedule.
         
         
      
      NEW FEATURE: FLEXIBLE RAID DIFFICULTY
      
       * This is a new raid difficulty designed for pre-made groups of 10 to 25
         players or any number in between. This means it's possible to have
         raids of 15 or 22 players! Difficulty will adjust automatically based
         on the number of players present with encounters intended to provide a
         challenge roughly between Raid Finder and Normal difficulty.
       * Flexible Raid difficulty requires a pre-made group to join but has no
         minimum item level requirements or role restrictions. Both BattleTag™ 
         and Real ID friends are eligible to participate.
       * Loot quality will be between Raid Finder and Normal difficulty and
         awarded through a personal loot system (similar to Raid Finder). Bonus
         rolls and loot specialization will also be supported.

         gradually increase their limits based on the number of players in

         faction's shrine in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.
       * The Timeless Isle is inhabited by all manner of strange and powerful
         creatures that will test the mettle of solo explorers, but great
         rewards await the brave and skillful: epic loot, bind-to-account gear, 
         Mogu Runes of Fate, pets, mounts, fun toys, and much more.
       * The Isle is filled with secrets and mysteries, many of which
         dynamically become available to explorers. Keep an eye on your minimap
         while on the Isle for information on nearby events!

       * To access the Proving Grounds, speak with an NPC in the Temple of the
         White Tiger in Kun-Lai Summit or a class trainer.
       * Each trial is available in four separate difficulties: Bronze, Silver,
         Gold, and Endless. Harder difficulties include more difficult and
         varied enemies.
       * Endless mode allows you to test your mettle against increasingly
         difficult enemies. Compare your best scores to friends and guildmates!

      NEW FEATURE: CONNECTED REALMS
      
       * Connected Realm is a set of two or more standard realms that have been
         permanently and seamlessly "linked." Players on the same Connected
         Realm will be able to trade, send and receive mail, join the same
         guilds, access a single Auction House, run the same Raids and Dungeons,
         and join other adventurers to complete quests.
       * To make Connected Realm feel seamless, player's home realms won't be
         indicated in the game world. In certain places, such as chat, the
         players' home realms will be displayed next to their name.
       * Learn more about this feature in our Patch 5.4 Feature Preview:
         Connected Realms.
      
      REDESIGNED ARENA SYSTEM
      
       * Players no longer need to create or join an Arena team to compete.
       * Similar to the Rated Battleground system, players in a party of the
         appropriate size (cross-realm groups are supported) may queue for an
         Arena bracket of the same size (2v2, 3v3, or 5v5).
       * Each player will have a personal rating that increase or decrease based
         on victories and defeats against other rated opponents. Opponents will
         be selected based on the average Match Making Rating of the party.
       * Conquest cap, requirements on gear and enchantments will be based on
         the player's personal rating.
       * The Arena ladder will no longer be sorted according to Battlegroup.

         earn titles and mounts.
       * For more details about the change to Arenas, please see the blog
         titled: Patch 5.4 Arena Update.
      
      THE LEGENDARY QUEST CONTINUES
      
       * Wrathion's final quests are now available for dedicated heroes who have
         fought on his behalf throughout the pandaren campaign. He's waiting at
         the Tavern in the Mists in the Veiled Stair.

         celestial cloak to Legendary quality!
       * Only players equipped with a Legendary cloak can reach the Sanctum of
         Ordos atop the Timeless Isle. (This privilege extends account-wide.)
      
      BATTLEFIELD: BARRENS
      
       * Vol'jin and his forces move beyond gathering supplies and into a full
         assault on the Horde capital. As such, the [90W] Battlefield: Barrens 
         weekly quest will no longer be available once the invasion on Orgrimmar
         begins in 5.4.
       * Ravika, the Darkspear Rebellion Quartermaster, will no longer be
         available.
       * Latent Kor'kron armor tokens will no longer drop or be available for

         available as a rare drop from Kor'kron, and other associated creatures
         in Northern Barrens.
      
      CLASSES

         effects of a movement speed buff to move faster than normal run speed.
       * All taunt type abilities now increase all threat generated against the
         target while the taunt is active by 200%.

            threat.
          * Vengeance now grants Attack Power equal to 1.5% of the damage taken,

          * Tanks no longer receive Vengeance from many persistent area damage
            effects (standing in the fire) or from missed attacks (dodging and
            parrying an attack will continue to work as it has before).
          * Vengeance gains from being critically hit have been reduced by 50%.
          * There are now diminishing returns on Vengeance gains while tanking
            multiple targets. Each additional target grants progressively less
            Vengeance.
          * So as not to affect Challenge Mode leader boards, the above
            Vengeance changes will not apply there. For Challenge Modes,
            Vengeance will continue to work as it did in patch 5.3.
         
         
       * Area knockback effects now all share a diminishing return category.
         After a player has been moved by one of these spells, the player will

         [Gorefiend's Grasp], [Glyph of Explosive Trap], [Thunderstorm],

            healed for previously.

         targets all party or raid members within 60 yards and accelerates the
         casting Druid's Rejuvenation effects, causing them to heal and expire

         Rejuvenation.

         Overhealing bonus no longer benefits from [Naturalist] or [Mastery:
         Harmony].
      
      Talents 
       *  [Astral Communion] now defaults to generating Lunar energy towards a
         Lunar Eclipse when used after being resurrected or zoning into a new
         area (used to default to generating Solar energy).
       *  [Dream of Cenarius] has been completely redesigned to reduce
         complexity and increase usability, but maintain the spirit of the
         effects. Benefits now vary by specialization.

            [Eclipse] by 25%.

            Healing Touch increases the damage for the Druid's next two melee
            abilities by 30%.

            Increases the critical strike chance of [Mangle] (Bear) by 10% and
            critical strikes of Mangle (Bear) have a 40% chance to make the next
            Healing Touch or [Rebirth] instant, free, and castable in all forms.
            Instant cast version of Healing Touch now benefits from Attack Power
            instead of Spell Power.
          * Restoration: Causes Wrath to deal 20% more damage and heals a nearby
            friendly target for 100% of the damage done.
         
         
       *  [Force of Nature] 
          * Feral: Treant summoned by the Feral version of this talent now deals
            less melee damage, but will cast [Rake] and [Entangling Roots] on
            their target instead of [Bash].
          * Guardian: Guardian Druids now gain Vengeance when their Treant takes
            damage.
         
         
       *  [Heart of the Wild] when activated, now also provides a 25% bonus to
         healing for Restoration Druids.
       *  [Mass Entanglement] no longer has a limit on the number of targets
         that could be affected, up from 5.
       *  [Nature's Swiftness] is no longer a talent, and is now an ability
         learned by Balance and Restoration Druids at level 30. 
          * New talent: [Ysera's Gift]. Ysera's Gift replaces Nature's
            Swiftness, and heals the Druid for 5% of their maximum health every
            5 seconds. If the Druid is at full health, it will heal the most
            injured friendly target nearby instead.
         
         
       *  [Nature's Vigil] when activated now increases all damage and healing
         done by 12% (up from 10%), and causes single-target healing spells to
         trigger an additional heal on a nearby ally for 25% of the amount
         healed. This is in addition to the existing effect where it damages a
         nearby enemy target for 25% of the healing done.
       *  [Soul of the Forest] has been partially redesigned to make it more
         attractive to Balance, Guardian, and Restoration Druids. 
          * Balance: Wrath, [Starfire], and [Starsurge] casts have a 8% chance
            to cause [Astral Communion] to grant 100 Lunar Power or Solar Power
            instead of activating the next Eclipse.
          * Guardian: Increases Rage generation from Mangle (Bear) by 30%
            instead of an additional 3 Rage, and this talent now also applies to
            the Rage generated by Mangle (Bear) when it triggers [Primal Fury].
          * Restoration: Now causes the Druid to gain 100% haste (up from 75%)
            on their next spell after casting [Swiftmend].

            Regeneration's cost to 50 Rage (down from increasing Rage cost to

            a target other than the Druid.
          *  [Glyph of Lifebloom]'s effect is now baseline and has been replaced
            with Glyph of Efflorescence. 
             *  [Glyph of Efflorescence] increases the healing done by Swiftmend
               by 20%, causes the Efflorescence healing effect to be triggered
               by Wild Mushroom instead of Swiftmend, and lasts as long as the
               Wild Mushroom is active.

    *  INTRODUCTION
      
      The Dark Portal in the Blasted Lands has turned blood red. Hundreds of
      strange-looking orcs are violently pouring into Azeroth, killing
      everything that stands in their path. Nethergarde and Okril’lon have
      already fallen, and while the Horde and the Alliance moved as quickly as
      they could to get reinforcements to their people, they are too late. The
      Iron Horde invasion has begun.
      
      
      In this desperate hour, King Wrynn and Warchief Vol’jin have called upon
      their greatest champions to join the front lines in the Blasted Lands and
      do whatever they can to stop the Iron Horde...before the rest of Azeroth
      falls before them.
      
      
      Prepare yourself. Draenor is waiting.
      
      NEW FEATURES
      NEW CHARACTER MODELS
      
       * Character models for races from the original game (dwarf, gnome, human, 
         night elf, orc, tauren, troll, and undead), and draenei have been
         overhauled with an increase to fidelity and texture resolution; while
         retaining the core look and feel of the originals.
       * Character animations have been updated to have more personality and now
         support expressive facial expressions. Emotes are now more emotive!
       * Some of the new and improved character models can be viewed on our
         website.
       * Barber Shop now provides additional character facial-customization
         options.

         strange-looking orcs are violently pouring into Azeroth, killing
         everything that stands in their path. Nethergarde and Okril'lon have
         already fallen, and while the Horde and the Alliance moved as quickly
         as they could to get reinforcements to their people, they are too late.
         The Iron Horde invasion has begun.
       * Adventurers looking to dislodge the Iron Horde's attempts to establish
         a foothold on Azeroth should visit the Blasted Lands.
       * A specially revamped five-player version of Upper Blackrock Spire is
         available to level-90 characters for a limited time, and sets the stage
         for the coming counterstrike against the Iron Horde.
      
      REVAMPED GROUP FINDER/PREMADE GROUPS

         & Raids and Player vs. Player sections of the now consolidated Group
         Finder pane.

         and accessible to all characters on the account.
       * Want to complete the collection? Like the Mount and Pet Journal, items
         that haven't been unlocked yet will show information on how the item
         can be obtained.

         what type of item it's assigned to.
       * Added a "Clean up Bags" button to automatically sort items in the
         character's inventory, moving all empty slots to one area, and
         automatically sorting items to the correct bag. There's also the option
         to ignore a bag from cleanup.
      
      REAGENT BANK
      
       * A Reagent Bank tab has been added to the Bank providing storage for raw

      Heroic (25)
      
      Mythic (20) BOOSTED CHARACTERS
      
       * Newly Boosted Characters now start on the front lines in the Blasted
         Lands, doing whatever they can to stop the Iron Horde pouring out of
         The Dark Portal and start with a basic set of spells and abilities for
         their class. Characters unlock the rest of their spells and abilities
         by advancing through the Iron Horde Incursion world event in the
         Blasted Lands.
      
      CHARACTER AND CLASS CHANGES
      
      Welcome to a look at character and class changes. We're trying a new patch
      note format, which we hope will help better convey the reasoning for many
      of the changes being made and what they mean for you, while providing more
      background into issues we're trying to solve.
      
      
      Looking for a TL;DR summary of the character and class changes? Here you
      go!
      
      
       * Character stats have been squished into smaller numbers that are easier
         to understand. It's important to understand that this is not a nerf as
         enemies' stats have been squished as well.
       * Balanced functionality of Agility, Strength and Intellect.
       * New secondary stats: Bonus Armor, Multistrike, and Versatility.
       * Hit and Expertise have been removed; they're no longer needed in order
         to reliably land attacks!
       * The pacing of healing has been adjusted to allow for more tactical
         decision-making regarding efficiency and throughput, on both
         single-target and multi-target heals. Passive and auto-targeted healing
         have been reduced in effectiveness in order to emphasize the actions
         and choices of healers.
       * Racial traits have been rebalanced so that all races have similar
         combat performance.
       * All classes have had several abilities pruned, with a focus on
         redundant and less-used abilities to cut down on button and keybind
         bloat.
       * Amount of crowd-control in the game (primarily PvP) has been
         drastically reduced. Many crowd-control abilities have been removed,
         and many diminishing returns categories have been merged together.
       * Several common buffs and debuffs have been merged, or removed, where
         they were redundant.
       * All characters now learn some important Major Glyphs automatically as
         they level up.
       * Toned down the amount of instant healing in the game by giving cast
         times to several instant cast heals.
       * For tanks, Vengeance has been redesigned and renamed Resolve. 
          *  [Resolve] does not increase outgoing damage, but does now increase
            tank self-healing and absorption based on damage taken.
         
         
       * Facing requirements (character positioning) on some prominent abilities
         have been loosened or removed.
       * Reduced mana cost of resurrection spells to make it a little easier to
         recover from a wipe.
       * Professions no longer have combat benefit perks tied to them.
       * A multitude of class-specific changes, things like improved distinction
         between different talent specializations, and new Masteries. Please
         consult class-specific sections below for more information.
      
      STAT SQUISH
      
      Character progression is one of the defining characteristics of a
      role-playing game. Naturally, that means that we're continuously adding
      more power to the game for players to acquire. After 4 expansions and over
      9 years of this growth, we've gotten to a point where the numbers involved
      are no longer easy to grasp. And worse, much of the granularity that's
      available is tied up in tiers of older content from Molten Core to Dragon
      Soul, none of which are really relevant anymore. It's no longer necessary
      for Borean Tundra quest gear to be nearly twice as powerful as Netherstorm 
      quest gear, even though the two zones are only a couple of levels apart.
      
      
      In order to bring things down to an understandable level, we've reduced
      the scale of stats throughout the game, back to as if they continued
      scaling linearly through questing content from levels 1 to 90. This
      applies to creatures, spells, abilities, consumables, gear, other items...
      everything. Your stats and damage have been reduced by a huge amount, but
      so have creatures' health. For example, your [Fireball] that previously
      hit a creature for 450,000 out of its 3,000,000 health (15% of its
      health), may now hit that same creature for 30,000 out of its 200,000
      health (still 15% of its health). In effect, you will still be just as
      powerful, but the numbers that appear will be more easily parsed.
      
      
      It's important to understand that this isn't a nerf, and we have special
      handling in place to preserve players' existing ability to solo old
      content. Players will deal bonus damage against lower-level creatures from
      past expansions, and will take reduced damage from them.
      
      
      We've also removed all base damage on player spells and abilities, and
      adjusted Attack Power or Spell Power scaling as needed, so that all
      specializations will scale at the same rate.
      
      
       * The amount of stats on items has been reduced to be much lower than
         before.
       * Creature stats have been reduced to compensate.
      
      
      We've also streamlined the multitude of various types of Haste % and
      Critical Strike % bonuses.
      
      
       * Spell Haste %, Melee Haste %, and Ranged Haste % have been merged into
         a universal Haste %.
       * Spell Crit %, Melee Crit %, and Ranged Crit % have been merged into a
         universal Crit %.
      
      PRIMARY CHARACTER STATS AND ATTACK POWER
      
      The "primary" stats, Agility, Strength, and Intellect, are foundations of
      a character's power. But they have not been created equally, making it
      difficult to properly balance them against secondary stats. The leading
      reason for this is that Agility and Intellect also provide Critical Strike
      chance, in addition to Attack Power or Spell Power, whereas Strength does
      not. In order to achieve better balance, we've removed the Critical Strike
      chance increase from Agility and Intellect. Still, it felt like
      Agility-based characters should critically strike more often, so we've
      raised those classes' baseline Critical Strike chance to compensate.
      
      
       * Agility no longer provides an increased chance to critically strike
         with melee and ranged attacks or abilities.
       * Intellect no longer provides an increased chance to critically strike
         with spells.
       * The base chance to critically strike is now 5% for all classes. There
         are no longer different chances to critically strike with melee,
         ranged, and spells.
       * There is a new passive, named Critical Strikes, which increases chance
         to critically strike by 10%. 
          * It is learned by all rogues, all hunters, Feral and Guardian druids,
            Brewmaster and Windwalker monks, and Enhancement shaman.
         
         
      
      
      We've consolidated the way that Attack Power and Spell Power function and
      scale, to make those values clearer and correct some scaling issues
      regarding caster weapons relative to physical weapons.
      
      
       * Each point of Agility or Strength now grants 1 Attack Power (down from
         2). All other sources of Attack Power now grant half as much as before.
       * Weapon Damage values on all weapons have been reduced by 50%.
       * Attack Power now increases Weapon Damage at a rate of 1 DPS per 3.5
         Attack Power (up from 1 DPS per 14 Attack Power).
       * Attack Power, Spell Power, or Weapon Damage now affect the entire
         healing or damage throughput of player spells.
      
      
      Active mitigation has worked very well as a tanking model. So, moving
      forward we want to keep the amount of Dodge and Parry on tanks on the low
      side. This helps prevent encounters from causing very spiky damage on
      tanks, which generally isn't much fun. Dodge and Parry gains from Strength
      and Agility are being reduced to help accomplish this. Additionally, items
      in Warlords of Draenor will not have Dodge or Parry on them as a stat.
      Some Dodge and Parry can still be gained through class-specific effects.
      
      
       * The amount of Dodge gained per point of Agility has been reduced by
         25%.
       * The amount of Parry gained per point of Strength has been reduced by
         25%.
      
      ITEMIZATION CHANGES
      
      We're making a number of changes to itemization based on a single
      philosophy: We want to increase the chance that any given item drop is
      useful to someone in your group. To support this philosophy we're making a
      few changes to stats. Most items found in Draenor will work for all
      specializations within a given class, so that you never have to grumble
      when you see, for example, Intellect plate drop in a group that lacks a
      Holy paladin.
      
      
      We're also reducing the number of role-specific stats: Hit and Expertise 
      are gone, as are Dodge and Parry as stats on items, replaced with a single
      tank stat of Bonus Armor. Armor and Spirit will be specific to tanks and
      healers respectively, but all other secondary stats will have universal
      appeal.
      
      
      Because of the magnitude of this change, we're retroactively applying this
      philosophy to items in Mists of Pandaria. After the pre-expansion patch
      you may find that some of your items contribute different stats, but they
      should still be good for your class.
      
      
      New secondary stats added
      
      
       * Bonus Armor: Increases Armor and Attack Power for tanking
         specializations.
       * Multistrike: Grants a chance for spells and abilities to fire up to 2
         additional times, at 30% effectiveness (both damage and healing).
       * Versatility: Increases damage, healing, and absorption done. Reduces
         damage taken.
      
      
      Mists of Pandaria and future items
      
      
       * Dodge and Parry have been replaced with Bonus Armor. If an item had
         both Dodge and Parry on it, it has been replaced with an additional
         useful secondary stat.
       * Head, Chest, Hand, Wrist, Waist, Leg, Feet, Weapon, Shield, and
         Off-hand items that had tanking stats (Dodge, Parry) or healer stats
         (Spirit) have been replaced with a different universally useful
         secondary stat.
      
      
      Warlords of Draenor and future items
      
      
       * Plate Armor pieces will always have Strength and Intellect on it.
       * Mail and Leather Armor pieces will always have Agility and Intellect on
         it.
      
      
      In an effort to reduce the physical mitigation of some classes, we've
      modified the amount of Armor provided by some armor types.
      
      
       * Plate, Mail, and Shields now have less Armor relative to Cloth and
         Leather armor.
      
      HIT AND EXPERTISE REMOVAL
      
      Hit and Expertise were not fun stats. They acted to remove a penalty,
      instead of making you stronger. Most players treated Hit/Expertise caps as
      mandatory (rightfully so), with failure to reach those caps as a trap of
      sorts. After adjusting, gemming, and reforging gear to meet that cap,
      players could then go after the actual damage-increasing stats. We decided
      to remove Hit and Expertise, and make it so you don't need them. We still
      want melee specializations to attack creatures from behind when possible,
      so attacks from the front will have a 3% chance to be parried that cannot
      be eliminated for non-tanking specializations.
      
      
       * General 
          * Hit and Expertise has been removed as a secondary stat.
          * Hit and Expertise bonuses on all items and item enhancements (gems,
            enchants, etc.) have been converted into Critical Strike, Haste, or 
            Mastery.
          * All characters now have a 100% chance to hit, 0% chance to be dodged
            , 3% chance to be parried, and 0% chance for glancing blows, when
            fighting creatures up to 3 levels higher (bosses included).
          * Tanking specializations receive an additional 3% reduction in chance
            to be parried. Tank attacks now have a 0% chance to be parried vs.
            creatures up to 3 levels higher.
          * Creatures that are 4 or more levels higher than the character still
            have a chance to avoid attacks in various ways, to discourage
            fighting enemies that are much stronger.
          * Dual Wielding still imposes a 19% chance to miss, to balance it with
            two-handed weapon use.
         
         
       * Death Knight 
          *  [Veteran of the Third War] now also reduces the chance for attacks
            to be parried by 3%.
         
         
       * Druid 
          *  [Balance of Power] has been removed. A new level-100 talent with
            the same name has been added.
          *  [Nature's Focus] no longer increases the chance to hit with 
            [Moonfire] and [Wrath].
          *  [Thick Hide] now also reduces the chance for attacks to be parried
            by 3%.
         
         
       * Monk 
          *  [Stance of the Wise Serpent] no longer increases Hit or Expertise.
          *  [Stance of the Sturdy Ox] now also reduces the chance for attacks
            to be parried by 3%.
         
         
       * Priest 
          *  [Divine Fury] has been removed.
          *  [Spiritual Precision] has been removed.
         
         
       * Paladin 
          *  [Holy Insight] no longer increases the chance to hit with spells.
          *  [Sanctuary] now also reduces the chance for attacks to be parried
            by 3%.
         
         
       * Shaman 
          *  [Elemental Precision] has been removed.
          *  [Spiritual Insight] no longer increases the chance to hit with 
            [Lightning Bolt], [Lava Burst], [Hex], or [Flame Shock].
         
         
       * Warrior 
          *  [Unwavering Sentinel] now also reduces the chance for attacks to be
            parried by 3%.
         
         
      
      SECONDARY STAT ATTUNEMENTS
      
      A new concept that we're introducing is each specialization having an
      attunement to a particular secondary stat. These take the form of a
      passive ability that grants a 5% increase to the amount of a specific
      secondary stat gained. This provides a good starting point for where to
      focus your secondary stats. Usually, it will be your highest throughput
      stat (not counting Spirit for Healers, and Bonus Armor for Tanks, which is
      an optimal secondary stat in most cases). There are exceptions, and raw
      throughput may not even be the biggest concern in some situations. Treat
      this as a guideline, not a rule, about which secondary stat to favor.
      
      
       * All specializations now receive a 5% bonus to specific secondary stat
         bonuses received from all sources. This bonus is granted through new
         passive abilities or additional effects added to existing passive
         abilities.

      PLAYER HEALTH AND RESILIENCE
      
      We're planning several interconnected changes designed to provide
      better-tuned gameplay for healers and improve the healing dynamic in PvP.
      
      
      The high amount of base Resilience and Battle Fatigue in Mists of Pandaria 
      caused characters to feel much weaker in PvP than they did in PvE. To
      address this disparity, we're approaching Warlords of Draenor with the
      goal of shrinking that gap as much as possible. To reduce dependence on
      Resilience, we needed to increase player survivability against other
      players, and we chose to do this by essentially doubling (post-squish)
      player health.
      
      
      On its own, that increase in health would make players more survivable in
      the world at large, so we're also increasing creature damage and the
      effectiveness of healing spells to balance things out. The net result of
      these changes is that individual attacks will knock a smaller chunk off of
      a player's health pool in PvP, but your survivability in PvE remains
      unaffected.
      
      
      Doubling player health gave us room to reduce Resilience and Battle
      Fatigue, but our goal was to be able to remove them entirely. In order to
      achieve that, we're also reducing PvP spike damage across the board by
      lowering Critical Damage and Critical Heals against players in PvP to 150%
      of their normal effect (down from 200%). The changes have allowed us to
      reduce Base Resilience to 0%, and [remove Battle Fatigue].[1]
      
      
      Changes to PvP
      
      
       * Base Resilience has been reduced to 0%.
       * Battle Fatigue has been [removed].[1]
       * Critical Damage and Critical Heals in PvP combat now deal 150% of the
         normal spell/ability effects (down from 200%).
      
      
      Changes to Health Pools
      
      
       * Amount of health gained per Stamina point has been doubled. The curve
         on this calculation has been smoothed out as well, so exact amount
         varies slightly by level.
       * Maximum mana has been doubled at all levels to keep pace with expected
         increases to maximum health from new Stamina values.
       * All consumables now restore twice as much health and mana.
       * All creatures had their melee damage doubled. Most creature spells and
         abilities have had their damage doubled as well.
       * All player-cast healing and absorption effects have been increased by
         approximately 50% in effectiveness. If they heal or absorb a percentage
         of maximum health, they are instead reduced by 25%. All other noted
         changes are in terms relative to that. 
          * For example, if another noted change is that "Mega Heal now heals
            for 40% more," that means that Mega Heal now heals for a total of
            210% of what it used to, which is relatively 40% higher compared to
            other heals.
         
         
      
      RETUNING HEALING SPELLS
      
      One of our goals for healing is to tone down the raw throughput of healers
      relative to the size of player health pools. Currently, as healers and
      their allies acquire better and better gear, the percentage of a player's
      health that any given heal restores increases significantly. As a result,
      healers are able to refill health bars so fast that we have to make damage
      more and more "bursty" in order to challenge them. Ideally, we want
      players to spend some time below full health without having healers feel
      like their groupmates are in danger of dying at any moment. We also think
      that healer gameplay would be more varied, interesting, and skillful if
      your allies spent more time between 0% and 100%, rather than just getting
      damaged quickly to low health, forcing the healer to then scramble to get
      them back to 100% as quickly as possible.
      
      
      To that end, we're buffing heals less than we're increasing player health.
      Heals will be deliberately less potent compared to health pools than
      before the item squish. Additionally, as gear improves, the scaling rates
      of health and healing will now be very similar, so the relative power of
      any given healing spell shouldn't climb so much over the course of this
      expansion. For those concerned about what this means for raiding, don't
      worry—we're taking all of these changes into account when designing Raid
      content for Warlords of Draenor.
      
      
      It's also important to note that spells that heal based on a percentage of
      maximum health are being effectively buffed by the massive increase to
      player health pools, so we're lowering those percentages to offset the
      effect. That may make them appear to have been nerfed—however, the net
      result is that those percentage-based heals stay about the same as before
      relative to other heals.
      
      
      All of these changes apply to damage-absorption shields as well.
      Additionally, we're toning down the power of damage absorption in general.
      When they get too strong, absorption effects are often used in place of
      direct healing, instead of as a way to supplement it. We will, of course,
      take these changes into account when tuning specializations that rely
      heavily on absorbs, such as Discipline Priests.
      
      
      We also took a look at healing spells that were passive or auto-targeted
      (so-called "smart" heals). We want healers to care about who they're
      targeting and which heals they're using, so that their decisions matter
      more. To that end, we're reducing the healing of many passive and
      auto-targeted heals, and making smart heals a little less smart. Smart
      heals will now randomly pick any injured target within range instead of
      always picking the most injured target. Priority will still be given to
      players over pets, of course.
      
      
      Another of our goals for healing in this expansion is to strike a better
      balance between single-target and multi-target healing spells. We've taken
      a close look at the mana efficiency of our multi-target heals, and in many
      cases, we're reducing their efficiency, usually by reducing the amount
      they heal. Sometimes, but more rarely, raising their mana cost was a
      better decision. We want players to use multi-target heals, but they
      should only be better than their single-target equivalents when they heal
      more than two players without any overhealing. This way, players will face
      a meaningful choice between whether to use a single-target heal or a
      multi-target heal based on the situation.
      
      
      Finally, we're removing the low-throughput, low-mana-cost heals like 
      [Nourish], [Holy Light], [Heal], and [Healing Wave], because we think that
      while they do add complexity, they don't truly add depth to healing
      gameplay. (We're also renaming some spells to re-use those names. For
      example, [Greater Healing Wave] is being redubbed Healing Wave.) However,
      we still want healers to think about their mana when deciding which heal
      to cast, and so the mana costs and throughputs of many spells are being
      altered to give players a choice between spells with lower throughput and
      lower cost versus spells with higher throughput and higher costs. Here are
      some examples from each healer class.
      
      Class Higher efficiency Higher throughput Druid [Healing Touch], 
      [Rejuvenation], [Efflorescence] [Regrowth], [Wild Growth] Monk [Soothing
      Mist], [Renewing Mist] [Surging Mist], [Spinning Crane Kick] Paladin [Holy
      Light], [Holy Shock], [Word of Glory], [Light of Dawn] [Flash of Light], 
      [Holy Radiance] Priest [Greater Heal], [Circle of Healing], [Prayer of
      Mending], [Holy Nova] (new Discipline-only version), [Penance] [Flash
      Heal], [Prayer of Healing] Shaman [Healing Wave], [Riptide], [Healing
      Rain] [Healing Surge], [Chain Heal] 
      All of this discussion of efficiency may cause most healers to start
      worrying about mana regeneration and their mana pool. To allay those
      concerns, we've increased base mana regeneration a great deal at early
      gear levels, while having it scale up less at later gear levels. This will
      make all of these changes play well even in early content such as Heroic
      Dungeons and the first tier of Raid content, and also play well in the
      final Raid tier without mana and efficiency becoming irrelevant due to
      extremely high regeneration values.
      
      
      That's a lot of big changes for healers: reduced throughput, a more
      deliberate pace, less powerful "smart" heals, weaker absorbs, fewer
      spells, and a new focus on efficiency decisions. We're confident that we
      can apply lessons learned from previous expansions to make this the best
      healer experience yet: more dynamic, less punishing, and frankly a lot
      more fun.
      
      
      General Changes to Healing
      
      
       * Smart heals will now randomly pick any injured target within range,
         instead of always picking the most injured target. Priority will still
         be given to players over pets.
       * Long-cast-time single-target heals, such as [Greater Heal] and [Healing
         Touch], now cost roughly half as much as fast-cast-time single-target
         heals, such as [Flash of Light] or [Healing Surge], and heal for
         roughly the same amount.
       * Every class has multiple area healing spells available, some low
         throughput and efficient, others high throughput and inefficient.
       * Area healing spells are tuned to be less efficient than single-target
         healing spells when they heal 2 or fewer targets, and more efficient
         when they heal 3 or more targets.
       * Spells with cooldowns or limitations may have higher efficiency than
         the no-cooldown equivalents.
      
      RACIAL TRAITS
      
      We want races to have fun and interesting perks, but if those traits are
      too powerful, players may feel compelled to play a specific race even if
      it doesn't suit their aesthetic preference. For example, trolls' 
      [Berserking] ability was extremely powerful, and their [Beast Slaying] 
      passive was often irrelevant, but occasionally tremendously powerful
      compared to other racial passives. On the other end of the spectrum, many
      races had few or no performance affecting perks. We also needed to replace
      or update a number of racials that previously granted Hit or Expertise,
      since those stats have been removed.
      
      
      We decided to bring down the couple high outliers, then establish a fair
      baseline and bring everyone else up to that. We achieved that by improving
      old passives, replacing obsolete ones, and occasionally adding new ones
      where needed. Our goal with these changes is to reach parity amongst
      races.
      
      
       * Blood elf 
          *  [Arcane Acuity] is a new racial passive ability that increases
            Critical Strike chance by 1%.
          *  [Arcane Torrent] now restores 20 Runic Power for death knights (up
            from 15 Runic Power), 1 Holy Power for paladins, or 3% of mana for 
            mages, priests, and warlocks (up from 2% of mana). Other parts of
            the ability remain unchanged.
         
         
       * Draenei 
          *  [Gift of the Naaru] now heals for the same amount over 5 seconds
            (down from 15 seconds).
          *  [Heroic Presence] has been redesigned. It no longer increases Hit 
            by 1%, and instead increases Strength, Agility, and Intellect,
            scaling with character level.
         
         
       * Dwarf 
          *  [Crack Shot] has been removed (was 1% Expertise with ranged
            weapons).
          *  [Mace Specialization] (was 1% Expertise with maces) has been
            replaced with Might of the Mountain.
          *  [Might of the Mountain] is a new racial passive ability that
            increases Critical Strike bonus damage and healing dealt by 2%.
          *  [Stoneform] now also removes magic and curse effects in addition to 
            poison, disease, bleed effects, and reduces physical damage taken by
            10% for 8 seconds (down from all damage taken). It remains unusable
            while the dwarf is under the effects of crowd control.
         
         
       * Gnome 
          *  [Expansive Mind] now increases maximum mana, energy, rage, and
            Runic Power by 5% instead of only increasing maximum mana.
          *  [Escape Artist]'s cooldown has been reduced to 1 minute (down from
            1.5 minutes).
          *  [Nimble Fingers] is a new racial passive ability that increases
            Haste by 1%.
          *  [Shortblade Specialization] (was 1% Expertise with one-handed
            swords and daggers) has been replaced with Nimble Fingers.
         
         
       * Goblin 
          *  [Time is Money] now grants a 1% increase to Haste (up from only
            attack speed and spell haste).
         
         
       * Human 
          *  [Mace Specialization] has been removed (was 1% Expertise with
            maces).
          *  [Sword Specialization] has been removed (was 1% Expertise with
            swords).
          *  [The Human Spirit] has been redesigned. It now increases
            Versatility, scaling with character level.
         
         
       * Night elf 
          *  [Quickness] now also increases movement speed by 2% in addition to
            increasing Dodge chance by 2%.
          *  [Touch of Elune] is a new passive ability which increases Haste by
            1% at night, and Critical Strike chance by 1% during the day.
         
         
       * Orc 
          *  [Axe Specialization] has been removed (was 1% Expertise with axes).
          *  [Command] now increases pet damage by 1% (down from 2%).
          *  [Hardiness] now reduces the duration of Stun effects by 10% (down
            from 15%).
         
         
       * Tauren 
          *  [Brawn] is a new racial passive ability that increases Critical
            Strike bonus damage and healing done by 2%.
          *  [Endurance] now increases Stamina by an amount scaling with
            character level, instead of increasing Base Health by 5%.
         
         
       * Troll 
          *  [Berserking] now increases Haste by 15% (down from 20%).
          *  [Beast Slaying] now increases XP earned from killing Beasts by 20%,
            instead of increasing damage dealt versus Beasts by 5%.
          *  [Dead Eye] has been removed (was 1% Expertise with ranged weapons).
         
         
       * Undead 
          *  [Will of the Forsaken]'s cooldown has been increased to 3 minutes
            (up from 2 minutes).
          * Undead can now breathe underwater indefinitely.
         
         
      
      ABILITY PRUNING AND CONSOLIDATION
      
      Over the years, we've added significantly more new spells and abilities to
      the game than we've removed. This has led to the complexity of the game
      increasing steadily over time, to the point we're at now, where players
      feel like they need dozens of keybinds. There are many niche abilities
      which could theoretically be useful in some rare case, but usually are
      not. There are many abilities that we'd be better off not having. We
      decided that we needed to make a strong push for paring down the number of
      abilities each class/spec has. That means making some abilities restricted
      to certain specs that really need them instead of being class-wide, and
      outright removing some other abilities. It also includes removing some
      Spellbook clutter, such as passives that could be merged with others, or
      with base abilities.
      
      
      However, this doesn't mean that we want to reduce the depth of gameplay,
      or "dumb it down." We still want there to be interesting decisions during
      combat, and for skill to matter. But, that doesn't require complexity; we
      can remove some needless complexity and still retain the depth and skill
      variance.
      
      
      One type of ability that we focused on is temporary power buffs
      ("cooldowns"). Removing those also helps achieve one of our other goals,
      which is to reduce the amount of cooldown stacking in the game. In cases
      where a class/spec had multiple cooldowns that typically ended up getting
      used together, often in a single macro, we merged them, or removed some of
      them.
      
      
      What abilities and spells got cut is a very, very difficult question to
      answer. Every ability is vital to someone, so we don't take this process
      lightly. We hope that even if we cut your favorite ability, you can see it
      in the context of our larger goals. It's important to remember that the
      point of these changes is to increase players' ability to understand the
      game, not to reduce depth of gameplay. We attempt to prune abilities with
      the intent to reduce the amount of keybind/macro bloat and merging
      abilities that served a similar purpose but are otherwise redundant
      together.
      
      
       * Additional changes 
          * Revised the levels at which class abilities are learned to provide a
            smoother leveling experience.
         
         
      
      
      Please see the classes section for changes specific to each class.
      
      CROWD CONTROL AND DIMINISHING RETURNS
      
      Another big takeaway from Mists of Pandaria is that there was simply too
      much crowd control (CC) in the game. To solve that, we knew that we needed
      an across-the-board disarmament. Here's a summary of the player-cast CC
      changes:
      
      
       * Removed Silence effects from all Interrupts. Silences still exist, but
         are never attached to an Interrupt.
       * Removed all Disarms.
       * Reduced the number of Diminishing Returns (DR) categories. 
          * All Roots now share the same DR category. 
             * Exception: Roots on 'Charge' types of abilities have no DR
               category, but have a very short duration instead.
            
            
          * All Stuns now share the same DR category.
          * All Incapacitate ("Mesmerize") effects now share the same DR
            category, and have been merged with the Horror DR category.
          * A list of which Diminishing Returns category each crowd-control
            ability belongs to can be found in the forum thread titled: 
            Diminishing Returns in Warlords of Draenor.
         
         
       * Removed the ability to make crowd-control spells with cast times into
         instant-cast with a cooldown.
       * Removed many crowd-control spells entirely, and increased the cooldowns
         and restrictions on others. 
          * Pet-cast CC is more limited and often removed.
          *  [Cyclone] can now be dispelled by Immunity effects and Mass Dispel.
          * PvP trinkets now grant immunity to reapplication of an effect from
            the same spell cast when they break abilities with persistent
            effects like [Solar Beam].
          * Long fears are now shorter in PvP, to account for the target also
            needing to run back afterward.
         
         
      
      
      Additionally, we've significantly reduced the number of
      throughput-increasing cooldowns and procs, in order to further reduce
      burst damage. Please keep in mind when reading the specifics of the patch
      notes that some classes may have lost abilities, or had the power of
      select abilities reduced. These changes were made in the context of the
      above goals. Other classes have a reduced crowd-control ability overall.
      We believe that this entire package of changes will make PvP a more
      enjoyable experience for everyone.
      
      
       * Death knight 
          *  [Rune of Swordbreaking] has been removed.

            canceled by immunity effects (i.e. [Divine Shield], [Ice Block],
            etc.), and can be dispelled by [Mass Dispel].
          * Disorienting Roar has been renamed to [Incapacitating Roar],
            incapacitates enemies instead of disorienting them, and its effect
            now shares Diminishing Returns with other Mesmerize effects.
          *  [Hibernate] has been removed.

               Breath.
            
            
          * Felhunter: [Spell Lock] now only interrupts spell casting and no
            longer Silences the enemy.
          *  [Mortal Coil] now shares Diminishing Returns with all other
            Mesmerize effects.
          * Observer: Optic Blast now only deals damage and interrupts spell
            casting. The ability no longer Silences the enemy.
          *  [Sear Magic]'s cooldown has been increased to 30 seconds (up from
            20 seconds).
          * Succubus: [Seduction] and Shivarra: [Mesmerize] now have a 30-second
            cooldown.
          * Terrorguard no longer casts Terrifying Roar (terrorguard ability) 
            when it dies.
          *  [Unbound Will]'s cooldown has been increased to 2 minutes (up from
            1 minute).
          * Voidwalker: Disarm has been removed.
          * Voidlord: Disarm has been removed.
         
         
       * Warrior 
          *  [Charge] now Roots the target (instead of stunning). The Root
            effect does not share a Diminishing Return with other Roots.
          *  [Disarm] has been removed.
          *  [Intimidating Shout] now has a 6-second duration in PvP (down from
            8 seconds).
          *  [Safeguard] no longer removes movement-impairing effects.
          *  [Warbringer] now causes Charge to stun the target for 1.5 seconds
            instead of rooting it.
         
         
      
      MOVEMENT SPEED
      
      Moving quickly has always been a powerful bonus in World of Warcraft;
      however, the logic of how various movement speed bonuses stack (or don't)
      has generally been inconsistent and poorly explained. Under the old
      set-up, each movement speed bonus would become more powerful when combined
      with another, so we would limit what can stack with what, and prevent
      certain abilities from being used when another one is already in effect.
      We decided to change the movement speed system to make it more
      transparent, with rules about stacking that are easier to understand, and
      with fewer restrictions.
      
      
      Previously, multiple movement speed modifiers on you were multiplicative,
      meaning that if you had two different +25% movement speed bonuses, they
      resulted in a total movement speed of 56% (1.25*1.25 = 1.56).
      
      
      Movement speed bonuses have been changed to be additive. The previous
      example with two different +25% movement speed bonuses would result in a
      total movement speed of +50%. The logic governing which bonuses stack with
      others has been simplified as well.
      
      
       * Movement speed buffs that are self-only or is a passive effect are
         considered non-exclusive, and will now all stack together additively.
       * Movement speed buffs that are temporary or could be applied to other
         players are considered exclusive, their effects do not stack, and only
         the highest bonus gets applied (in addition to non-exclusive movement
         speed buffs).
      
      
      Additionally, restrictions that prevented a player with a temporary speed
      bonus from receiving or activating a second temporary speed bonus have
      been removed. Both bonuses will now apply to the character, but only the
      one with the highest magnitude will have any effect.
      
      
      Examples of self-only passive bonuses: [Cat Form], Movement Speed
      enchants, [Quickness] racial for Night Elves, [Unholy Presence]
      
      
       * These will all stack additively with each other.
      
      
      Examples of shared or temporary bonuses: [Angelic Feather], [Sprint], 
      Stampeding Roar
      
      
       * All of these effects can now be applied simultaneously, but only the
         strongest one will have an effect.
      
      BUFFS AND DEBUFFS
      
      All specializations provide some common buffs and debuffs. These are
      important to the game because they encourage cooperation, make you
      stronger when you work together with others, and promote raid composition
      diversity. However, we saw room to revise these buffs and debuffs. In
      addition to the above changes, we revised which buffs and debuffs are
      provided by Hunter pets. Please see the Hunter Pet Abilities section for a
      full list of changes.
      
      
      Two new stats have been added that benefitted all players. Also added were
      three new debuffs (Weakened Armor, Physical Vulnerability, and Magic
      Vulnerability) that each benefitted only half of the group. While that
      could be interesting, the two physical debuffs were redundant, and felt
      that the two new stats would be better suited as raid buffs. So, we made
      that replacement.
      
      
       * Weakened Armor, Physical Vulnerability, and Magic Vulnerability 
          * Death Knight (Frost): [Brittle Bones] has been removed.
          * Death Knight (Unholy): [Ebon Plaguebringer] no longer causes
            Physical Vulnerability.
          * Druid: [Faerie Fire] no longer applies Weakened Armor.
          * Paladin (Retribution): [Judgments of the Bold] no longer causes
            Physical Vulnerability.
          * Rogue: [Expose Armor] no longer applies Weakened Armor.
          * Rogue: [Master Poisoner] has been removed.
          * Warlock: [Curse of the Elements] has been removed.
          * Warrior: [Sunder Armor] no longer applies Weakened Armor.
          * Warrior (Arms, Fury): [Colossus Smash] no longer causes Physical
            Vulnerability.
          * Warrior (Protection): [Devastate] no longer applies Weakened Armor.
         
         
       * Versatility 
          * Death Knight (Frost, Unholy): [Unholy Aura] now also provides 3%
            Versatility.
          * Druid: [Mark of the Wild] now also provides 3% Versatility.
          * Paladin (Retribution): [Sanctity Aura] is a new passive ability for
            Retribution paladins which grants 3% Versatility to the paladin and
            all allies within 100 yards.
          * Warrior (Arms, Fury): [Inspiring Presence] is a new passive ability
            for Arms and Fury warriors which grants 3% Versatility to the
            warrior and all allies within 100 yards.
         
         
       * Multistrike 
          * Monk (Windwalker): [Windflurry] is a new passive ability for
            windwalker Monks which grants 5% Multistrike to the monk and all
            allies within 100 yards.
          * Priest (Shadow): [Mind Quickening] now also grants 5% Multistrike.
          * Rogue: [Swiftblade's Cunning] now also grants 5% Multistrike.
          * Warlock: [Dark Intent] now grants 5% Multistrike instead of 10%
            Stamina. 
             *  [Blood Pact] is a new passive ability for warlocks which grants
               10% Stamina to the warlock and all allies within 100 yards.
            
            
         
         
      
      
      Weakened Blows was a debuff that mattered almost exclusively to tanks, and
      that every tank automatically applied. We removed the debuff and reduced
      creature damage to compensate.
      
      
       * Weakened Blows 
          * The following abilities no longer apply the Weakened Blows effect. 
             * Death knight (Blood): [Scarlet Fever]
             * Druid: [Thrash] (Bear Form); [Thrash] (Cat Form)
             * Monk: [Keg Smash]
             * Paladin: [Crusader Strike]; [Hammer of the Righteous]
             * Shaman: [Earth Shock]
             * Warrior: [Thunder Clap]
            
            
         
         
      
      
      The Cast Speed Slow was a debuff type that mattered almost exclusively to
      PvP, and made combat much less fun for casters in addition to encouraging
      the use of instant-cast spells. We decided that it was best to remove
      casting speed debuffs.
      
      
       * Cast Speed Slows 
          * The following abilities no longer slow the target's casting speed by
            50%. 
             * Death knight: [Necrotic Strike]
             * Mage (Arcane): [Slow] 
                * Additionally, Slow can now affect more than one target at a
                  time.
               
               
            
            
          * The following abilities have been removed. 
             * Rogue: Mind-Numbing Poison
             * Warlock: [Curse of Enfeeblement]
            
            
         
         
      
      
      As part of a push to combine the different types of Haste in the game as
      much as possible, we merged Spell Haste and Attack Speed into just Haste,
      which benefits everyone.
      
      
       * Spell Haste and Attack Speed 
          * The following abilities now provide a 5% increase to melee, ranged,
            and spell Haste to all Party and Raid members (previously they only
            increased spell Haste). 
             * Priest (Shadow): [Mind Quickening]
             * Shaman (Elemental): [Elemental Oath]
            
            
          * The following abilities now provide a 5% increase to melee, ranged,
            and spell Haste to all Party and Raid members (instead of a 10%
            increase to only melee and ranged attack speed). 
             * Death Knight (Frost, Unholy): [Unholy Aura]
             * Shaman (Enhancement): [Unleashed Rage]
             * Rogue: [Swiftblade's Cunning]
            
            
         
         
      
      
      Some classes received new abilities to provide some of harder-to-find
      buffs/debuffs, increasing their utility to the Party or Raid.
      
      
       * Other 
          *  [Legacy of the White Tiger] is now also learned by Brewmaster
            monks, granting a 5% increase to Critical Strike chance for all
            Party and Raid members.
          *  [Moonkin Form] now grants increased Mastery instead of 5% to Spell
            Haste.
          *  [Power of the Grave] is a new passive ability learned by Blood
            death knights. 
             * Power of the Grave grants a bonus to Mastery for all allies
               within 100 yards.
            
            
         
         
      
      RAID UTILITY BALANCE
      
      Various classes bring various abilities that provide utility to parties
      and raids. We talked about one type of utility in the Buffs and Debuffs
      section, above. However, there are other types of raid utility, and it's
      been in need of more attention. In general, raid utility, especially
      raid-wide defensive cooldowns, had grown too strong. So many classes and
      specializations had defensive cooldowns that we had to make raid damage
      extremely high, as raids would be stacking or chaining together multiple
      cooldowns. We'd like to return to a system where it's the healers who heal
      through the scary moments, not the damage dealers, for example.
      
      
      To do so, we've established a new baseline level of raid utility that a
      specialization should bring, and brought everyone to that new standard by
      reducing the effects of some abilities, or removing some abilities
      altogether.
      
      
       * Death knight 
          *  [Anti-Magic Zone] now reduces magic damage taken by 20% (down from
            40%).
         
         
       * Druid 
          *  [Tranquility] is now only available to Restoration druids.
         
         
       * Hunter 
          *  [Aspect of the Fox] is a new ability for all hunters. 
             * Aspect of the Fox: Party and raid members within 40 yards take on
               the aspects of a fox, allowing them to move while casting all
               spells for 6 seconds. Only one Aspect can be active at a time. 3
               minute cooldown.
            
            
         
         
       * Mage 
          *  [Amplify Magic] is a new spell available to mages. 
             * Amplify Magic amplifies the effects of helpful magic, increasing
               all healing received by 10% for all party and raid members within
               100 yards, and lasts 6 seconds with a 2-minute cooldown.
            
            
         
         
       * Monk 
          *  [Avert Harm] has been removed.
          *  [Stance of the Fierce Tiger]'s movement speed increase now affects
            the monk and all allies within 10 yards.
         
         
       * Paladin 
          *  [Devotion Aura] is now only available to Holy paladins.
         
         
       * Priest 
          *  [Hymn of Hope] has been removed.
         
         
       * Rogue 
          *  [Smoke Bomb] now reduces damage taken by 10% (down from 20%).
         
         
       * Shaman 
          *  [Ancestral Guidance] now causes 20% of damage or healing to be
            copied as healing to nearby injured allies (down from 40% of damage
            or 60% of healing).
          *  [Healing Tide Totem] is now available only to Restoration shaman.
          *  [Stormlash Totem] has been removed.
         
         
       * Warlock 
          * Each player can use a [Demonic Gateway] only once every 90 seconds.
          * Healthstones now share a cooldown with Health Potions, separate from
            other potions.
         
         
       * Warrior 
          *  [Rallying Cry] now increases health by 15% (down from 20%), and is
            no longer available to Protection warriors.
          *  [Skull Banner] has been removed.
         
         
      
      INSTANT-CAST HEALS
      
      Over time, healers have gained a bigger and bigger arsenal of heals that
      they can cast while on the move, which removes the inherent cost that
      movement is intended to have for them, while also limiting players'
      ability to counter healing in PvP. This left silences and crowd control (
      which we're trying to curb) as the only ways to actually limit an enemy
      player's healing output. We're still preserving the option to instantly
      heal, but are reducing the number of instant-cast healing abilities
      overall. Raid and dungeon encounter damage during high-movement phases
      will be adjusted accordingly.
      
      
       * Druid 
          *  [Wild Growth] (Restoration) now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from
            instant cast).
         
         
       * Monk 
          *  [Uplift] (Mistweaver) now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from
            instant cast).
         
         
       * Paladin 
          *  [Eternal Flame] now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant
            cast) for Holy Paladins.
          *  [Guarded by the Light] (Protection) now also makes Word of Glory
            and Eternal Flame instant cast.
          *  [Light of Dawn] now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant
            cast).
          *  [Sword of Light] (Retribution) now also makes Word of Glory and
            Eternal Flame instant cast.
          *  [Word of Glory] now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant
            cast).
         
         
       * Priest 
          *  [Cascade] now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast) for
            Discipline and Holy.
          *  [Halo] now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast) for
            Discipline and Holy.
          *  [Prayer of Mending] now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant
            cast).
         
         
      
      PERIODIC EFFECTS
      
      There are many effects in the game which deal periodic damage over time
      (DoT) or healing over time (HoT). Historically, these have typically done
      something called "snapshotting"; they were based on your stats at the time
      that they were cast, and that was used for calculating their effect for
      their full lifetime. In Mists, if a warlock casts Corruption on an enemy
      while Heroism is active, that DoT will continue to tick rapidly based on
      the temporary haste effect, even after Heroism fades. This has led to some
      gameplay that has both good and bad sides.
      
      
      Snapshotting encourages refreshing those periodic effects when your stats
      are high, such as when a temporary buff procs. On the upside, there's a
      high amount of skill involved in maximizing that. On the downside, it's
      not intuitive, and the skill ceiling is so high that few can reach it
      without the use of specialized add-ons. To make matters worse, the
      benefits of maximizing periodic snapshotting is so high that it creates a
      balance problem. Players maximizing periodic snapshotting (primarily
      through the use of add-ons) do drastically more damage than intended. If
      we balance around taking full advantage of snapshotting, then the players
      who aren't doing so would fall unacceptably far behind in damage output.
      
      
      Ultimately, we've decided that snapshotting isn't a productive mechanic
      for the game. The vast majority of periodic effects in the game that
      snapshotted no longer do so. The only exceptions are ones that do damage
      based on a percentage of a previous ability's damage (such as the Ignite 
      from a Fire mage's [Fireball], or the periodic damage on a Windwalker
      monk's [Blackout Kick]), as they inherently act as a delayed damage
      multiplier to those abilities. Temporary effects which buff the damage or
      healing of other spells specifically will continue to do so for their
      lifetime; for example, [Unleash Flame] (which increases the damage of the
      shaman's next fire spell by 40%), when used on a [Flame Shock], will
      continue to increase the damage of the periodic effect for its entire
      lifetime, despite being consumed when the Flame Shock is cast. We still of
      course want skills and their use to embody interesting choices, and
      intelligent and skillful use of abilities.
      
      
       * Periodic damage and healing effects now dynamically recalculate their
         damage, healing, Critical chance, multipliers, and period on every
         tick.
      
      
      Skilled players will still be able to take advantage of temporary power
      buffs like trinket procs, and you'll still want to cast your hardest
      hitting spells within those proc durations. The benefits just won't extend
      outside the trinket procs' duration. As such, this high-skill gameplay is
      there, it's just rewarded more consistently. For example, a Priest's
      trinket procs and an already active Shadow Word: Pain will begin dealing
      more damage the instant the proc effect occurs, but will return to normal
      when the proc duration ends. Skilled players will be able to play within
      these proc durations to maximize effect, but it won't be as detrimental to
      output to anyone who isn't actively and skillfully using them to their
      full extent.
      
      
      We also made another change to periodic effects. Haste has long affected
      the tick rate of periodic effects, and their duration has been rounded to
      whole numbers of ticks, in order to mostly preserve the original duration
      of the spell. This lead to Haste breakpoints where having specific amounts
      of Haste would cause certain periodic effects to gain an extra tick. Part
      of gearing your character involved trying to reach those Haste
      breakpoints, but not go over by too much. This was a fairly tedious number
      to manage, which was again mostly handled by add-ons and guides. With some
      new tech we're now able to calculate the effect of Haste on tick time
      dynamically. Any fraction of a full period left at the end of an effect
      will do a tick of damage or healing in proportion to the remaining time.
      In other words, there are no more Haste breakpoints; Haste now smoothly
      and accurately affects periodic effects for the entire duration.
      
      
      This also opened up the opportunity to revise how we handle refreshing
      periodic effects. For the vast majority of spells and abilities, we had a
      standard rule that any refresh would add the new cast's duration after the
      next tick of the existing effect. In simpler terms, you can refresh
      anywhere between the last and second-to-last tick of a DoT or HoT with no
      loss. Warlocks had a special passive that changed this logic to allow
      refreshing with no loss anywhere in the last 50% of a DoT. We liked the
      flexibility that this provided; though felt it was a bit too powerful. No
      longer tied to whole tick times, we chose to extend the mechanic that
      Warlocks had to all classes, but reduce it to 30%. Everyone can now
      refresh their periodic effects anywhere in the last 30% of the duration
      for full benefit, and no lost tick time.
      
      
       * Recasting periodic damage over time and healing over time effects that
         are already on the target now extends those effects to up to 130% of
         the normal duration of the effect.
      
      TANK VENGEANCE, RESOLVE, AND PVP
      
      The changes to tanking made in Mists of Pandaria turned out quite well,
      overall. But there were a few rough parts that we're going to smooth over.
      The biggest one is the offensive capabilities of Vengeance. We like that
      tanks can provide meaningful DPS to their group, however, it swung wildly
      based on the fight, even surpassing the dedicated damage dealers
      occasionally. To solve this, we're going to remove the offensive value of
      Vengeance, but preserve the defensive value, by making it increase the
      effect of your active mitigation buttons, instead of Attack Power.
      
      
       * General 
          * Vengeance has been removed and replaced with a new passive ability,
            Resolve. 
             *  [Resolve]: Increases self-healing and absorption based on damage
               taken (before avoidance and mitigation) in the last 10 seconds.
               Without Resolve, Tanks now deal significantly less self-healing
               and absorption. Resolve has been made much stronger to counteract
               this, and it increases the amount of self-healing and absorption
               as appropriate for the fight.
            
            
         
         
      
      
      Then, to keep tank DPS meaningful, we'll be raising their damage, since it
      would be meager with no Vengeance Attack Power (Vengeance accounted for
      70-90% of a tank's damage on high-tank-damage fights in Mists). To do
      that, we're increasing the damage of several prominent tank abilities. For
      plate-wearing Tank specializations, [Riposte] has been redesigned to
      convert Critical Strike into Parry, a defensive stat. That also helps keep
      secondary stats balanced in offensive value for them.
      
      
       * General 
          * All tanking stances and similar effects now increases threat
            generated by 900% (up from 600%).
          *  [Riposte] is a passive ability for Blood death knights, Protection
            paladins, and Protection warriors. 
             * Riposte now gives the character Parry equal to their Critical
               Strike bonus from gear.
            
            
         
         
       * Death knight 
          *  [Mastery: Blood Shield] now also passively increases Attack Power
            by 8% (percentage increased by Mastery), in addition to its current
            effects.
         
         
       * Druid 
          *  [Mastery: Primal Tenacity] now also passively increases Attack
            Power by 8% (percentage increased by Mastery), in addition to its
            current effects.
         
         
       * Monk 
          *  [Mastery: Elusive Brawler] now also passively increases Attack
            Power by 8% (percentage increased by Mastery), in addition to its
            current effects.
          * Brewmasters no longer deal 15% less damage.
         
         
       * Paladin 
          *  [Mastery: Divine Bulwark] now also passively increases Attack Power
            by 8% (percentage increased by Mastery), in addition to its current
            effects.
         
         
       * Warrior 
          *  [Mastery: Critical Block] now also passively increases Attack Power
            by 8% (percentage increased by Mastery), in addition to its current
            effects.
         
         
      
      TANKS IN PVP
      
      Finally, we have the topic of tanks in PvP. Apart from a few niche cases
      like flag carrying; tanks have been intentionally non-viable in serious
      PvP for several expansions now. The reason for this was simple: fighting
      against tanks was very frustrating, not fun. They were near-invincible,
      had numerous CC abilities (primary stuns), but did little enough damage to
      not be able to kill you (in most cases, anyway). By excluding them from
      PvP, we preserved the enjoyment of the rest of the playerbase. However,
      that has the obvious downside that people who prefer to play tanks are
      excluded from doing so in PvP.
      
      
      We decided that we could do better, and satisfy everyone involved. Our
      other changes to tanks in Warlords of Draenor got us most of the way
      there. Tanks' damage will already be tuned to be somewhat weaker than
      damage dealers, but not trivial. We've already removed the additional CC
      that they had during the CC Disarmament and Ability Pruning. All that
      remains that makes them frustrating to fight against is their
      invincibility. So, we're causing tanks to take increased damage in PvP, so
      that the net result is that they both deal and take somewhat less damage
      than damage dealers.
      
      
       * Tanks now take 25% additional damage while engaged in PvP combat.
      
      QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS
      FACING REQUIREMENTS
      
      Strict facing requirements can be frustrating to deal with, especially in
      hectic Raid combat or PvP environments. In order to ease this frustration,
      we decided to remove or significantly loosen the facing requirements of
      all attacks that required the player to be behind their target.
      
      
       * Druid: [Ravage] no longer requires the druid to be behind the target.
       * Druid: [Shred] no longer requires the druid to be behind the target.
       * Rogue: [Ambush] no longer requires the rogue to be behind the target.
       * Rogue (Subtlety): [Backstab] can now be used on either side of the
         target, in addition to behind the target.
      
      TOOLTIP CLARITY
      
      Being able to quickly understand what an ability does by glancing at the
      tooltip is of paramount importance to learn how to play with a given class
      or specialization. We've taken an extensive look at the tooltips for all
      class abilities, and revised them to be as clear and concise as possible.
      
      
      In some rare cases, we've removed mention of niche information that we
      don't think is needed. If that's the case, please note that a change to
      the ability's tooltip does not mean that functionality has changed. If the
      change in question is not mentioned in the Patch Notes, there has been no
      change to the ability.
      
      
       * Tooltips for nearly all class abilities have been revised for increased
         clarity.
      
      SELF-SUSTAINABILITY
      
      Another area of gameplay that we polished is how characters are able to
      sustain their own health, primarily when frequently killing enemies, such
      as in solo questing.
      
      
       * Death knight 
          *  [Glyph of Dark Succor] is no longer a Major Glyph and is now a
            passive ability learned by all death knights at level 60.
         
         
       * Druid 
          *  [Healing Touch] now heals for 50% more when self-cast for Balance
            druids.
          *  [Predatory Swiftness] now also increases the healing done by 
            [Healing Touch] by 20%.
         
         
       * Hunter 
          *  [Kill Shot] now heals the hunter for 15% of maximum health if it
            kills the target.
          *  [Survivalist] is a new passive ability learned by Survival Hunters
            at level 10. 
             * Survivalist increases the Hunter's chance to Multistrike by 10%.
               Additionally, the Hunter gains 15% health over 10 seconds after
               killing a target.
            
            
         
         
       * Mage 
          * Conjured Refreshments now restores 100% health and Mana over 20
            seconds, regardless of level.
         
         
       * Monk 
          *  [Afterlife] now always summons a Healing Sphere when an enemy is
            killed.
          *  [Glyph of Afterlife] has been removed and its effects are now
            baseline for Afterlife.
         
         
       * Paladin 
          *  [Supplication] now also increases [Flash of Light]'s healing by
            50%.
         
         
       * Priest 
          *  [Devouring Plague] now heals for 2% of maximum health per tick (up
            from 1%).
         
         
       * Rogue 
          *  [Recuperate] now heals for 5% of maximum health per tick (up from
            3%). [This is believed to be in error, as the change never actually
            went live.]
         
         
       * Shaman 
          *  [Maelstrom Weapon] now also increases the direct healing of
            affected spells by 10% per application.
          *  [Glyph of Healing Storm] has been removed and its effects are now
            baseline for Maelstrom Weapon.
         
         
       * Warlock 
          *  [Drain Life] now heals for 1.5% of maximum health per tick (up from
            1.0%).
          *  [Harvest Life] now increases the healing from Drain Life to 3% of
            maximum health per tick (up from 2.5%).
         
         
      
      REFORGING
      
      The original intent behind Reforging was to offer a way for players to
      customize their gear, but in practice it offered little in the way of true
      choice. Players attempting to optimize every piece of gear were well
      advised to look up how they were supposed to reforge an item in an online
      guide or tool that had already determined the optimal choice. It added yet
      another step to the list of things that must be done to a new item before
      it was ready to be equipped, reducing the joy of getting an upgrade into a
      chore.
      
      
      If an upgrade drops, we want you to be able to equip it with a minimum of
      fuss. It is for those reasons that we're removing Reforging from the game.
      
      
       * The Reforging system and associated NPCs have been removed from the
         game.
       * All existing items that were reforged have been returned to their
         original un-reforged state.
      
      COMBAT RESURRECTIONS
      
      Combat resurrections are an extremely powerful tool that players have
      while in combat. Naturally, we apply some limitations. In Mists of
      Pandaria, that limit was 1 resurrection during a given raid boss encounter
      for 10-player modes and 3 for 25-player modes. With Flexible difficulty
      introduced in Patch 5.4, we erred on the forgiving side, and gave Flexible
      Raids 3 resurrections regardless of raid size.
      
      
      In Warlords of Draenor, the Flex tech has expanded to more difficulty
      levels, and we needed a new system to handle combat resurrections more
      fairly. We knew that continuing with a constant 3 would encourage using
      the smallest possible raid sizes, while scaling with hard breakpoints
      would discourage specific group sizes just under those points.
      Additionally, the limit is not shown anywhere in-game, so it can be easy
      to lose track of how many resurrections the raid has available (or even
      know that the limit exists).
      
      
      So we've built a new system to be more transparent, and improve usability.
      
      
       * During a boss encounter, all combat resurrection spells now share a
         single raid-wide pool of charges that's visible on the action bar
         button.
       * Upon engaging a boss, all combat resurrection spells will have their
         cooldowns reset and begin with 1 charge. Charges will accumulate at a
         rate of 1 per (90/RaidSize) minutes. 
          * Example 1: A 10-player raid will accumulate 1 charge every 9 minutes
            (90/10 = 9).
          * Example 2: A 20-player raid will accumulate 1 charge every 4.5
            minutes (90/20 = 4.5).
         
         
       * A charge will only be deducted when a combat resurrection is successful
         (when the target accepts the resurrection).
       * Raid frames now show a debuff indicating that a dead player has a
         pending combat resurrection available.
       * Outside of raid boss encounters, combat resurrection spells retain
         their normal cooldown behavior.
      
      GLYPHS
      
      We made several improvements to the glyph system. While leveling,
      characters unlock glyph slots at several specific levels. However, in
      order to get glyphs, characters need to visit an Auction House (and
      potentially pay way more gold than an average character of that level has
      yet), or know a scribe from which to request them. To solve this, we've
      made characters learn some glyphs automatically as they level.
      Additionally, we now have the ability to make some glyphs exclusive with
      each other, or require specific specializations.
      
      
       * Many glyphs have been removed, and many new glyphs have been added.
       * Exclusive categories have been added for some glyphs. Other glyphs from
         the same category cannot be applied at the same time.
       * Some glyphs are now exclusive to a specialization.
       * All classes now learn some of their Major Glyphs as they level. Recipes
         for these Glyphs have been removed. 
          * At level 25, the following Glyphs are automatically learned by
            characters of the appropriate class: 
             * Druid: [Glyph of Entangling Roots], [Glyph of Fae Silence], 
               [Glyph of Ferocious Bite], [Glyph of Maul], [Glyph of Omens]( 
               [Glyph of Entangling Energy]), [Glyph of Cat Form]
             * Hunter: [Glyph of Liberation], [Glyph of Pathfinding]
             * Mage: [Glyph of Frost Nova], [Glyph of Blink]
             * Monk: [Glyph of Fortuitous Spheres], [Glyph of Rapid Rolling], 
               [Glyph of Victory Roll]
             * Paladin: [Glyph of Harsh Words], [Glyph of Flash of Light], 
               [Glyph of the Alabaster Shield], [Glyph of Dazing Shield], [Glyph
               of Avenging Wrath], [Glyph of Templar's Verdict]
             * Priest: [Glyph of Levitate], [Glyph of Holy Fire], [Glyph of
               Fade]
             * Rogue: [Glyph of Deadly Momentum], [Glyph of Stealth]
             * Shaman: [Glyph of Flame Shock], [Glyph of Thunder], [Glyph of
               Frost Shock], [Glyph of Healing Wave], [Glyph of Spiritwalker's
               Grace]
             * Warlock: [Glyph of Siphon Life], [Glyph of Drain Life], [Glyph of
               Demon Training], [Glyph of Ember Tap]
             * Warrior: [Glyph of Long Charge], [Glyph of Victory Rush], [Glyph
               of Bloodthirst], [Glyph of Gag Order]
            
            
          * At level 50, the following Glyphs are automatically learned by
            characters of the appropriate class: 
             * Druid: [Glyph of Rebirth], [Glyph of Rejuvenation], [Glyph of
               Savagery] ( [Glyph of Savage Roar])
             * Hunter: [Glyph of Mending], [Glyph of Chimaera Shot], [Glyph of
               Black Ice]
             * Mage: [Glyph of Polymorph]
             * Monk: [Glyph of Spinning Crane Kick] ( [Glyph of Targeted
               Expulsion])
             * Paladin: [Glyph of Denounce], [Glyph of Divine Storm], [Glyph of
               Word of Glory]
             * Priest: [Glyph of Reflective Shield], [Glyph of Smite], [Glyph of
               Mind Blast]
             * Rogue: [Glyph of Recuperate]
             * Shaman: [Glyph of Totemic Recall]
             * Warlock: [Glyph of Fear]
             * Warrior: [Glyph of the Executor]
            
            
          * At level 60, the following Glyphs are automatically learned by
            characters of the appropriate class: 
             * Death knight: [Glyph of Shifting Presences], [Glyph of Unholy
               Command], [Glyph of Death Grip]
            
            
          * At level 75, the following Glyphs are automatically learned by
            characters of the appropriate class: 
             * Death knight: [Glyph of Death and Decay]
             * Druid: [Glyph of Dash], [Glyph of Faerie Fire], [Glyph of Healing
               Touch], Glyph of Master Shapeshifter
             * Hunter: [Glyph of Misdirection]
             * Mage: [Glyph of Slow], [Glyph of Frostfire Bolt], [Glyph of Water
               Elemental]
             * Monk: [Glyph of Breath of Fire], [Glyph of Mana Tea], [Glyph of
               Fists of Fury]
             * Paladin: [Glyph of Light of Dawn], [Glyph of Final Wrath], [Glyph
               of Double Jeopardy]
             * Priest: [Glyph of Penance], [Glyph of Renew], [Glyph of
               Dispersion]
             * Rogue: [Glyph of Ambush], [Glyph of Cheap Shot]
             * Shaman: [Glyph of Lightning Shield], [Glyph of Eternal Earth]
             * Warlock: [Glyph of Healthstone]
             * Warrior: [Glyph of Bull Rush], [Glyph of Enraged Speed], [Glyph
               of Shield Wall]
            
            
         
         
      
      PROFESSIONS
      
      Some of our goals with professions in Warlords of Draenor are to make them
      more of a personal choice, and less of a mandatory "min/max" selection. To
      that end, we're removing the direct combat benefits of professions.
      Additionally, we've made it easier to level Mining and Herbalism. Healing
      potions have gone mostly unused lately, compared to combat stat potions.
      We chose to solve that problem, along with a problem with warlock utility,
      by having healing potions and Healthstones share cooldowns.
      
      
       * Herbalists can now harvest herbs throughout the game world without hard
         skill requirements. The yield an herbalist will be able to harvest from
         each node is now determined by skill level.
       * Miners can now harvest mineral nodes in outdoor areas of the game world
         without hard skill requirements. The yield a miner will be able to
         harvest from each node is now determined by skill level.
       * Healing potions no longer share a cooldown with other potions, but
         instead share a 60-second cooldown with Healthstones. The cooldown will
         not reset until the player leaves combat.
       * Movement Speed enchants now increase Movement Speed by 10% (up from
         8%).
      
      TRANSFORMATION EFFECTS
      
      The Transformation system has been improved. Characters can now be
      affected by multiple transformation effects at once. While multiple
      transformation or shapeshift effects are active, only the highest priority
      one will be visible. This allows transformation effects to persist while
      shapeshifts are active. Additionally, many restrictions on being
      transformed have been removed.
      
      CLASS CHANGES
      DEATH KNIGHT
      
      A number of changes were made for death knights. Several cooldowns were
      made spec-specific. Frost and Unholy's rotations remain unchanged for the
      most part. Blood received revisions to their Active Mitigation design to
      bring them up to par with changes to other Tanking specializations. Runic
      Power generation of [Anti-Magic Shell] was standardized, to make it more
      understandable and balanced.
      
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for a discussion of why we're
      pruning class abilities. For death knights, this focused on removing
      abilities that were redundant, cooldown reduction, or abilities that were
      not used often.
      
      
       *  [Blood Parasite] has been removed.
       *  [Blood Strike] has been removed.
       *  [Dark Command] is now only available to Blood death knights.
       *  [Dual Wield] is now only available to Frost death knights.
       *  [Frost Strike] replaces [Death Coil] for Frost death knights.
       *  [Obliterate] replaces Blood Strike for Frost death knights.
       *  [Necrotic Strike] has been removed.
       *  [Raise Dead] is now only available to Unholy death knights.
       *  [Rune of Cinderglacier] has been removed.
       *  [Rune of the Nerubian Carapace] has been removed.
       *  [Unholy Frenzy] has been removed.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      The biggest change here is the merger of Blood Boil into Pestilence. This
      change effectively turned Roiling Blood into a passive ability; which we
      replaced with a new talent, Plaguebearer. For Blood specialization, we
      removed Rune Strike and are adjusting the cost of Death Coil so that it
      can be used in Rune Strike's place.
      
      
      Another change was to polish up the effect of diseases on the damage of
      other abilities. Diseases now do enough damage on their own to warrant
      using them. Having diseases act as multipliers on the damage of other
      abilities became extraneous and cluttered up the tooltips of those
      abilities. Those multipliers have been removed, and consolidated their
      benefits into the corresponding base spell. These changes also results in
      a slight reduction to ramp-up time.
      
      
       *  [Horn of Winter] no longer generates Runic Power, has no cooldown, and
         lasts 1 hour.
       *  [Blood Boil] has been removed and its effects have been merged into
         Pestilence. 
          *  [Pestilence] now deals damage to all enemies within 10 yards, and
            spreads any diseases on targets hit to the other targets hit.
         
         
       *  [Army of the Dead] now deals 75% less damage.
       *  [Master of Ghouls] has been removed and its effects have been merged
         into the baseline Raise Dead ability for Unholy death knights.
       *  [Threat of Thassarian] has been removed and its effects have been
         merged into Might of the Frozen Wastes.
       *  [Rune Strike] has been removed. Blood death knights should now use
         Death Coil in its place.
       *  [Dancing Rune Weapon] now lasts 8 seconds (down from 12 seconds).
       *  [Death Coil] now costs 30 Runic Power (down from 40 Runic Power), and
         has a 40 yard range for both hostiles and allies. 
          *  [Sudden Doom] no longer reduces the cost of Death Coil.
         
         
       *  [Icebound Fortitude] now lasts 8 seconds (down from 12 seconds).
       *  [Roiling Blood] has been removed and replaced with Plaguebearer, a new
         Level-56 talent for death knights. 
          *  [Plaguebearer] causes Death Coil and Frost Strike to extend the
            duration of Frost Fever and Blood Plague, or add a stack of Necrotic
            Plague.
         
         
       *  [Pestilence] now deals 50% more damage, but no longer deals additional
         damage for diseases being present on the target.
       *  [Pillar of Frost] now increases Strength by 15% (down from 20%).
       *  [Obliterate] now deals 25% more damage on both main and off-hand
         weapons, but no longer deals additional damage for each disease present
         on the target.
       *  [Rune of the Fallen Crusader] now increases Strength by 20% (up from
         15%).
       *  [Scourge Strike] no longer deals additional damage for each disease
         present on the target. The ability now deals 100% Physical weapon
         damage, and 50% Shadow weapon damage. These two effects can
         independently critically hit.
       *  [Vampiric Blood] now increases the amount of healing received by 15%
         (down from 25%). 
          *  [Glyph of Vampiric Blood] now increases the amount of healing
            received by an additional 10% (down from 15%).
         
         
      
      FROST CHANGES
      
      In Mists of Pandaria, Frost death knights suffered from rotations that
      were designed to allow flexibility in ability usage, so that you could
      pool some resources in order to make decisions about which ones you spent
      and in which order. Dual Wield vs Two-Handed had different rotational
      priorities, with different strengths and weaknesses. However, tuning ended
      up such that you reached a point where you just had to spend all of your
      resources as fast as possible to avoid wasting any, and all of that depth
      went out the window. For Warlords, we've adjusted the tuning of several
      abilities and passives, to ensure that that doesn't happen again, and the
      rotational decisions and skill are maintained.
      
      
      The goal is that Two-Handed Frost death knights favor their physical
      damage, slicing through their enemies with heavy Obliterates, whereas
      Dual-Wielders favor blasting their foes with frost damage, but both
      overlap considerably to maintain a cohesive specialization.
      
      
       *  [Frost Strike]'s damage has been increased by 100%, but its Runic
         Power cost has been increased by 5 (up to 25 Runic Power in Frost
         Presence, and 40 Runic Power in other Presences).
       *  [Icy Talons] now increases attack speed by 20% (down from 45%), and
         haste by 5% (up from 0%).
       *  [Might of the Frozen Wastes] now increases the damage of Obliterate by
         50% (up from 40%) and melee damage by 35% (up from 30%) while wielding
         a two-handed weapon, and increases the damage of Frost Strike by 50%
         (up from 35%) while dual-wielding.
       *  [Rune of Razorice] now deals 4% additional weapon damage (up from 2%),
         and increases Frost damage by 2% per stack (down from 3%).
       *  [Obliterate]'s damage has been increased by 30%.
      
      UNHOLY CHANGES
      
      In order to better balance the scaling rates and value of secondary stats
      for Unholy death knights, we reduced the power of their passive [Unholy
      Might] ability, and added a new passive ability to make Multistrike more
      effective.
      
      
       *  [Necrosis] is a new passive ability for Unholy Death Knights. 
          * Necrosis causes Multistrikes from Festering Strike, Pestilence,
            Plague Strike, Scourge Strike, and Soul Reaper to also deal a burst
            of Shadow damage. The amount of burst damage is based on Attack
            Power, not the damage from the triggering Multistrike.
         
         
       *  [Unholy Might] now increases Strength by 10% (down from 35%).
      
      BLOOD CHANGES
      
      Active Mitigation was a very successful design that was inspired by death
      knights' tanking style. However, it went beyond that, and death knights
      themselves were somewhat left behind in that regard. We made several
      changes to bring up the interactivity of Blood combat. This includes
      making [Death Strike] cause healing based on attack power, but be affected
      by the new [Resolve] passive (see tank vengeance and resolve above), which
      gives it the traditional increase from recent damage. Plus, [Rune Tap] is
      being significantly improved, to become a strong Active Mitigation button.
      Additionally, we removed Dodge and Parry from gear, and expect Blood death
      knights to value Haste and Crit as important secondary stats. In order to
      achieve that, we made [Riposte] give defensive value to Critical Strikes,
      and Scent of Blood give defensive value to Multistrike. To solve
      GCD-capping issues and increase the value of Haste, we also removed the
      passive rune regeneration increase from Improved Blood Presence. Finally,
      we tweaked the targeting AI of [Dancing Rune Weapon], and fixed it up to
      properly copy most talents that you know.
      
      
       *  [Blood Rites] now also causes auto attack multistrikes to generate 15
         Runic Power. The Death Strike damage increase it provided has been
         moved to Veteran of the Third War.
       *  [Blood Presence] now increases Stamina by 20% (down from 25%), and
         armor by 30% (down from 55%).
       *  [Bone Shield] charges can now be consumed at a rate of once per second
         (up from once every 2 seconds).
       *  [Crimson Scourge] now increases the damage of Pestilence by 50% (up
         from 10%) and now also increases the damage of diseases by 30%.
       *  [Dancing Rune Weapon]'s summoned Rune Weapon now remains fixated on
         the death knight's target at the time of summoning, and copies the
         effects of talents that are tied to the death knight, such as [Blood
         Boil], [Frost Fever], or [Asphyxiate]. Should the original target be
         dead or otherwise unavailable, the Rune Weapon will switch to assist
         with the death knight's current target.
       *  [Death Strike] now causes healing that scales in effectiveness with
         attack power, instead of based on damage taken in the last 5 seconds.
         This healing is affected by [Resolve].
       *  [Heart Strike] has been removed. Blood death knights should use 
         [Pestilence] in its place.
       *  [Improved Blood Presence] now increases all damage dealt by 15%,
         instead of increasing rune regeneration rate.
       *  [Rune Tap] has been redesigned. It now reduces all damage taken by 40%
         for 3 seconds. It also now has 2 charges, with a 40-second recharge
         time. 
          *  [Will of the Necropolis] has been redesigned. It now automatically
            triggers an immediate, free Rune Tap when you take damage that
            reduces you below 30% health. This effect cannot occur more often
            than once every 30 seconds.
          *  [Glyph of Rune Tap] has been redesigned. It now reduces Rune Tap's
            recharge time by 10 seconds, but reduces the damage reduction it
            provides by 20%.
         
         
       *  [Scarlet Fever] has been removed. Its effects have been merged into
         Scent of Blood. 
          *  [Scent of Blood] has been changed. It now causes Pestilence to
            refresh diseases, and increase the healing of your next [Death
            Strike] by 20%, stacking up to 5 times.
         
         
       *  [Veteran of the Third War] now increases multistrike chance, and haste
         by 10% (instead of 9% to Stamina), reduces the chance for attacks to be
         parried by 3%, increases the damage of Death Strike by 100%, and grants
         1 Runic Power per second while in combat.
      
      DEATH PACT
      
      Since the Ghoul pet is now Unholy only, that presents a problem for [Death
      Pact]. We revised Death Pact to not require an undead minion, but work a
      little differently. We left it at 50% heal, which is effectively a 33%
      buff to it from before (see retuning healing spells and player health and
      resilience above), and added a healing absorption shield for 50% of the
      amount healed instead. It should now be a more effective heal for staying
      alive immediately, but with the downside of needing to heal through the
      healing absorption shield before being healed any further.
      
      
       *  [Death Pact] no longer requires an undead minion, and instead places a
         healing absorption shield on the death knight for 50% of the amount
         healed.
      
      MISCELLANEOUS
      
      There were also a few other miscellaneous changes. The Runic Power
      generation of Anti-Magic Shell was standardized, to make it more
      understandable and balanced. Level-60 and Level-75 talent rows have
      swapped places, so the important rune regeneration talents could be
      acquired earlier. Conversion was changed to cost different amounts by
      specialization, instead of reducing Runic Power generation differently by
      specialization. This way, Runic Power beyond what you spend on Conversion
      is not penalized.
      
      
       *  [Anti-Magic Shell] now restores 2 Runic Power per 1% of max health
         absorbed.
       *  [Desecrated Ground] now also makes the death knight immune to Roots
         and Snares.
       *  [Conversion] no longer has an initial tick, and now costs 30 Runic
         Power/second for Blood, 10 Runic Power/second for Frost, and 20 Runic
         Power/second for Unholy.
       * Level-60 and Level-75 talent rows have swapped places.
       * Level-60 rune regeneration talents can now be triggered by all Runic
         Power spenders 
          *  [Blood Tap] now generates one charge for every 15 Runic Power
            spent.
          *  [Runic Empowerment] now has a 1.5% chance to trigger per Runic
            Power spent.
          *  [Runic Corruption] now has a 1.5% chance to trigger per Runic Power
            spent.
         
         
      
      DRUID
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning
      class abilities. For Druids, we focused thinning out the niche and
      abilities that were not used often. We made sure to retain abilities for
      Druids to function in off-spec roles, since that flexibility is a defining
      characteristic of the class.
      
      
       *  [Barkskin] is now available to Balance, Guardian, and Restoration
         druids.
       *  [Enrage] has been removed.
       *  [Faerie Fire] is now available only to Feral and Guardian druids.
       *  [Innervate] has been removed.
       *  [Lacerate] is now available only to Guardian druids.
       *  [Leader of the Pack] no longer restores Mana and is only available to
         Feral druids. 
          * Mana regeneration has been increased by 100% for Feral and Guardian
            druids.
         
         
       *  [Mangle] (Cat Form) has been removed.
       *  [Maul] is now available only to Guardian Druids.
       *  [Might of Ursoc] has been removed.
       *  [Nature's Swiftness] is now available only to Restoration druids.
       *  [Nourish] has been removed.
       *  [Owlkin Frenzy] has been removed.
       *  [Rip] is now available only to Feral druids.
       *  [Survival Instincts] is now available only to Feral and Guardian
         Druids.
       *  [Swipe] is now requires the druid to be in Cat Form and is available
         only to Feral druids.
       *  [Symbiosis] has been removed.
       * Thrash is now available to all druid specializations (was Feral and
         Guardian only).
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      For consolidation of abilities, we merged several passive abilities. One
      notable change is the merging of the Ravage into Shred, and Pounce into
      Rake; saving a couple keybinds that were only used in conjunction with
      Prowl.
      
      
       * Cat Form now increases movement speed by 30% (up from 25%).
       *  [Infected Wounds] has been removed and its effects have been
         incorporated into Mangle and Shred for Feral and Guardian druids.
       *  [Lifebloom] can no longer stack, and its healing has been increased to
         compensate.
       *  [Omen of Clarity] (Feral) now affects druid spells and abilities that
         cost Energy.
       *  [Rake] now also stuns the target for 4 seconds if used while
         stealthed, and is only available to Feral druids. 
          *  [Pounce] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated
            into Rake.
         
         
       *  [Regrowth] now has a duration of 12 seconds (up from 6 seconds), but
         no longer refreshes its duration on targets at or below 50% health.
       *  [Revive]'s mana cost has been reduced by 87%.
       *  [Rip] now has a duration of 24 seconds (up from 16 seconds), but its
         duration is no longer extended by Shred.
       *  [Shred] no longer requires the Druid to be behind the target (See
         also: facing requirements.) and is now available to all
         specializations. Shred now deals 35% more damage in addition to having
         double the normal chance to critically strike while stealthed. 
          *  [Ravage] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated
            into Shred.
         
         
       *  [Skull Bash] no longer increases the mana cost of the victim's spells.
       *  [Starfall] no longer cancels when mounting. However, it can no longer
         hit stealthed or invisible targets.
       *  [Survival Instincts] no longer requires or forces the druid into Cat
         or Bear Form, and now lasts 6 seconds (down from 12 seconds) with a
         2-minute cooldown (down from 3 minutes), and can have up to 2 charges
         (up from 1 charge).
       *  [Thick Hide] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated
         into Bear Form. 
          * Bear Form now increases armor by 250% for all druid specializations
            (down from 330% for Guardian druids, but up from 120% for
            non-Guardian druids), no longer increases Haste and Critical Strike
            from items by 50%, but instead causes Haste to reduce the global
            cooldown, increases Stamina by 20% (down from 40%), and reduces
            magic damage taken by 10% (down from 25%).
          * For Guardian druids, Bear Form now also reduces magical damage taken
            by 25%, reduces chance to be critically hit by 6%, and reduces
            chance for attacks to be parried by 3%.
         
         
       *  [Tiger's Fury] now lasts 8 seconds (up from 6 seconds) and is usable
         during Berserk.
       *  [Track Humanoids] has been removed and its effects have been
         incorporated into Cat Form.
       *  [Travel Form] now automatically transitions between Aquatic, Land, and
         Flight forms depending on the Druid's location. 
          *  [Glyph of the Stag] now teaches the Druid a separate shapeshift
            ability, Stag Form. Stag Form allows the Druid to act as a mount for
            party members and will not switch between different Travel Forms.
         
         
       * Wild Mushrooms no longer become invisible.
      
      GUARDIAN CHANGES
      
      Guardian druids had increased Armor as their Mastery for a while now.
      However, one of the new secondary stats available to all tanks is Bonus
      Armor. We didn't feel that the difference of being additive vs. being a
      multiplier was significant enough to warrant keeping their Mastery around.
      Additionally, active mitigation hasn't played out as well for Guardians as
      it has for some other tanks. We decided to redesign the Mastery for
      Guardian druids to something that compliments the Avoidance-heavy nature
      of [Savage Defense], and also to improve the usability of [Tooth and Claw] 
      for more consistent damage reduction. Note that [Mastery: Primal Tenacity]
      's calculation uses the damage before any other absorbs you have, and
      before Tooth and Claw's effects, so that it isn't negatively affected by
      any of the changes.
      
      
      The maximum number of charges that can be accumulated for [Savage Defense] 
      has been reduced to make its uptime more consistent between short and long
      periods of tanking. Rage for Guardian druids has been problematic
      throughout Mists of Pandaria. Most of their rage generation was extremely
      passive, and most of their button presses either didn't affect their
      survivability, or only trivially did so. We made changes to Haste and
      Critical Strike, to try to solve these rage generation problems, and
      improve their rotation. We also added Ursa Major, in order to give a
      defensive value to the new Multistrike stat.
      
      
       * Guardian druids' Mastery ( [Nature's Guardian]) has been replaced with
         a new Mastery: Primal Tenacity. 
          *  [Mastery: Primal Tenacity] causes the druid to gain a Physical
            absorb shield equal to 12% of the attack's damage when they are hit
            by a Physical attack. Attacks which this effect fully or partially
            absorbs cannot trigger Primal Tenacity.
         
         
       *  [Ursa Major] is a new passive ability for Guardian druids. 
          * Ursa Major causes Multistrikes from auto attacks, Lacerate periodic
            damage, and Mangle to grant the druid the Ursa Major effect. Ursa
            Major increases maximum health by 2% for 25 seconds. When the effect
            is refreshed, the remaining portion is added to the new effect.
         
         
       * Auto-attacks now generate 5 Rage (down from 10.9 Rage).
       *  [Bear Form] no longer increases Haste and Critical Strike from items
         by 50%, but instead causes Haste to reduce the global cooldown.
       *  [Faerie Fire] no longer has a chance to reset Mangle's cooldown.
       *  [Maul] now costs 20 Rage (down from 30 Rage).
       *  [Mangle] now generates 10 Rage (down from 15 Rage).
       *  [Lacerate] now generates 2 Rage, has no cooldown (down from a 3-second
         cooldown), and the periodic bleed effect triggers every 1 second (down
         from 3 seconds).
       *  [Primal Fury] now generates 8 Rage (down from 15 Rage) from
         non-periodic critical strikes (up from only Auto Attacks and Mangle).
       *  [Savage Defense] can now accumulate 2 charges (down from 3 charges),
         and regenerates a charge every 12 seconds (up from 9 seconds).
       *  [Soul of the Forest] (Guardian) now increases Mangle's Rage generation
         by 5 (down from 10).
       *  [Thrash] now generates 1 Rage every time it deals direct or periodic
         damage, has no cooldown (down from a 6-second cooldown), but no longer
         has a chance to reset Mangle's cooldown.
       *  [Tooth and Claw] can now accumulate 2 charges, its effects stack on
         the target, and are affected by Resolve.
      
      FERAL CHANGES
      
      Feral druids received one major change, and few tweaks beyond what's been
      mentioned above in ability pruning and facing requirements. Combo Points 
      are now stored "on the player", meaning that when you switch targets, any
      accumulated Combo Points remain with you. [Primal Fury] was changed to let
      it affect area attacks as well. Critical strike chance of [Ferocious Bite] 
      was changed in order to increase the value of Critical Strike. [Glyph of
      Savage Roar] was reworked to better achieve its intended effect.
      
      
       * Combo Points for Feral druids are now shared across all targets, and
         are no longer lost when switching targets.
       *  [Ferocious Bite] now has double the normal chance to critically strike
         against bleeding targets (instead of having an additional 25% chance to
         critically strike).
       *  [Primal Fury] now also grants a combo point for area attacks that
         critically strike the druid's primary target.
       *  [Glyph of Savagery] has been renamed [Glyph of Savage Roar], and now
         grants a free 5 combo point [Savage Roar] when leaving [Prowl], instead
         of allowing Savage Roar to be used with 0 combo points.
      
      BALANCE REBALANCED
      
      We have some extensive changes for Balance druids. One of our guiding
      principles with game design is that things should be "easy to learn, hard
      to master". We're not particularly happy with the Moonkin rotation because
      it was actually hard to learn, and easy to master (especially with regards
      to periodic damage effects no longer snapshotting). Energy and [Eclipse] 
      mechanics were not intuitive for many newer players. Once you became
      accustomed to the rotation, there wasn't much additional depth to
      mastering it; maintain two DoTs, hit these other two buttons whenever they
      light up, and spam one of two buttons in between. In order to try to make
      it easier to learn, but also add some gameplay depth and challenge we're
      making a significant revision to the rotation. The list of changes is
      quite dense, so here's a summary of the changes.
      
      
      Summary of changes to Balance:
      
      
       * Balance Energy is a bar that automatically cycles back and forth
         between Lunar and Solar sides, like night and day. The closer to one
         end that the bar is, the more damage that side's spells do.
       * Balance druids now have four rotational spells. 
          *  [Starfire]: Lunar direct damage spell 
             * Cast when the Lunar side is stronger
            
            
          *  [Wrath]: Solar direct damage spell 
             * Cast when the Solar side is stronger
            
            
          *  [Moonfire]: Lunar periodic damage spell. While closer to Solar,
            this button is replaced with [Sunfire], a Solar periodic damage
            spell. 
             * Maintain both effects where possible
            
            
          *  [Starsurge]: Direct damage spell that benefits from whichever side
            is stronger. Has up to 3 charges, and buffs the damage of the next
            few Wraths or Starfires. 
             * Cast when able to follow up with a few strong Wraths or
               Starfires.
            
            
         
         
      
      
      That's the basics of the new Moonkin rotation. There's room for
      improvement beyond that, learning to optimally maintain both periodic
      damage effects while maximizing their damage, timing Starsurges to
      optimize the benefit of its buff, make use of [Starfall] and [Hurricane] 
      for area damage, and taking advantage of the strengths of each side (such
      as Moonfire and Sunfire having significant differences now). Here are the
      full details of the changes.
      
      
      Details of changes to Balance:
      
      
       * Balance Energy system has been redesigned. Balance Energy is a bar that
         cycles back and forth between Lunar and Solar sides, like night and
         day, with a 40 second cycle time (from Lunar to Solar and back to
         Lunar). 
          * Balance Energy is no longer generated through spells, talents, or
            other effects anymore.
         
         
       *  [Eclipse] has been redesigned. 
          * Eclipse inspires the druid with the power of the moon and the sun,
            causing the damage of Lunar and Solar spells to be increased by up
            to 30% based on how close Balance Energy levels are to the
            appropriate side. 
             * Example: With 0 Balance Energy, the damage bonus is evenly split
               between Lunar and Solar, and the Druid receives a 15% increase to
               damage for both spell types. With 80 Solar Energy, the Druid
               receives a 27% damage increase to Solar spells and a 3% damage
               increase to Lunar spells.
            
            
          *  [Mastery: Total Eclipse] now increases the maximum damage bonus of
            Eclipse by 12% (increasing with Mastery).
          * The damage of damage-over-time effects changes dynamically as
            Eclipse changes.
         
         
       *  [Astral Communion] now increases the rate that Balance Energy cycles
         by 300% while channeled.
       *  [Astral Storm] has been removed.
       *  [Celestial Alignment] has been redesigned. 
          * Celestial Alignment causes the Druid to enter Celestial Alignment, a
            state where Balance Energy cycle is paused, all damage done is
            increased by 20%, and all Lunar and Solar spells benefit from the
            maximum Eclipse bonus. While in Celestial Alignment, Moonfire and
            Sunfire will also apply the other spell's periodic damage effect.
            Lasts 15 seconds with a 3 minute cooldown.
         
         
       *  [Hurricane] now has a range of 35 yards (up from 30 yards), but is
         only available to Balance and Restoration druids.
       *  [Incarnation]: Chosen of Elune now increases spell damage by 15% while
         active (was a 25% increase to Arcane and Nature damage, but only while
         Eclipse is active).
       *  [Lunar Shower] has been redesigned and renamed into Astral Showers. 
          *  [Astral Showers] calls upon greater Lunar and Solar energy to
            permanently empower the Druid's Moonfire and Sunfire spells. 
             * Moonfire's periodic damage effect duration is increased by 100%.
             * Sunfire's periodic damage effect is now applied to all enemies
               within 5 yards of the target.
            
            
         
         
       *  [Moonfire] now has a base duration of 20 seconds (up from 14 seconds),
         but is no longer extended by Starfire and [Starsurge] critical strikes.
         Upon reaching 100 Lunar Energy, the next Moonfire deals 100% additional
         initial damage.
       *  [Shooting Stars] now adds 1 full charge of Starsurge and Starfall when
         it triggers, and now has a 5% chance to trigger when the most recent
         Moonfire or Sunfire deals periodic damage. This chance is doubled on
         critical strikes.
       *  [Soul of the Forest] (Balance) has been redesigned. 
          * Soul of the Forest (Balance) now increases the damage bonus from
            Lunar and Solar Empowerment by an additional 15%.
         
         
       *  [Starfall] now shares charges with Starsurge, and has no cooldown of
         its own. It also now hits all nearby enemies (up from 2 nearby
         enemies).
       *  [Starfire] now has a 3 second cast time (up from 2.7 seconds).
       *  [Starsurge] now has 3 charges and a 30 second recharge time (instead
         of a 15 second cooldown). Starsurge now also grants Lunar or Solar
         Empowerment. 
          * Lunar Empowerment causes the next 2 casts of Starfire to deal 30%
            more damage.
          * Solar Empowerment causes the next 3 casts of Wrath to deal 30% more
            damage.
         
         
       *  [Sunfire] is no longer its own spell and replaces Moonfire on the
         action bar whenever Balance Energy is on the Solar side. Sunfire now
         has a base duration of 24 seconds (up from 14 seconds), but is no
         longer extended by Wrath and Starsurge critical strikes. Enemies may
         still suffer from both Moonfire and Sunfire’s periodic damage
         components simultaneously. Upon reaching 100 Solar Energy, the next
         Sunfire deals 100% additional initial damage.
       *  [Wild Mushroom] (Balance) now begins snaring enemies immediately when
         summoned, lasts 20 seconds, and can no longer be detonated to deal
         damage. 
          *  [Wild Mushroom: Detonate] has been removed.
         
         
      
      TRANQUILITY SIMPLIFICATION
      
       [Tranquility] has an amazingly strong effect (pour a ton of healing into
      the whole raid/party), but had excessive complexity for a relatively
      simple task (5 different targets per tick, a short HoT, stacking, varied
      strength by raid size). So, we simplified it significantly. It still will
      be used just as it always has been.
      
      
       *  [Tranquility] now heals every Party and Raid member within range every
         2 seconds for 8 seconds. It no longer places a periodic effect on each
         target. The total amount of healing it generates in Raids should be
         approximately the same as before this change.
      
      RESTORATION CHANGES
      
      Restoration druids got a few changes as well. In Patch 5.4, a Glyph was
      introduced where you could choose to attach your [Efflorescence] to [Wild
      Mushroom], instead of to [Swiftmend]. That was a rousing success and the
      glyph was taken by nearly all Restoration druids. It felt like a much
      better situation to us, so we decided to remove the glyph, and bake that
      gameplay in permanently. [Genesis] and [Wild Mushroom: Bloom] fill a
      similar need for burst healing, so Wild Mushroom: Bloom has been removed;
      leaving Wild Mushroom to focus on the Efflorescence effect.
      
      
      Secondly, while we are fine with the playstyle where a Restoration druid
      blankets their Raid in Rejuvenations, the [Swift Rejuvenation] passive
      made that too strong, and limited their scaling with Haste. We removed
      that passive to encourage using other spells more, but still allow
      Rejuvenation blanketing as a viable playstyle. Omen of Clarity got changed
      to not trigger more often with Tree of Life as it was too strong in our
      new healing model. Soul of the Forest was also redesigned to fit better
      with Restoration and Genesis based on the new design for periodic effects.
      
      
       * Genesis has been redesigned. 
          * Genesis now consumes all of the Druid's Rejuvenation effects on
            party or raid members within 60 yards and applies the Genesis effect
            to them instead. Genesis heals the target for an amount equal to the
            remaining healing from the consumed Rejuvenation effects over 3
            seconds.
         
         
       *  [Living Seed] now heals for 50% of the critical heal (up from 30%).
       *  [Force of Nature] Treant's healing now benefits from Mastery.
       * Incarnation: Tree of Life no longer enhances Lifebloom. Instead, it
         also enhances Rejuvenation, increasing its healing by 50%, and reducing
         its cost by 30%.
       * Heart of the Wild (Restoration) now increases healing done by 35% (up
         from 25%).
       * Omen of Clarity (Restoration) can now only be triggered by the most
         recently applied Lifebloom, and now causes the next Regrowth to be
         free.
       * Soul of the Forest for Restoration Druids has been redesigned. 
          * Soul of the Forest (Restoration) when casting Swiftmend, the Druid
            gains Soul of the Forest. Soul of the Forest reduces the cast time
            of the next Healing Touch by 50%, or increases the healing of the
            next Regrowth or Rejuvenation by 100%, or increases the healing of
            the next Wild Growth by 50%.
         
         
       *  [Swift Rejuvenation] has been removed.
       *  [Wild Mushroom] (Restoration) now has a 30-second cooldown, lasts for
         30 seconds, provides periodic healing to nearby allies, and no longer
         collects Rejuvenation overhealing. 
          *  [Wild Mushroom: Bloom] has been removed.
          *  [Swiftmend] no longer causes Efflorescence.
         
         
      
      TALENTS
      
      The level 90-Talent row for druids was designed to encourage hybrid
      gameplay. We decided that, while you shouldn't have to give up a
      significant amount of your primary role throughput in order to gain the
      off-role benefit, you also don't need to gain an actual benefit to your
      primary role throughput benefit either. We've reduced the power of their
      primary role benefit, making them roughly neutral in their effect on your
      primary role. Note that the increase to off-role healing from [Nature's
      Vigil] is not actually a buff (see retuning healing spells and player
      health and resilience above).
      
      
       *  [Dream of Cenarius] 
          * Balance: The talent has been redesigned for Balance Druids and now
            causes Moonfire and Sunfire casts with Lunar or Solar Peak to also
            heal a random injured ally.
          * Feral: Increases the healing of Healing Touch and Rejuvenation by
            20%, and causes them to also heal the Druid when cast on allies.
         
         
       *  [Heart of the Wild] no longer provides an increase to Hit, Expertise,
         Stamina, Agility, and Intellect while active.
       *  [Nature's Vigil], while active, increases single-target damage and
         healing caused by healing spells by 30% (up from 25%), and all
         single-target damage spells also heal a nearby friendly target for 40%
         of the damage done (up from 25%). Its healing now targets allies within
         40 yards of the druid (instead of within 40 yards of the target).
      
      HUNTER
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning
      or consolidating class abilities.
      
      
      Hunters have lacked a strong distinction between the different
      specializations. What we mean by that is that the hunter specializations
      all had rotations that felt similar, with Marksmanship and Survival having
      the most blurred identities (Beast Mastery felt well rooted in the pet).
      Hunters were also some of the most afflicted by button bloat. To address
      these problems, we opted to make changes to each specialization's
      rotation, primarily through removing abilities, and making some of them
      unique to each spec. This means things like [Aimed Shot] being the primary
      Focus dump for Marksmanship, instead of [Arcane Shot] or [Serpent Sting] 
      being available only to Survival. Hunters also had a large number of
      cooldown abilities, which we've also cut down (some of which we moved to
      the talent tree, competing with other active buttons).
      
      
       *  [Arcane Shot] is no longer available to Marksmanship hunters. The
         talent Thrill of the Hunt received a change to preserve its value to
         Marksmanship Hunters. 
          *  [Thrill of the Hunt] now also reduces the cost of Aimed Shot when
            active, to preserve its value to Marksmanship hunters.
         
         
       *  [Aspect of the Hawk] has been removed. 
          * Aspect of the Iron Hawk has been renamed to [Iron Hawk], and now
            passively provides a 10% reduction to all damage taken.
         
         
       *  [Cower] has been removed as a pet ability.
       *  [Hunter's Mark] has been removed.
       *  [Kill Shot] is no longer available to Survival hunters.
       *  [Master Marksman] has been removed.
       *  [Piercing Shots] has been removed.
       *  [Rapid Recuperation] has been removed.
       *  [Stampede] is now a level-75 talent, replacing Lynx Rush. 
          *  [Lynx Rush] has been removed and replaced by Stampede.
         
         
       *  [Steady Focus] has been removed.
       *  [Rabid] has been removed as a pet ability.
       *  [Rapid Fire] is now available only to Marksmanship hunters.
       *  [Improved Serpent Sting] has been removed and its effects have been
         incorporated into a redesigned Serpent Sting.
       *  [Viper Venom] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated
         into a redesigned Serpent Sting.
       *  [Serpent Sting] has been redesigned based on Serpent Spread and is now
         available only to Survival hunters. 
          * Serpent Spread has been renamed into Serpent Sting.
          * Serpent Sting now causes Multi-Shot and Arcane Shot to also apply a
            Serpent Sting poison dealing instant and periodic damage.
          *  [Cobra Shot] no longer extends the duration of Serpent Sting.
         
         
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
       *  [Cobra Strikes] now has a 20% chance to trigger (up from a 15%
         chance), but now only grants 1 charge each time it triggers (down from
         2 charges).
       *  [Frenzy] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into
         Focus Fire. 
          *  [Focus Fire] now naturally grants the Hunter's pet the ability to
            gain Frenzy.
         
         
       *  [Go for the Throat] has been removed and its effects have been
         incorporated into Invigoration. 
          *  [Invigoration] now also grants 15 Focus to the Hunter's pet from
            auto-shot Critical Strikes.
         
         
       *  [The Beast Within] has been removed and its effects have been
         incorporated into Bestial Wrath. 
          *  [Bestial Wrath] now naturally includes the effects of The Beast
            Within.
         
         
       *  [Lock and Load]'s effects have been incorporated into Black Arrow.
       *  [Black Arrow]'s cooldown is reset if it is dispelled.
       *  [Mend Pet] and [Revive Pet] now share the same button and changes
         based on the condition of the Hunter's pet.
       *  [Thrill of the Hunt] now has a 6% chance to trigger for every 10 Focus
         spent (instead of a flat 30% chance).
      
      ROTATION DEPTH AND TALENTS
      
      We've changed the combat rotations of each hunter specialization
      (primarily through ability pruning) with the goal of them being a platform
      to build upon with talents. To facilitate this, we've modified several
      talents to add additional rotational depth. Hunters had many talent
      options which added abilities to their rotation, but most of them had
      quite simple usage, with little interaction with your rotation or other
      abilities. Now, there should be more of a variety; still some simple
      talents, but also some talents that create a more engaging combat
      rotation.
      
      
       *  [Barrage] now has a 20 second cooldown (down from 30 seconds), costs
         60 Focus (up from 30 Focus), and its damage has been increased by 100%.
       *  [A Murder of Crows] has been changed. Its duration, cost, and cooldown
         have been reduced by 50%. It no longer has a shorter cooldown when used
         on low health targets. Instead, its cooldown is reset if the target
         dies.
       *  [Fervor] has been replaced with a new passive ability, Steady Focus. 
          *  [Steady Focus] increases Focus Regeneration by 50% for 10 seconds
            after using Cobra Shot or Steady Shot twice in a row, or after using
            Focusing Shot.
         
         
       *  [Dire Beast] now restores 2 Focus per hit (down from 5 Focus per hit).
      
      ASPECTS
      
      One of the most difficult abilities to decide to cut was [Aspect of the
      Hawk]. It began to feel fairly meaningless, since it was used virtually
      all of the time in combat, so might as well have just been passive. We
      decided to cut Aspect of the Hawk, and bake in its benefit to the other
      abilities. The remaining aspect abilities are all utility only, and are
      being moved off the stance bar and made toggles.
      
      
      Overall, hunters should see a drastic reduction in the number of active
      buttons, and have a clearer distinction between the different
      specializations. With some of these changes, you may find yourself
      favoring a different specialization. Keep in mind that Draenor Perks,
      earned from levels 91 to 99, will serve to further distinguish the
      different specializations.
      
      
       *  [Aspect of the Cheetah] and [Aspect of the Pack] both now share a
         10-second cooldown and no longer appears on the stance bar.
       *  [Glyph of Aspect of the Beast]: The ability taught by this Glyph no
         longer appears on the stance bar and is now on the global cooldown.
       *  [Glyph of Aspect of the Cheetah]: No longer triggers any cooldown on
         Aspects.
      
      MARKSMANSHIP CHANGES
      
      One of our new secondary stats, Multistrike, is strikingly similar to the
      Wild Quiver Mastery for Marksmanship hunters. To address this similarity,
      we replaced Wild Quiver with a new Mastery: Sniper Training. Marksmanship
      hunters that favored Mastery before will want to favor Multistrike for a
      similar feel. For their new Mastery, we wanted to add some depth to their
      moment-to-moment gameplay, and compliment Critical Strike. In order to do
      that, we brought back the concept of Sniper Training.
      
      
      We also changed the design of Chimera Shot (and fixed its name), in order
      to better capture the intended flavor. Finally, we added an interaction
      between Careful Aim and Rapid Fire (and indirectly Aimed Shot through a
      Draenor Perk), so as to add a bit more depth to their gameplay.
      
      
       *  [Bombardment] now reduces the cost of Multi-Shot by 25 Focus (up from
         a 20 Focus reduction to cost).
       * Mastery: [Wild Quiver] has been removed.
       * Sniper Training is a new Mastery for Marksmanship Hunters, replacing
         Wild Quiver. 
          * Sniper Training activates when the Hunter stands still for 3
            seconds, giving them the Sniper Training effect for 6 seconds,
            increasing damage, shot range, and critical strike damage by 4%
            (increased by Mastery).
         
         
       * Chimera Shot has been renamed [Chimaera Shot]. It is now a two-headed
         shot that hits two targets, costs 35 Focus (down from 45 Focus), and
         deals Frost or Nature damage, but no longer heals the hunter.
       *  [Careful Aim] now also provides its effect against all targets when
         Rapid Fire is active, and increases critical strike chance by 60% (down
         from 75%).
      
      SURVIVAL CHANGES
      
      Apart from rotational changes through Ability Pruning, changes for
      Survival hunters mostly center on Lock and Load. We changed how Lock and
      Load is triggered to increase the value of Multistrike, provide gameplay
      depth and the ability to pool damage more. Also note the new passive
      ability, Survivalist, which increases multistrike chance by 10%, in order
      to give Survival Hunters some baseline Multistrike chance.
      
      
       *  [Explosive Shot] now costs 15 Focus (down from 25 Focus).
       *  [Survivalist] is a new passive ability learned by Survival hunters at
         level 10. 
          * Survivalist increases Multistrike damage by 20%, and causes the
            hunter to gain 15% health over 10 seconds after killing a target.
         
         
      
      HUNTER PET ABILITIES
      
      We did a comprehensive pass on hunter pet abilities. As mentioned above in 
      crowd control and diminishing returns, all full crowd-control abilities
      have been removed from Hunter pets and replaced those with new abilities,
      including spreading some that were previously restricted to exotic pets.
      Additionally, hunters can now tame beasts from new pet families.
      
      
       * Several raid buffs provided by hunter pets have been changed into auras
         that are automatically applied to the Hunter's party or raid.
       * Abilities unique to each hunter pet family have been revised to provide
         a standard buff, debuff, or ability. 
          * Combat Resurrection ability: Crane, Moth, Quilen
          * Mortal Wounds debuff: Carrion Bird, Devilsaur, Riverbeast, Scorpid
          * Increased Spell Power buff: Serpent, Silithid, Water Strider
          * Increased Strength/Agility/Intellect buff: Dog, Gorilla, Shale
            Spider, Worm
          * Increased Critical Strike Chance buff: Devilsaur, Quilen, Raptor,
            Shale Spider, Water Strider, Wolf
          * Temporary Haste buff: Core Hound, Nether Ray
          * Increased Haste buff: Rylak, Hyena, Sporebat, Wasp
          * Increased Mastery buff: Cat, Hydra, Spirit Beast, Tallstrider
          * Increased Stamina buff: Bear, Goat, Rylak, Silithid
          * Increased Multistrike buff: Basilisk, Chimaera, Core Hound,
            Dragonhawk, Fox, Rhino, Wind Serpent
          * Increased Versatility buff: Bird of Prey, Boar, Porcupine, Ravager,
            Rhino, Worm
          * An ability that increases dodge chance of the pet by 30% for 10
            seconds: Bat, Monkey
          * An ability that reduces damage taken by the pet by 50% for 12
            seconds: Beetle, Crab, Quilen, Rhino, Shale Spider, Turtle
          * An ability that Reduces the movement speed of the target by 50%:
            Chimaera, Crocolisk, Silithid, Spider, Warp Stalker
          * The following pet families provide an ability that puts the pet in
            stealth mode, slowing its movement speed by 50%. The first attack
            from stealth receives a 20% bonus to damage: Cat, Spirit Beast
          * The following pet families provide an additional ability. 
             * Chimaera - [Froststorm Breath]: Causes Froststorm damage to all
               targets in front of the Chimaera over 8 seconds.
             * Core Hound - [Molten Hide]: Causes Fire damage to attackers.
             * Devilsaur - [Feast]: The devilsaur feasts on a nearby Humanoid or
               Beast corpse within 5 yards, healing it for 20% of its maximum
               health and restoring 20 focus over 5 seconds.
             * Direhorn - [Reflective Armor Plating]: Deflects all spells cast
               in front of the Direhorn for 6 seconds.
             * Rylak - [Updraft]: Slows the fall speed of both itself and the
               hunter for 30 seconds.
             * Spirit Beast - [Spirit Mend]: Heals the target ally instantly,
               and additional healing over 10 seconds.
             * Water Strider - [Surface Trot]: Allows the Hunter and the Water
               Strider to walk across water.
             * Worm - [Burrow Attack]: Deals Nature damage to nearby enemies
               over 8 seconds.
            
            
         
         
      
      MISCELLANEOUS
      
      There were also a few other changes, primarily for quality of life and
      rotational consistency.
      
      
       *  [Aimed Shot] no longer interrupts Auto Attacks, and can be cast while
         moving.
       *  [Dismiss Pet] now ignores line of sight.
       *  [Explosive Trap] now places a periodic-damage effect on each target
         within the radius of the explosion, rather than a persistent effect on
         the ground.
       *  [Growl] now has a 30-yard range.
       * Hunter pets now have a 1-second global cooldown.
      
      MAGE
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section for discussion of why we're pruning class
      abilities. For mages, we removed several of the unused and niche abilities
      from each specialization that didn't use them primarily.
      
      
       *  [Arcane Barrage] replaces Fire Blast for Arcane mages.
       *  [Arcane Blast] now replaces Frostfire Bolt for Arcane mages.
       *  [Arcane Explosion] is now available only to Arcane mages.
       *  [Blizzard] is now available only to Frost mages.
       *  [Conjure Mana Gem] has been removed.
       *  [Evocation] is now available only to Arcane mages.
       *  [Flamestrike] is now available only to Fire mages.
       *  [Ice Lance] replaces Fire Blast and is now only available to Frost
         mages.
       *  [Pyromaniac] has been removed.
       *  [Shatter] is now available only to Frost mages.
       *  [Mage Armor] is now a passive effect and is available only to Arcane
         mages.
       *  [Frost Armor] is now a passive effect and is available only to Frost
         mages.
       *  [Molten Armor] is now a passive effect and is available only to Fire
         mages.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Most of the mage abilities required little consolidation. The most notable
      change here is turning Armor spells into passive abilities for each
      specialization.
      
      
       *  [Mage Armor] is now a passive effect and is available only to Arcane
         mages.
       *  [Frost Armor] is now a passive effect and is available only to Frost
         mages.
       *  [Molten Armor] is now a passive effect and is available only to Fire
         mages.
       *  [Combustion] no longer deals direct damage or stuns.
       *  [Frostbolt] can no longer be used to heal the mage's Water Elemental.
       *  [Ice Floes] no longer has a restriction on base cast or channel times
         for spells (formerly only worked on spells with a base cast or channel
         time of less than 4 seconds).
       * Ignite now deals the same total damage with a 1 second period (down
         from 2 seconds). Base duration changed to 5 seconds so that duration
         when refreshed remains 6 seconds.
       *  [Mirror Image] is now a level-90 Talent, replacing [Invocation].
       *  [Polymorph] variants except for Polymorph: Sheep are now all learned
         as spells and grouped in a flyout on the Spellbook instead of being a
         Minor Glyph that alters the visuals of Polymorph: Sheep.
      
      TALENT REVISIONS
      
      The mage class has good specialization distinction when it comes to their
      single-target rotations, but utility and area-of-effect spells were
      heavily shared between specializations. Commonly, these spells were
      redundant as well. We made many of their spells specialization-specific
      (as described in ability pruning above). And probably most significant, we
      made changes to several existing talents.
      
      
       [Presence of Mind] was extremely strong for instant crowd control (CC),
      which we wanted to curtail. Rather than completely remove Presence of
      Mind, we made it a base Arcane spell and a new talent in its place, 
      [Evanesce]. At first, it may seem out of place for Evanesce to be on a
      movement-focused talent row. In practice, it offers Mages the option to
      remain stationary instead of moving away from avoidable damage.
      
      
       *  [Presence of Mind] is no longer a talent, and is now learned by only
         Arcane mages.
       *  [Evanesce] is a new talent available at level 15, replacing Presence
         of Mind. 
          * Evanesce causes the mage to fade into the nether, avoiding all
            attacks for 3 seconds. This spell has a 45-second cooldown, replaces
            Ice Block, is not on global cooldown, and may be cast while a
            cast-time spell is in progress.
         
         
      
      
      Going along with our goals to reduce cooldown stacking across all of the
      classes, we decided to remove [Alter Time]'s DPS contribution. Alter Time
      has a number of clever movement and utility uses, but in practice it was
      mostly being used for additional uptime of offensive cooldowns. mages also
      had many redundant forms of survival utility, so we moved a utility-only
      version of Alter Time into the talent tree, replacing [Temporal Shield].
      
      
       *  [Temporal Shield] has been removed and replaced by Alter Time.
       *  [Alter Time] is now a level-30 Talent, replacing Temporal Shield. 
          * Alter Time now lasts for 10 seconds (up from 6 seconds), has a
            90-second cooldown (down from 3 minutes), and no longer affects the
            mage's mana, buffs, or debuffs.
         
         
      
      
      A few of the abilities reset by Cold Snap were made spec-specific, or
      could be overridden with talents, so we expanded what it can affect to
      compensate.
      
      
       *  [Cold Snap] now also resets the cooldown of [Presence of Mind], 
         [Dragon's Breath], and [Evanesce].
      
      
      Ice Ward was changed to make it more competitive with the rest of its
      talent row.
      
      
       *  [Ice Ward] now causes the next 3 attackers (up from 1) to trigger a
         Frost Nova.
      
      
      The [Mage Bomb] level-75 Talent row, the bomb row, was also problematic.
      We chose to add the bombs to all mages' rotations in order to spice them
      up a bit, to provide rotational variety. That succeeded, and we're overall
      happy with how they interact with your rotation in a single-target
      situation, but they also came with the prospect of multi-dotting (applying
      your damage-over-time spell to many enemies, individually), which we don't
      feel is an appropriate fit for mages. Additionally, in order to make all 3
      bombs useful to all specializations, we had to lose some of their
      spec-specific perks. And, even more importantly, many mages did not like
      DoT gameplay at all.
      
      
      In order to solve all of these problems, we decided to merge the 3 current
      bomb talents into one that changes based on spec. That allows us to
      reintroduce spec-specific perks to each bomb, and makes room for some
      non-DoT alternatives.
      
      
       *  [Nether Tempest], [Living Bomb], and [Frost Bomb] now all share the
         left-talent slot and is available based on the mage's specialization. 
          * Frost Bomb has been redesigned. 
             * Frost Bomb now lasts 12 seconds, has no cooldown, and explodes
               every time the target is hit by the mage's [Ice Lance] while
               frozen. The damage per explosion has been reduced by 75% to
               compensate.
            
            
          * Living Bomb can once again be applied to multiple targets, can be
            spread by [Inferno Blast], and has a 1.5-second cooldown. More of
            its damage has been moved into its explosion.
          * Nether Tempest can now only be on 1 target at a time (down from
            unlimited), but its secondary damage now hits all targets in range
            (up from only 1), deals 100% of the primary damage (up from 50%),
            and its damage can now be increased by Arcane Charges.
         
         
       *  [Unstable Magic] is a new talent that's available at level 75, and
         occupies the middle-talent slot. 
          * Unstable Magic causes [Arcane Blast], [Fireball], and [Frostbolt] 
            have a chance to explode on impact, dealing an additional 50% damage
            to the target, and all other enemies within 8 yards.
         
         
       * The right-talent slot for level 75 has a new Talent that varies by
         specialization. 
          *  [Blast Wave]: Cause an explosion of fiery force around the target
            enemy or ally, dealing Fire damage to all enemies within 8 yards,
            and dazing them, reducing their movement speed by 70% for 4 seconds.
            If the primary target is an enemy, they take 100% increased damage.
            Replaces [Frost Nova]. Instant cast ability with a 25-second
            cooldown and 2 charges.
          *  [Ice Nova]: Cause a whirl of icy wind around the target enemy or
            ally, dealing Frost damage to all enemies within 8 yards, and
            freezing them for 4 seconds. If the primary target is an enemy, they
            take 100% increased damage. Replaces [Frost Nova]. Instant cast
            ability with a 20-second cooldown and 2 charges.
          *  [Supernova]: Cause a pulse of Arcane energy around the target enemy
            or ally, dealing Arcane damage to all enemies within 8 yards, and
            knocking them into the air. If the primary target is an enemy, they
            take 100% increased damage. Replaces [Frost Nova]. Instant cast
            ability with a 25-second cooldown and 2 charges.
         
         
      
      
      One of the most problematic Talent rows in the game has been the mage
      level-90 row. The primary theme of the row was mana, which only Arcane
      mages actually cared about. Bonus damage was added in, making it
      functional for all mages, but muddled in its goals. Additionally, some of
      them just weren't fun to play with. We've revised the row to be purely
      about damage, and made them have less maintenance cost. Arcane mages will
      have enough mana regeneration without these talents to perform well.
      
      
       *  [Incanter's Ward] has been removed and replaced by Incanter's Flow, a
         new level-90 Talent. 
          *  [Incanter's Flow]: Magical energy flows through you, increasing all
            spell damage done by 5% per stack. While in combat, the magical
            energy builds up to 5 stacks over 5 seconds and then diminishes down
            to 1 stack over 5 seconds. This cycle repeats every 10 seconds.
         
         
       *  [Invocation] has been removed and replaced by Mirror Image.
       *  [Mirror Image] is now a level-90 Talent, replacing Invocation. Mirror
         Images now inherit 100% of the mage's Spell Power (up from 5%), last 40
         seconds (up from 30 seconds), and have a 2-minute cooldown (down from 3
         minutes). 
          *  [Glyph of Mirror Image] has been removed and its effects have been
            incorporated into Mirror Image.
         
         
       *  [Rune of Power] no longer replaces Evocation, no longer increases mana
         regeneration, and now lasts 3 minutes (up from 1 minute).
      
      FROST CHANGES
      
      Frost mages enjoyed newfound PvE viability in Mists of Pandaria, and we
      intend to continue that into the future. However, we do want to clean up
      some rough spots, especially around their valuing of secondary stats, and
      the amount of instant-cast spells in their rotation. The [Frost Armor] and 
      [Shatter] changes increase the amount of Haste/Critical chance that they
      can acquire on gear before they start hitting soft caps. The Shatter
      change also lowers the value of Critical Strike for a bit. The changes to
      the level-75 Talent row meant that having a Bomb spell is no longer
      guaranteed, so we changed the way that [Brain Freeze] is triggered. Ice
      Lance's non-frozen damage was doubled to make up for no longer having
      access to Fire Blast and reducing redundancy in the process.
      
      
       *  [Frost Armor] now grants an 8% chance to Multistrike instead of 7%
         Haste.
       *  [Shatter] now multiplies Critical Strike chance by 1.5 (down from 2).
       * The [Brain Freeze] effect now increases [Frostfire Bolt]'s damage by
         25%, and can now stack up to 2 times. It also no longer triggers from
         the bomb talents, and instead has a 10% chance to trigger from 
         [Frostbolt] casts. Each Multistrike of Frostbolt increases that cast's
         chance by an additional 25%. (Total of 60% on double-Multistrikes).
       *  [Ice Lance]'s base damage has been increased by 100%, but its damage
         multiplier against frozen targets has been reduced by 50%.
       *  [Fingers of Frost] now increases Ice Lance damage by 100% (up from
         25%).
       *  [Glyph of Frostfire Bolt] is now available only to Fire mages.
       *  [Glyph of Icy Veins] now causes [Icy Veins] to provide 35% chance to
         Multistrike instead of 20% Haste.
      
      FIRE CHANGES
      
      Fire mage's rotation is looking solid with the new Draenor Perks. However,
      their cooldown strength could use a buff.
      
      
       *  [Combustion]'s damage has been increased by 100% and replaces Deep
         Freeze for Fire mages.
      
      ARCANE CHANGES
      
      In order to make room for more Haste effects to apply to [Arcane Blast],
      we raised its cast time and damage slightly. We also made Arcane Charges 
      last longer, to aid in questing and encounters.
      
      
       *  [Arcane Blast]'s cast time has been increased to 2.25 seconds (up from
         2 seconds), damage has been increased by 12.5% to compensate.
       * Arcane Charges now last 15 seconds (up from 10 seconds), and increases
         mana cost by 100% (down from 150%).
       *  [Arcane Missiles] can now accumulate 3 charges (up from 2 charges).
      
      MONK
      
      The brand-new class for Mists of Pandaria, monks, turned out to be a ton
      of fun. Brewmasters stayed fairly solid all expansion long. Windwalkers
      needed a few tweaks here and there, especially to their Mastery, and still
      have a few shortcomings that we hope to improve, but overall worked quite
      well. Mistweavers had a bit of a rollercoaster ride, veering between weak
      and strong over the course of the expansion. Most of our changes to monks
      will focus on Mistweavers, to try to get them just right.
      
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning
      class abilities. For monks, the pruning focused on niche abilities. One
      removal of note is that of Healing Sphere. The active ability to place a
      Healing Sphere was particularly awkward to use, but overpowered if used
      perfectly. So we removed it, and replaced it with Healing Surge for
      Windwalkers and Brewmasters.
      
      
       *  [Avert Harm] has been removed.
       *  [Clash] has been removed.
       *  [Dematerialize] has been removed.
       * Power Guard has been removed.
       *  [Sparring] has been removed.
       *  [Spinning Fire Blossom] has been removed.
       *  [Stance of the Sturdy Ox] now replaces Stance of the Fierce Tiger for
         Brewmaster Monks.
       *  [Stance of the Spirited Crane] now replaces Stance of the Fierce Tiger
         for Mistweaver Monks.
       *  [Swift Reflexes] has been removed.
       *  [Zen Meditation] is no longer available to Mistweaver Monks.
       *  [Healing Sphere] has been removed. Abilities that can summon Healing
         Spheres, [Mastery: Gift of the Serpent] (Mistweavers), Gift of the Ox
         (Brewmasters), and Afterlife (Windwalkers) can still summon Healing
         Spheres. 
          *  [Surging Mist] is now available to all monk specializations. It
            costs 30 Energy in Ox or Tiger Stance, and continues to cost mana in
            Serpent Stance and Crane Stance. However, it only generates Chi for
            Mistweaver Monks.
         
         
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Monk ability consolidation is fairly straightforward. It includes merging
      of some passive abilities, and removing unneeded abilities that didn't
      create the gameplay depth they had been intended to.
      
      
       *  [Teachings of the Monastery] has been removed. Its effects modifying
         Spinning Crane Kick has been incorporated into Stance of the Wise
         Serpent.
       *  [Brewmaster Training] has been removed. Its effects have been
         incorporated into Stance of the Sturdy Ox.
       *  [Desperate Measures] has been removed. Its effects have been
         incorporated into Stance of the Sturdy Ox.
       *  [Combo Breaker] has been removed. Its effects have been incorporated
         into Stance of the Fierce Tiger.
       *  [Combat Conditioning] has been removed. Its effects have been
         incorporated into Stance of the Fierce Tiger.
       *  [Fortifying Brew] now lasts 15 seconds (down from 20 seconds).
       *  [Power Strikes] now triggers every 15 seconds (up from every 20
         seconds), and also triggers from Surging Mist (for Mistweavers only),
         but no longer triggers from Crackling Jade Lightning.
       *  [Resuscitate]'s mana cost has been reduced by 80%.
       *  [Spinning Crane Kick] now always generates 1 Chi, and no longer
         reduces movement speed.
       *  [Paralysis] now always lasts 60 seconds against creatures, regardless
         of facing.
       *  [Disable] is now available only to Windwalker monks.
       *  [Uplift] now follows standard area-of-effect capping rules,
         diminishing in effectiveness beyond 6 targets.
       *  [Zen Meditation] is no longer available to Mistweaver monks, and no
         longer redirects harmful spells cast against party and raid members.
       *  [Zen Sphere] no longer has a target limit.
      
      MISTWEAVER CHANGES
      
      About midway through the expansion, it became clear that mana was not
      valuable for Mistweavers. We tried some adjustments to solve that, but it
      proved too large of a change to make at the time. We chose to just live
      with that problem for the time being, and tune them around not really
      caring much about Spirit or mana (once they reached epic gear).
      
      
      Now that we have the time to tweak things for Mistweavers to acquire new
      gear, we're making changes to get them in the right spot. Initially, we
      experimented with giving Mistwavers a 1-second global cooldown (GCD) akin
      to that of the rogue to give them a faster combat feel. However, it's
      proven difficult to balance. Haste is attractive to healers because it
      lowers not just cast time but GCD as well. Therefore, monks valued Haste
      much less than other healers. We explored a few options, but ultimately
      landed on changing the core GCD for Mistweavers from 1 second to the
      standard 1.5 seconds, which you will be able to reduce with Haste. This
      will feel jarring at first, but we're confident that it's for the best,
      long-term.
      
      
       * All abilities available to Mistweavers now have a 1.5-second global
         cooldown (up from 1 second). 
          *  [Stance of the Fierce Tiger] now reduces the global cooldown of the
            Mistweaver monk's abilities by 0.5 seconds.
          *  [Stance of the Sturdy Ox] now reduces the global cooldown of the
            Mistweaver monk's abilities by 0.5 seconds.
         
         
       *  [Focus and Harmony] is a new passive ability for Mistweaver monks,
         causing Haste to reduce the global cooldown, and causes Attack Power to
         be equal to 100% of Spell Power. 
          * Stance of the Wise Serpent no longer provides this Spell Power to
            Attack Power conversion.
         
         
       *  [Crackling Jade Lightning]'s throughput has been increased by 100%,
         but it no longer generates Chi for Mistweaver monks. Additionally, it
         is free in Stance of the Wise Serpent.
       *  [Chi Brew] now grants 1 charge of Mana Tea (down from 2 charges).
       *  [Ascension] now increases maximum Mana by 20% (up from 15%).
       *  [Detonate Chi] is a new spell available to Mistweaver monks, instantly
         detonating all Healing Spheres, and causing each of them to heal a
         nearby ally within 12 yards of the sphere with a 15-second cooldown.
       * Healing Spheres now heal an ally within 12 yards (up from 6 yards) for
         100% (up from 50%) of their normal healing, when they expire.
       * Gift of the Serpent chance to trigger has increased significantly for
         various Mistweaver spells, conferring a larger percentage of the
         maximum value.
       *  [Renewing Mist] now jumps to the most injured target in range.
       *  [Soothing Mist]'s healing has been increased by 100%, its GCD has been
         reduced to 0.5 seconds, but no longer heals immediately, and no longer
         generates Chi.
       *  [Stance of the Wise Serpent] no longer increases Haste from items by
         50%.
       *  [Summon Jade Serpent Statue] now has a 10-second cooldown (down from
         30 seconds).
       *  [Thunder Focus Tea] no longer costs Chi, causes the next [Renewing
         Mist] to jump up to 4 times (instead of causing the next [Uplift] to
         refresh the duration of Renewing Mists on all targets). Its effect on
         Surging Mist remains unchanged.
       *  [Jade Mists] is a new passive ability for Mistweaver monks, causing
         them to gain 5% more of the Multistrike stat from all sources, and also
         causes Renewing Mist and Rising Sun Kick to have a chance equal to
         Multistrike chance to not go on cooldown when used. This effect cannot
         trigger on the next Renewing Mist or Rising Sun Kick.
      
      
      Another issue with Mistweavers is that of [Eminence], which has never
      really played out how we had hoped. The intent with Eminence was to create
      an alternate play style to fulfill the fantasy of healing through dealing
      damage, since we knew a lot of players had that fantasy, and a new class
      was the perfect opportunity to satisfy that.
      
      
      Having two play styles in one spec (Eminence, and traditional Mistweaving,
      healing primarily through casting heals) proved challenging to balance,
      because we don't want players to take the best parts of both and stack
      them into an unintended superior spec. The most notorious of these cases
      was " [Jab]-Jab- [Uplift]". In order to solve this problem, we're giving
      Mistweavers two stances. Stance of the Wise Serpent will continue to be
      the stance from which to do traditional Mistweaving. The new [Stance of
      the Spirited Crane] will be the stance to use for Eminence. You can swap
      stances at will, with only the cost of a GCD and any current Chi that
      you've accrued. The intention is that Crane Stance allows Mistweavers to
      trade healing for damage; it should fall somewhere in the middle between
      being a full healer, and being a full damage dealer.
      
      
       *  [Stance of the Spirited Crane] is a new ability for Mistweaver monks,
         which replaces [Stance of the Fierce Tiger], and provides the following
         effects. 
          * The monk gains [Eminence], causing all damage dealt to also heal
            nearby allies. 
             * Eminence now causes a nearby target to be healed for 50% of all
               damage caused by the monk and includes auto attacks.
             * Stance of the Wise Serpent no longer provides this benefit.
            
            
          *  [Crackling Jade Lightning] channels 150% faster, generates 1 Chi
            each time it deals damage, but costs 300% more mana.
          * Blackout Kicks grants Crane's Zeal, increasing Critical Strike
            chance by 20% for 20 seconds.
          *  [Blackout Kick] causes Eminence to heal 5 allies instead of 1, but
            heals for only 20% of damage dealt instead of 35%.
          * The monk gains a stack of Vital Mists for every Chi consumed. Vital
            Mists reduces the cast time and Mana cost of the next Surging Mist
            by 20% per stack up to a maximum of 5 stacks.
          *  [Muscle Memory] has been removed.
          * Serpent's Zeal has been removed.
          * Vital Mists has been removed.
         
         
       *  [Rising Sun Kick] is now available to Mistweaver and Windwalker monks.
         However, it does not cause Mortal Wounds for Mistweavers. 
          *  [Stance of the Fierce Tiger] now causes Rising Sun Kick to cause
            Mortal Wounds, instead of it causing Mortal Wounds naturally.
         
         
       * The following abilities now require [Stance of the Wise Serpent] for
         Mistweavers: 
          *  [Enveloping Mist], [Renewing Mist], [Soothing Mist], [Uplift]
         
         
       * The following abilities now require [Stance of the Spirited Crane] for
         Mistweavers: 
          *  [Blackout Kick], [Jab], Rising Sun Kick, [Tiger Palm]
         
         
      
      HEALING SPHERES
      
      Healing Spheres have been improved. You'll no longer waste them when
      running over multiples at once when you only need a little healing. We
      significantly improved the Mistweavers' Healing Spheres effect when they
      expire. We also made [Afterlife]'s Healing Spheres consistent with the
      rest of the class.
      
      
       * When a player runs through multiple Healing Spheres at once, only as
         many as needed to heal the player to full health will be consumed
         (instead of all of them if the player is injured at all).
       * Healing Spheres summoned by Mastery: Gift of the Serpent (Mistweaver)
         now heal an injured ally within 12 yards (up from 6 yards) for 100% (up
         from 50%) of their normal effect when they expire, and scales with
         Spell Power instead of Attack Power.
       * Healing Spheres summoned by Afterlife (Windwalkers) now heals for the
         same amount as other Healing Spheres (instead of healing for 15% of
         maximum health).
       * Healing Spheres generated from Gift of the Ox now heals the Monk if
         they are within 6 yards of the sphere when it expires.
      
      SHARED ABILITY CHANGES
      
      There were several changes that affected multiple monk specializations.
      We'd like to see monks using [Transcendence] more often, so its usability
      has been improved (some baseline, and some in a Draenor Perk). For [Touch
      of Death], we like that it's a unique execute being usable only once, but
      found it impractical to use on bosses and have improved its usability. For 
      [Tiger Strikes], we buffed it to grant Multistrike ability which it was
      similar to already, and extended it to work with all monk specializations.
      To better balance the damage of Brewmaster versus Windwalker where both
      share many of the same abilities, we removed the damage increase provided
      by Tiger Stance, and increased the damage of melee abilities to
      compensate.
      
      
       *  [Chi Brew] now has a 60 second recharge time (up from 45 seconds).
       *  [Stance of the Fierce Tiger] now also includes the benefits of Combo
         Breaker and Combat Conditioning, and is replaced by another stance for
         Brewmaster and Mistweaver Monks. 
          * Brewmaster: Stance of the Sturdy Ox replaces Stance of the Fierce
            Tiger.
          * Mistweaver: Stance of the Spirited Crane replaces Stance of the
            Fierce Tiger.
         
         
       *  [Tiger Strikes] is now available to all monk specializations, and has
         a chance to trigger on successful auto attacks and their Multistrikes.
         It has a 10% chance to trigger while using a two-handed weapon, and a
         5% chance to trigger while dual wielding. 
          * When triggered, Tiger Strikes now grants a 25% increase to
            Multistrike for 8 seconds instead of a 50% increase to attack speed
            and double attacks for 4 attacks.
         
         
       *  [Touch of Death] is no longer available to Mistweaver monks, and is
         usable on targets that have 10% or less health remaining, or have less
         current health than your maximum health. The rules against players
         remain unchanged.
       *  [Transcendence: Transfer] no longer has an energy or mana cost.
      
      WINDWALKER CHANGES
      
      For Energy-based gameplay to function well, the primary limitation on
      ability usage should be Energy, not time. That breaks down when a rotation
      becomes limited by available GCDs, rather than by Energy. Windwalkers were
      hitting this "GCD-cap" too easily, causing scaling problems as they geared
      up, and removing rotational choices. To solve this problem, we’ve made a
      few tweaks that will slow down their rotation slightly; but still allow
      Windwalkers who enjoy the GCD-capped playstyle to have options available
      to focus on Haste and Energy regeneration. Individually, these may sound
      like significant nerfs, but Windwalker damage has been adjusted to
      compensate for these changes. The goal is to address the issue with
      GCD-capping while not reducing DPS.
      
      
       *  [Combo Breaker] now has an 8% chance to trigger, per effect, per Jab
         (down from 12%).
       *  [Jab] now costs 45 Energy while in Stance of the Fierce Tiger.
      
      
      There are a couple of additional changes for Windwalkers. [Storm, Earth,
      and Fire], got buffed to make it smoother to use. We also buffed [Fists of
      Fury] because we felt that the ability wasn't giving a strong enough
      damage boost given its restrictions and impact on the Monk's rotation.
      
      
       *  [Fists of Fury] now deals 100% increased damage, and always deals full
         damage to the primary target; additional targets are still affected by
         the damage split.
       *  [Storm, Earth, and Fire] no longer has an energy cost, and is off
         global cooldown.
      
      BREWMASTER CHANGES
      
      For Brewmasters, [Gift of the Ox] has been modified to allow it to scale
      defensively with the new Multistrike stat. The Black Ox Statue has been
      modified to aid Monks in establishing threat on new enemies instead of
      shielding allies. We also removed the Misfire effect, as it did not live
      up to its original idea, and was unnecessary.
      
      
       *  [Summon Black Ox Statue] no longer casts Guard on allies and now has a
         10-second cooldown (down from 30 seconds). Black Ox Statue now
         passively attracts the attention of all enemies within 30 yards,
         causing a minor amount of threat each second.
       *  [Dizzying Haze] now has no Energy cost, but no longer causes the
         target's melee attacks to sometimes misfire.
       *  [Elusive Brew] now increases dodge chance by 45% (up from 30%).
       *  [Gift of the Ox] now has a chance to trigger only from auto attack
         Multistrikes, instead of from all auto attacks. It has a 100% chance to
         trigger while using a two-handed weapon, and a 62.5% chance to trigger
         while dual wielding.
       *  [Stance of the Sturdy Ox] now increases Stamina by 25% (up from 20%),
         reduces magic damage taken by 10% (down from all damage taken by 25%),
         and grants a 50% increase to Armor, but no longer increases Energy
         regeneration.
       * Shuffle now increases Stagger and Parry by 10% (down from 20%).
      
      PALADIN
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning
      class abilities. For paladins, the pruning focused on removing niche
      abilities, and trimming cooldowns.
      
      
       *  [Avenging Wrath] is no longer available to Protection paladins.
       *  [Divine Favor] has been removed.
       *  [Divine Plea] has been removed. Mana costs for paladins have been
         adjusted accordingly.
       *  [Guardian of Ancient Kings] is now only available to Protection
         paladins.
       *  [Hand of Salvation] is now only available to Protection paladins.
       *  [Holy Light] has been removed.
       *  [Inquisition] has been removed.
       *  [Seal of Righteousness] is no longer available to Holy paladins.
       *  [Seal of Truth] is no longer available to Holy paladins.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      There were a few mergers of passive abilities, and some tweaks to a couple
      of abilities.
      
      
       * Divine Light has been renamed Holy Light.
       *  [Divine Protection] now lasts 8 seconds (down from 10 seconds).
       *  [Guardian of Ancient Kings] now lasts 8 seconds (down from 12
         seconds).
       *  [Daybreak] now heals all allies within 10 yards for 15% of Holy
         Shock's healing (instead of 75%, split between each ally).
       *  [Grand Crusader] now triggers from any avoidance, not just dodge and
         parry.
       *  [Hand of Sacrifice] is now off global-cooldown.
       *  [Judgment] is now naturally free for Holy paladins, and naturally
         generates 1 Holy Power for Protection and Retribution paladins. 
          *  [Judgments of the Bold] has been removed.
         
         
       *  [Redemption]'s mana cost has been reduced by 95%.
       *  [Selfless Healer] no longer causes Bastion of Glory to apply to Flash
         of Light. For Holy paladins, it now increases the healing of Flash of
         Light on others by 35% per stack (up from 20%). For Retribution and
         Protection paladins, the effect on Flash of Light remains unchanged.
       *  [Sword of Light] now increases damage by 25% (down from 30%).
       *  [The Art of War]'s effects have been merged into baseline Exorcism.
      
      HOLY CHANGES
      
      We made several changes for Holy, to go along with other larger system
      changes to compensate for the removal of [Guardian of Ancient Kings] from
      Holy, and merged its benefits into [Divine Favor]. In order to follow
      through on our change to merge all types of Haste %, we removed the Spell
      Haste % from [Seal of Insight] to a Holy-only passive, so that it didn't
      also increase Protection's baseline Haste by 10%. Our changes to healer
      mana and mobility also indirectly increased the value of [Selfless Healer] 
      by a large amount, so we brought it back down to be even in power with the
      other talents on its row. We also raised the range of [Denounce] to be
      consistent with other spells. Lastly, we adjusted the critical strike
      chance of [Holy Shock], to increase the value of Critical Strike for Holy
      paladins.
      
      
       *  [Avenging Wrath] now also increases all of the paladin's healing by
         20% for its duration.
       *  [Beacon of Light] now has a small Mana cost.
       *  [Denounce]'s range has increased to 40 yards (up from 30 yards).
       *  [Holy Shock] now has twice the normal chance to critically strike
         (instead of having an additional 25% chance to critically strike).
       *  [Infusion of Light] now also passively increases Haste by 10%.
       *  [Seal of Insight] no longer increases spell Haste by 10%.
       *  [Selfless Healer] for Holy no longer causes [Judgment] to grant Holy
         Power. It also is only usable on [Flash of Light], no longer on [Holy
         Light] or [Holy Radiance].
       *  [Tower of Radiance]'s effects have been changed and merged into
         baseline Beacon of Light. 
          * Tower of Radiance now causes Flash of Light and Holy Light on a
            Beacon of Light target to refund 40% of the spell's Mana cost
            instead of generating 1 Holy Power.
         
         
      
      PROTECTION CHANGES
      
      For Protection, we tweaked [Eternal Flame] in order to reduce its massive
      self-healing amount, and provide better balance between talents on that
      row. We also added a new passive, [Shining Protector], in order to give
      defensive value to the new Multistrike stat. Holy Wrath's damage and
      cooldown were also increased, and Sanctified Wrath changed to buff it
      further, in order to give Protection Paladins more burst threat and
      damage, while retaining its core damage-splitting identity.
      
      
       *  [Mastery: Divine Bulwark] now increases damage reduction from Shield
         of the Righteous by 6% (scaling with Mastery, down from starting at
         8%), and causes Bastion of Glory to increase healing received from Word
         of Glory by 6% (scaling with Mastery, down from starting at 8%).
       * Bastion of Glory no longer affects the periodic healing of [Eternal
         Flame]. It still affects the direct healing portion of the ability.
       *  [Sanctuary] now reduces damage taken by 10% (down from 15), and no
         longer increases Armor.
       *  [Guarded by the Light] now increases Stamina by 15% (down from 25%),
         and increases block chance by 5% (down from 10%).
       *  [Shield of the Righteous] now reduces physical damage taken by 20%
         (down from 25%).
       * Bastion of Glory now increases Word of Glory's healing by 6% per stack
         (down from 10% per stack).
       *  [Shining Protector] is a new passive ability for Protection Paladins. 
          * Shining Protector: All heals you receive have a chance equal to your
            Multistrike chance to trigger Shining Protector, healing you for an
            additional 30% of the triggering heal.
         
         
       *  [Holy Wrath]'s damage has been increased by 100%, and its cooldown
         increased to 15 seconds (up from 9 seconds).
       *  [Sanctified Wrath] for Protection Paladins has been redesigned. 
          * Sanctified Wrath (Protection) now increases the damage of Holy Wrath
            by 100% and causes it to generate 1 Holy Power.
         
         
      
      MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES
      
      We made a few additional changes to paladins. We revised the functionality
      of [Hammer of the Righteous] a bit, such that its performance is about the
      same, but its tooltip is much clearer. We also made [Execution Sentence] 
      much more attractive to use as an emergency button. We also revised how 
      [Eternal Flame] interacts with Holy Power, and allowed it to once again
      trigger Illuminated Healing. One big change for Retribution that isn't
      mentioned here is the removal of [Inquisition] (see ability pruning),
      which will have a notable effect on their rotation.
      
      
       *  [Eternal Flame]'s periodic healing effect has been changed. Its
         duration now scales with Holy Power, instead of its healing. Its effect
         at 3 Holy Power remains unchanged.
       *  [Hammer of the Righteous] now deals 50% Physical weapon damage (up
         from 15%) to the primary target, but the primary target is no longer
         hit with the Holy damage.
       * Illuminated Healing can once again be triggered by Eternal Flame.
       * Seals no longer cost any mana.
       * Stay of Execution (the Holy version of [Execution Sentence]) now deals
         its healing in a large burst at first, and then decreasing over time
         (reversed from before).
      
      PRIEST
      
      Priests received several significant changes, mainly focused on reining in
      Discipline's damage absorption shields, improving quality of life for
      Discipline and Holy specializations, and solving single-target damage
      issues for Shadow.
      
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning
      class abilities. For priests, pruning focused on removing redundant
      off-role abilities, trimming cooldowns, and removing niche abilities.
      
      
       *  [Binding Heal] is now only available to Holy priests.
       *  [Evangelism] is now available only to Discipline priests.
       *  [Hymn of Hope] has been removed.
       *  [Heal] has been removed.
       *  [Inner Fire] has been removed.
       *  [Inner Focus] has been removed.
       *  [Inner Will] has been removed.
       *  [Rapture] has been removed.
       *  [Renew] is now available only to Holy priests.
       *  [Shadow Word: Death] is now available only to Shadow priests. 
          * Discipline and Holy priests can add a self-damaging utility to [Holy
            Fire] through a new Major Glyph.
         
         
       *  [Spirit Shell] is now a level-75 talent, replacing [Divine Insight] 
         for Discipline priests.
       *  [Strength of Soul] has been removed.
       *  [Train of Thought] has been removed.
       *  [Void Shift] has been removed.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Priests had quite a few bits of complication strewn throughout their
      spells which we polished out.
      
      
       *  [Greater Heal] has been renamed to Heal.
       *  [Borrowed Time]'s effects have been merged into baseline Power Word:
         Shield for Discipline priests. 
          * Borrowed Time has been redesigned. It now increases the priest's
            stat gains to Haste from all sources by 40% for 6 seconds.
         
         
       *  [Devouring Plague] now always costs 3 Shadow Orbs, and now heals the
         priest for 100% of all damage it deals, instead of healing per tick.
       *  [Holy Fire] now lasts 9 seconds (up from 7 seconds).
       *  [Shadowform] no longer allows any healing spells to be cast but also
         no longer has a restriction on casting other Holy spells.
       *  [Vampiric Embrace] now heals all party and raid members for 10% of
         damage done, and this healing is no longer split between targets (up
         from 75% of damage done, split between targets).
       *  [Lightwell]'s healing effect is no longer canceled if the target takes
         enough damage.
       *  [Pain Suppression] no longer reduces the target's threat by 5%.
       *  [Power Word: Solace] now restores 2% mana (up from 1%).
       *  [Dispersion] and [Vampiric Touch] no longer restore mana. 
          * Base mana regeneration rate for Shadow priests has been increased by
            200%, Shadow Word: Pain and Vampiric Touch mana costs have been
            reduced by 50% to compensate.
         
         
       *  [Evangelism] no longer affects the damage or mana cost of spells.
         Damage of affected spells have been adjusted to compensate.
       *  [Shadow Word: Pain]'s initial damage is now considered direct damage,
         not periodic damage. 
          * Shadowy Apparitions and Shadowy Insight are no longer able to
            trigger from this initial direct damage.
         
         
       *  [Divine Hymn] now heals all party or raid members instead of a
         variable number depending on raid size. Its healing has been adjusted
         to compensate.
       *  [Focused Will] now triggers from any damage taken instead of being
         limited to being the victim of any damage above 5% of total health or
         being critically hit by non-periodic attacks.
      
      LEVEL-90 TALENTS AND ATONEMENT
      
       [Atonement] was the original damage-to-healing conversion ability, but
      grew out of control during Mists of Pandaria. We decided to reduce its
      effectiveness, to bring it more in line with our goal of it being an
      option to trade significant healing for significant damage (ending up
      somewhere between a full healer and a full damage dealer). Another place
      where Discipline's absorbs were too strong was in their interaction with
      the level-90 talents, especially in large raids. Near the end of Mists of
      Pandaria, we uncapped the AoE healing of that talent row; that has proven
      to be a mistake in Discipline's case, not just because it caused the
      level-90 talents themselves to heal for too much, but rather because the
      gigantic overhealing that that produced translated into gigantic [Divine
      Aegis] absorbs.
      
      
       *  [Atonement] now heals for 25% less than before.
       *  [Cascade]'s Mana cost has been reduced by 67%. 
          * Discipline and Holy: Cascade now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from
            instant cast, see also: instant cast heals), heals for 50% less, and
            no longer damages enemies.
          * Shadow: Cascade no longer heals allies.
         
         
       *  [Divine Star]'s Mana cost has been reduced by 67%, and now follows
         standard AoE capping rules. 
          * Discipline and Holy: Divine Star now heals for 50% less, and no
            longer damages enemies.
          * Shadow: Divine Star no longer heals allies.
         
         
       *  [Halo]'s Mana cost has been reduced by 67%, and now follows standard
         AoE capping rules. 
          * Discipline and Holy: Halo now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from
            instant cast, see also: instant cast heals), heals for 50% less, and
            no longer damages enemies.
          * Shadow: Halo no longer heals allies.
         
         
      
      HOLY CHANGES
      
      For Holy priests, our biggest concern is with the Chakras. We think that
      Chakras are the defining abilities of Holy priests, but that they haven't
      lived up to their potential. We decided to move more of their
      effectiveness from their raw throughput buff (which felt like a penalty
      for being in the wrong chakra, rather than a bonus for being in the right
      Chakra) into their bonus effects, and the Holy Word spells that they
      grant. Please note that all Priest healing spells have been retuned to
      account for the loss of throughput increases from Chakras. We also
      returned [Renew] to a normal 1.5-second global cooldown (GCD), so that
      Renew blanketing is still possible, but less ideal without Haste. Finally,
      the ability for Power Word: Shield to critically strike or Multistrike is
      now baseline for all Priest specializations instead of just Discipline so
      that it continues to be a viable choice for Holy at higher gear levels.
      
      
       *  [Divine Providence] is a new passive ability for Holy priests. 
          * Divine Providence increases the amount of the Multistrike stat gains
            from all sources by 5%, and increases the damage and healing of
            Multistrikes by 20%.
         
         
       *  [Cascade] no longer refreshes the duration of Renew for Chakra:
         Serenity.
       *  [Circle of Healing]'s cooldown is now 12 seconds (up from 10 seconds).
       *  [Chakra: Chastise] no longer grants a chance for Smite to reset [Holy
         Word: Chastise]'s cooldown.
       *  [Chakra: Sanctuary] no longer increases healing of area-of-effect
         spells. It now causes healing spell casts to reduce the remaining
         cooldown on Circle of Healing by 1 second instead of always reducing
         the cooldown by 2 seconds.
       *  [Chakra: Serenity] no longer increases healing of single-target
         spells.
       *  [Power Word: Shield] may now critically strike or Multistrike. 
          *  [Divine Aegis] no longer grants [Power Word: Shield] a chance to
            critically strike.
         
         
       *  [Divine Fury] has been removed. (See also: hit and expertise removal.)
       *  [Holy Word: Sanctuary] now heals for 60% more than before.
       *  [Holy Word: Serenity] now heals for 40% more than before.
       *  [Power Word: Shield] now has a chance for a critical effect based on
         critical strike chance and can Multistrike based on Multistrike chance
         for all specializations.
       *  [Purify], [Halo], [Cascade], and [Divine Star] can now be cast while
         in [Spirit of Redemption] form.
       *  [Rapid Renewal] no longer reduces the global cooldown of [Renew].
      
      SHADOW CHANGES
      
      Shadow priests had one large problem toward the end of Mists of Pandaria:
      single-target damage. Their AoE and multi-DoT damage was some of the best
      around, so they still ended up competitive on most fights. But, in any
      fight that was mostly single-target, they felt lacking. Additionally, one
      of the new stats we're adding in Warlords of Draenor, Multistrike, is
      almost exactly what their current Mastery, [Shadowy Recall], does for
      DoTs. So, we took these two problems and came up with a change that we
      think will solve both of them. The result is a new Mastery, which
      primarily increases single-target damage. Shadow priests who want to focus
      on single-target damage can aim for Mastery in their gearing; or, when
      multi-dotting is more valuable, prefer other secondary stats over Mastery.
      
      
       * Shadow priest's Mastery ( [Shadowy Recall]) has been replaced with a
         new Mastery: Mental Anguish. 
          *  [Mastery: Mental Anguish]: Increases the damage of [Mind Blast], 
            [Mind Spike], [Mind Flay], and [Mind Sear] by 20%.
         
         
       *  [Devouring Plague] now always costs 3 Shadow Orbs.
       *  [Spiritual Precision] has been removed. (See also: hit and expertise
         removal.)
      
      
      The cooldown of [Mind Blast] has also been adjusted to make Haste more
      valuable for Shadow, and removes Haste breakpoints.
      
      
       *  [Mind Blast]'s cooldown is now reduced by haste, but its base cooldown
         is now 9 seconds (up from 8 seconds).
      
      TALENT REVISIONS
      
      Several talents were split into different versions by specialization. We
      revised the effectiveness of some of these talents to better balance
      talent choices on their row. We also swapped the Level-15 and Level-60
      talent rows so players are presented with core Priest themed abilities
      earlier in the leveling process.
      
      
      To get back to a balanced place, we've reapplied the AoE caps to the
      level-90 Talents, making them consistent with all other AoE heals, and
      reduced their effectiveness across the board. We've compensated for this
      in the tuning of Priest baseline heals.
      
      
       * Level-15 and Level-60 talent rows have swapped places.
       *  [Divine Insight]'s effects have been split based on specialization. 
          * Discipline: The effect is now based on Spirit Shell.
          * Shadow: This effect is now named Shadowy Insight.
         
         
       *  [From Darkness, Comes Light] has been split into two abilities
         depending on the Priest's Specialization. 
          *  [Surge of Darkness] (Shadow) now has a maximum of 3 charges (up
            from 2) and can now also trigger its effect from Devouring Plague,
            but its chance to trigger has been reduced to 10% (down from 20%) to
            compensate.
          *  [Surge of Light] (Discipline, Holy) activation chance has been
            reduced to 8% (down from 15%).
         
         
       *  [Power Infusion] now grants 25% Haste (up from 20%), but no longer
         increases damage (down from 5%).
       * Solace and Insanity has been split into [Power Word: Solace] for
         Discipline and Holy, and [Insanity] for Shadow. 
          * Insanity has been changed to cause consuming Shadow Orbs to
            transform Mind Flay into Insanity for 2 seconds per Shadow Orb
            consumed.
         
         
       *  [Twist of Fate] now only triggers from healing for Discipline and Holy
         Priests, and only triggers from damage for Shadow Priests.
      
      MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES
      
      First, there are a couple of quality-of-life changes for [Prayer of
      Mending] and [Angelic Feather]. Next is a fix for a problem with [Void
      Tendrils], where it lasts its full duration against creatures that had no
      way to attack it, such as in certain raid encounters (note that the health
      reduction is to keep it where it was in health, compared to player health
      doubling). We also removed the Mana generation from [Shadowfiend], in
      order to simplify it to being a burst-damage-cooldown. And last but
      certainly not least, we're making Holy Nova an efficient AoE healing spell
      for Discipline priests.
      
      
       *  [Angelic Feather] now increases movement speed by 60% (down from 80%).
         If cast on players, will always prefer the casting priest over others,
         then pick the player closest to the targeted location. If there are no
         players where it is targeted, it will still create a feather that can
         be picked up, as before. Additionally, when collecting multiple
         feathers, the duration will be extended instead of replaced; up to a
         maximum of 130% of base duration.
       *  [Enlightenment] is a new passive ability for Discipline priests. 
          * Enlightenment increases the critical healing chance of Prayer of
            Mending by 10%, and increases stat gains to Critical Strike from all
            sources by 5%.
         
         
       *  [Holy Nova] is no longer available through a Major Glyph, and is
         instead a Discipline specialization spell. Its mana cost has been
         lowered and its healing increased. It is intended as the efficient
         area-of-effect (AoE) healing spell for Discipline priests.
       *  [Prayer of Mending] from multiple priests can now be on the same
         target, and can be on multiple targets from the same priest, but the
         ability has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast). (See also: 
         instant cast heals)
       *  [Shadowfiend] no longer restores mana. 
          *  [Mindbender] now restores 0.75% mana per hit (down from 1.75%
            mana).
         
         
       *  [Void Tendrils] now have 10% of the priest's health (down from 20%),
         and damage dealt to the rooted target is now also dealt to the Void
         Tendril itself.
      
      ROGUE
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning
      class abilities. For rogues, a couple of abilities were changed to be
      specialization specific where they were redundant, did some thinning on
      cooldowns.
      
      
       *  [Disarm Trap] has been removed.
       *  [Fan of Knives] is no longer available to Combat Rogues.
       *  [Rupture] is no longer available to Combat Rogues.
       *  [Shadow Blades] has been removed.
       *  [Shadow Walk] has been removed.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Rogues received several mergers of passive abilities. There's also
      additional cooldown thinning with the change to Tricks of the Trade.
      
      
       *  [Assassin's Resolve] now increases damage by 10% (down from 20%).
       *  [Blindside]'s effects have been merged into baseline Mutilate.
       *  [Burst of Speed] now costs 30 Energy (up from 15 Energy).
       *  [Crimson Tempest]'s periodic damage now has rolling periodic behavior,
         meaning that remaining damage from the previous application is added
         into the newly-applied periodic-damage effect.
       *  [Cut to the Chase]'s effects have been merged into baseline Envenom.
       *  [Deadly Throw] no longer has a minimum range.
       *  [Energetic Recovery]'s effects have been merged into baseline [Slice
         and Dice] for Subtlety rogues.
       *  [Envenom] now increases poison chance by 30% (up from 15%).
       *  [Find Weakness]' effects have been merged into baseline [Ambush],
         Garrote, and [Cheap Shot] for Subtlety rogues.
       *  [Garrote] now ticks every 2 seconds (up from every 3 seconds). Damage
         has been adjusted to compensate.
       *  [Killing Spree] no longer increases all damage done for the duration.
         Its damage has been increased to compensate.
       *  [Master of Subtlety]'s effects have been merged into baseline Stealth
         for Subtlety rogues.
       *  [Relentless Strikes]' effects have been merged into [Ruthlessness] for
         Combat Rogues. It remains a separate passive for Assassination and
         Subtlety rogues.
       *  [Restless Blades]' effects have been merged into Ruthlessness.
       *  [Safe Fall]'s effects have been merged into baseline [Fleet Footed].
       *  [Tricks of the Trade] now has no energy cost and no longer increases
         damage caused by the target by 15%.
       *  [Venomous Wounds]'s effects have been merged into baseline Rupture for
         Assassination Rogues. It no longer triggers from Garrote and now always
         triggers when Rupture deals damage (up from a 75% chance).
      
      COMBO POINTS
      
      The biggest change for rogues is a fundamental change to how Combo Points 
      work. They're now shared across all enemies; you can swap targets and you
      won't lose your Combo Points.
      
      
       * Combo Points for rogues are now shared across all targets and they are
         no longer lost when switching targets.
       *  [Redirect] has been removed.
      
      COMBAT CHANGES
      
       [Bandit's Guile] is an interesting mechanic that is important to Combat
      gameplay, but wasn't working out quite as well as we think that it could.
      In particular, there's basically no way to adjust when you're going to be
      in Deep Insight, other than stopping your rotation (and thus wasting
      energy, combo points, temporary effects, cooldown time, etc.). So, we're
      making an adjustment to [Revealing Strike] and Bandit's Guile. The
      intention here is that you can use Revealing Strike in place of [Sinister
      Strike] when you want to delay Deep Insight (such as to line it up with a
      specific upcoming fight mechanic), and have little lost damage besides the
      overall Deep Insight uptime. We don't expect this nuanced rotation
      adjustment to be used by all Combat rogues, but having a little more
      control over the pace of your rotation will be useful to some.
      
      
      Also worth noting here is the removal of [Ambidexterity]. This was done to
      reduce the amount of damage coming from auto attacks for Combat Rogues.
      We've increased the damage of their active abilities to compensate and
      make them more rewarding.
      
      
      Finally, we changed Main Gauche to accentuate the importance of the
      off-hand weapon for Combat.
      
      
       *  [Revealing Strike] now grants Sinister Strike a 25% chance to generate
         an extra Combo Point (up from 20%), but no longer advances Bandit's
         Guile.
       *  [Ambidexterity] has been removed.
       * Main Gauche now deals off-hand weapon damage. Its damage has been
         increased to compensate.
      
      AREA-OF-EFFECT ATTACKS (ASSASSINATION, COMBAT)
      
      Among some other changes to improve rogue AoE damage, we made a couple of
      baseline changes, and added a few Draenor Perks that impacts their AoE.
      
      
       *  [Blade Flurry] can now trigger poisons, and now deals 30% damage (down
         from 40%).
       *  [Seal Fate] now also grants a combo point for area attacks that
         critically strike the rogue's primary target.
      
      SUBTLETY CHANGES
      
       [Honor Among Thieves] is an extremely powerful ability, but has the
      downside that it adds significant disparity between character power while
      soloing and while in a group. We made this change to bring up the soloing
      Subtlety rogue, without having a significant impact on their performance
      while in a group. The passive ability Sinister Calling also received
      significant change to better balance scaling rates, the value of secondary
      stats, improve Multistrike for them, and add rotational depth.
      
      
       *  [Backstab] can now be used on either side of the target, in addition
         to behind the target. (See also: facing requirements)
       *  [Hemorrhage]'s periodic damage is now based on attack power (instead
         of the initial strike's damage), and ticks every 2 seconds. Damage has
         been adjusted to compensate.
       *  [Honor Among Thieves] can now also be triggered by critical hits from
         the rogue's melee Auto Attacks.
       *  [Sinister Calling] now increases Agility by 15% (down from 30%), and
         the amount of Multistrike bonus received from all sources by 5% (in
         order to act as Subtlety's Secondary Stat Attunement). And finally,
         when the rogue Multistrikes with Backstab or Ambush, they also twist
         the blade, causing all Bleed effects to advance by 2 seconds,
         triggering an instant tick.
      
      SUBTERFUGE
      
       [Subterfuge] has proved too powerful, and frustrating to play against in
      PvP, so we decided to reduce its defensive capabilities, while preserving
      its offensive power. We changed the Subterfuge period to allow the use of 
      [Stealth] abilities without actually stealthing you, similar to [Shadow
      Dance].
      
      
       *  [Subterfuge] now allows you to use abilities that require [Stealth] 
         for 3 seconds after leaving Stealth, instead of actually staying
         stealthed for 3 seconds.
      
      SHAMAN
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning
      class abilities. For shaman, we removed some niche abilities, and also
      split out a few abilities by specialization.
      
      
       *  [Ancestral Awakening] has been removed.
       *  [Ancestral Vigor] has been removed.
       *  [Burning Wrath] has been removed.
       *  [Chain Heal] is now available only to Restoration shaman.
       *  [Earth Shock] is now available only to Elemental shaman. Enhancement
         and Restoration shaman should use Frost Shock in its place.
       *  [Earthliving Weapon] has been removed.
       *  [Elemental Focus] has been removed.
       *  [Feral Spirit]'s Spirit Wolves no longer have the Spirit Bite ability.
       *  [Healing Wave] has been removed.
       *  [Lava Burst] now replaces Primal Strike for Elemental and Restoration
         shaman.
       *  [Magma Totem] is now available only to Enhancement shaman.
       *  [Mana Tide Totem] has been removed. Restoration shaman Mana costs have
         been adjusted to compensate.
       *  [Primal Wisdom] has been removed. Enhancement shaman mana regeneration
         has been increased by 100% to compensate. [It is believed this note is 
         in error, and should refer to [Mental Quickness]. Primal Wisdom was
         already removed in Patch 5.0.4.]
       *  [Rockbiter Weapon] has been removed.
       *  [Spiritwalker's Grace] is no longer available to Enhancement shaman.
       *  [Static Shock] has been removed.
       *  [Searing Flames] has been removed. 
          *  [Flametongue Weapon] damage has been increased by 40%, and Lava
            Lash damage has been increased to 280% weapon damage (up from 140%)
            to compensate.
         
         
       *  [Water Shield] is now available only to Restoration shaman, and
         replaces Lightning Shield.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Shaman had a number of extra abilities that were consolidated to provide a
      smoother rotation flow. Mana regeneration and mana costs for Elemental and
      Enhancement were made compensate for abilities removed via Ability
      Pruning. The removal of Weapon Imbues was significant. There was always
      one right answer for each specialization, and so we made the appropriate
      Weapon Imbue passive to each spec, or tuned abilities around its removal.
      
      
      Finally, there's the removal of Rolling Thunder. In concept, this is a
      simple merger of Rolling Thunder into Fulmination, but also with some
      consolidation of its effects; the mana recovery component was removed
      along with other mana changes, and the random chance was removed while
      maximum stack size was increased to compensate. The randomness in Rolling
      Thunder became redundant, because there already was a source of randomness
      in Elemental Overload now that Multistrikes trigger it.
      
      
       *  [Ancestral Spirit]'s mana cost has been reduced by 95%.
       *  [Elemental Fury] has been removed. Elemental shaman now naturally have
         critical strike damage increased to 250% of normal damage.
       *  [Echo of the Elements] has been redesigned. The shaman's spells and
         abilities have a chance to trigger Echo of the Elements, causing their
         next short-cooldown spell or ability to not trigger a cooldown. 
          * Elemental: It may be used on Frost Shock, Earthquake, or Lava Burst. 
            [It is believed the note is in error, as Frost Shock has been
            mentioned on this same page as no longer being available to
            Elemental. The author most likely meant Earth Shock.]
          * Enhancement: It may be used on Fire Nova, Lava Lash, or Stormstrike.
          * Restoration: It may be used on Unleash Life, Purify Spirit, or
            Riptide.
         
         
       *  [Elemental Mastery] now has a 2-minute cooldown (up from 1.5 minute).
       *  [Elemental Oath] and Unleashed Rage have been removed. 
          *  [Grace of Air] now also provides 5% Haste to all party and raid
            members.
         
         
       *  [Flametongue Weapon] and Windfury Weapon have been removed. 
          *  [Enhanced Weapons] is a new passive ability available to
            Enhancement shaman, causing main-hand weapon attacks to have a
            chance to trigger 3 extra attacks, and off-hand weapon attacks to
            deal additional fire damage.
          *  [Lava Lash]'s damage done is no longer increased by Flametongue
            Weapon, and its damage has been increased to compensate.
         
         
       *  [Flurry]'s duration has been increased to 30 seconds.
       *  [Frost Shock] no longer generates additional threat.
       *  [Greater Healing Wave] has been renamed to Healing Wave.
       *  [Healing Tide Totem] now heals all party or raid members, but amount
         healed per target has been reduced to compensate.
       *  [Lava Lash] now spreads Flame Shock to up to 6 nearby enemies (up from
         4 enemies).
       *  [Rolling Thunder] has been removed. 
          * Elemental shaman Mana regeneration has been increased by 50% to
            compensate.
          *  [Fulmination] now causes Elemental Blast, Lightning Bolt, and Chain
            Lightning damage and multistrike damage to always generate an
            additional Lightning Shield charge, up to a maximum of 15. Earth
            Shock will consume any charges beyond 1, dealing their total damage
            to the enemy target.
         
         
       *  [Shamanistic Rage] no longer reduces Mana costs while active.
       *  [Thunderstorm] no longer regenerates Mana.
       * Totems will no longer cause hostile creatures to enter combat with the
         shaman based on proximity.
       *  [Unleash Elements] has been split into different versions based on
         specialization. 
          * Unleash Elements is now available only to Enhancement shaman, and
            now increases attack speed by 60% (up from 50%), and increases the
            damage of the shaman's next Fire spell by 40% (up from 30%), but no
            longer deals direct damage or requires an enemy target.
          *  [Unleash Flame] has been made into a separate ability available
            only to Elemental shaman, and now increases the damage of the
            shaman's next Fire spell by 40% (up from 30%), but no longer deals
            direct damage or requires an enemy target.
          *  [Unleash Life] has been made into a separate ability available only
            to Restoration shaman, and now heals an ally and increases the
            effect of the shaman's next direct heal by 30%.
          *  [Unleashed Fury] now provides similar benefits, but applied as
            buffs to the shaman instead of debuffing an enemy. For Enhancement
            shaman, it now grants 5% increase Multistrike chance instead of
            causing auto-attacks to trigger Static Shock.
         
         
       *  [Water Shield] now only triggers from melee attacks. 
          * Mana costs for Restoration shaman have been adjusted to compensate.
         
         
       *  [Resurgence] no longer requires Water Shield to be active.
      
      ELEMENTAL AND ENHANCEMENT CHANGES
      
      For Elemental and Enhancement, we had a few problems to solve. Enhancement
      suffers from having their damage split among so many damage sources that
      none of it feels impressive. We changed the damage of several abilities to
      try to reorganize their damage into fewer, more impactful abilities, while
      keeping the net total the same. For a long time Elemental shaman was one
      of the specializations most impacted by movement, at a time where other
      casters were increasingly able to cast while moving.
      
      
      In Warlords of Draenor, we're pulling back on the ability for many casters
      to deal damage while moving, and that includes Elemental. They will still
      have some ability to deal damage while moving, through Shocks, [Unleash
      Elements], and instant Lava Bursts. For [Chain Lightning], we wanted to
      reduce the impact of Haste soft capping, and so changed [Shamanism] to
      increase damage instead of reduce cast time. Additionally, we simplified 
      [Wind Shear] by removing its impact on threat, which no longer matters.
      
      
       *  [Ascendance] for the Enhancement specialization now changes the
         shaman's auto attacks and [Stormstrike] to deal Wind-based physical
         damage that bypasses armor.
       *  [Earth Elemental Totem] deals 90% less Auto Attack damage but
         generates 1000% more threat.
       *  [Elemental Precision] has been removed. (See also: hit and expertise
         removal.)
       *  [Feral Spirit]'s damage has been increased by 300%.
       *  [Fire Nova] now has a cooldown of 4.5 second (up from 4.0 seconds).
       *  [Flurry] has been redesigned. Melee haste effects now reduce the
         global cooldown and cooldowns of Earth Shock, Fire Nova, Flame Shock,
         Frost Shock, Lava Lash, Static Shock, Stormstrike, and Unleash
         Elements.
       *  [Lava Lash] now has a cooldown of 10.5 seconds (up from 10 seconds).
       *  [Lightning Bolt] can no longer be cast while moving by default.
         Effects like [Spiritwalker's Grace] can still make the spell able to be
         cast while moving.
       *  [Magma Totem]'s damage has been increased by 100%, and now ticks
         faster with Haste.
       *  [Maelstrom Weapon]'s chance to trigger has been reduced by 20%.
       * Primal Earth Elemental's Pulverize ability no longer deals damage.
       *  [Searing Totem]'s Searing Bolt now has a 2-second cast time (up from
         1.5 seconds), but casts faster with Haste, and its damage has been
         increased by 120%.
       *  [Shamanism] no longer reduces the cast time of [Chain Lightning], but
         instead now increases the damage of Chain Lightning by 100% (up from
         70%).
       *  [Spiritual Insight] no longer increases the chance to hit with
         Lightning Bolt, Lava Burst, Hex, or Flame Shock. (See also: hit and
         expertise removal.)
       *  [Stormstrike] now has a cooldown of 7.5 seconds (down from 8 seconds).
       *  [Wind Shear] no longer affects threat.
       *  [Windfury Weapon] no longer has a 3-second internal cooldown.
      
      ELEMENTAL OVERLOAD AND MOLTEN EARTH
      
      One of the new secondary stats, Multistrike, functions very similarly to
      Elemental Overload. We wanted to keep Mastery and Multistrike feeling
      distinct, but also know how iconic and important Elemental Overload is for
      Elemental Shaman. So, we decided to merge the two together with
      Multistrike driving Elemental Overload, and give the Elemental
      specialization a new Mastery. For the new Mastery, we wanted to strengthen
      the Elemental Shaman's connection to earth energies, and added damage that
      continues while the Shaman is moving. The summary of all this is that if
      you liked Mastery before, favor Multistrike instead for the same effect.
      Or try out the new Mastery: Molten Earth. Chain Lightning and Earthquake
      were also improved significantly to offset the fact that Elemental
      Overload was a massive buff to it, but Molten Earth is not.
      
      
       *  [Elemental Overload] is now a regular passive ability and is no longer
         increased by Mastery. It grants 35% increased Multistrike damage and
         healing, and an additional 20% to Multistrike chance. It also increases
         the amount of the Multistrike stat gains from all sources by 5%,
         serving as Elemental's Secondary Stat attunement.
       *  [Mastery: Molten Earth] is a new Mastery for Elemental Shaman. 
          * Molten Earth causes the Shaman's damaging spells to incite the earth
            around to come to their aid for 6 seconds, repeatedly dealing Fire
            damage to their most recently attacked target.
         
         
       *  [Chain Lightning]'s damage has been increased by 50%.
       *  [Earthquake]'s damage has been increased by 33%.
      
      RESTORATION CHANGES
      
      Restoration shaman had the most passive and smart healing of any healer,
      and so received some reductions in that area, along with buffs elsewhere
      to keep them competitive.
      
      
       *  [Chain Heal] now heals each chain target for 10% less than the
         previous target.
       *  [Conductivity] is no longer triggered by damaging spells for
         Restoration shaman, or by healing spells for non-Restoration shaman.
       *  [Elemental Blast] now also grants increased Spirit for Restoration
         Shaman, in addition to the random secondary stat. Spirit amount granted
         is equal to double the random secondary stat amount.
       * Multiple Earth Shields can now be applied to the same target.
       *  [Earthliving Weapon] now increases healing done by 5% (instead of
         increasing healing Spell Power by a flat amount).
       *  [Healing Stream Totem]'s mana cost has been reduced to 10% of base
         mana (down from 23.5%), and its healing has been reduced by 50%.
       *  [Riptide]'s healing has been adjusted to put significantly more of it
         into the initial heal. The initial heal amount has been increased by
         70%, while the periodic healing amount has been reduced by 20%.
       *  [Tidal Waves] now reduces the cast time of [Healing Wave] by 20% (down
         from 30%).
       *  [Unleash Life] no longer increases the healing from [Healing Rain] but
         its direct healing has been increased by 100%.
       *  [Glyph of Chaining] no longer causes [Chain Heal] to have a 2-second
         cooldown.
       *  [Glyph of Totemic Recall] now only increases the mana returned from
         recalling your totems by 25% (down from 75%).
      
      MISCELLANEOUS
      
      We also made a couple quality of life improvements to shaman Shield
      spells.
      
      
       *  [Lightning Shield] now persists through death.
       *  [Water Shield] now persists through death.
      
      WARLOCK
      
      Warlocks received some polish but remain relatively unchanged. They saw
      the most change of any class in Mists of Pandaria, and so were in need of
      less revision this time around.
      
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning
      class abilities. For warlocks, that primarily focused on removing niche
      abilities.
      
      
       *  [Curse of the Elements] has been removed.
       *  [Demonic Rebirth] has been removed.
       *  [Drain Life] is no longer available to Destruction warlocks. 
          *  [Harvest Life] has been replaced with a new talent called Searing
            Flames for Destruction warlocks. 
             *  [Searing Flames] reduces [Ember Tap]'s Burning Ember cost by
               50%, and increases its healing by 50%.
            
            
         
         
       * Metamorphosis: [Void Ray] has been removed.
       *  [Seed of Corruption] now replaces Rain of Fire for Affliction
         warlocks.
       *  [Twilight Ward] has been removed.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Soulburn had several extremely niche spell amplifications which were
      removed. We distinguished Hand of Gul'dan and Chaos Wave further by
      removing the snare from the former and improving the snare of the latter.
      Beyond that, there was a simple consolidation of some abilities.
      
      
       * All of the various [Soulburn] effects are now learned together with
         Soulburn, instead of at different levels. 
          *  [Drain Life] no longer gains a benefit from Soulburn.
          *  [Health Funnel] no longer gains a benefit from Soulburn.
          *  [Unending Breath] no longer gains a benefit from Soulburn.
         
         
       *  [Hand of Gul'dan] no longer snares the enemy. 
          *  [Chaos Wave] now reduces enemy movement speed by 50%.
         
         
       *  [Decimation]'s effects have been merged into baseline [Soul Fire] and 
         [Shadow Bolt].
       *  [Fel Armor]'s effects have been merged into [Blood Pact].
       *  [Grimoire of Supremacy] pets now generates 20% more [Demonic Fury].
       *  [Malefic Grasp] has been removed. Its effects have been merged into 
         [Drain Soul] which Affliction warlocks should use in its place.
       *  [Nightfall]'s effects have been merged into baseline Corruption for
         Affliction warlocks and now has a 6% chance to trigger (down from 10%).
       *  [Pyroclasm]'s effects have been merged into baseline [Backdraft].
       *  [Seed of Corruption] and [Soulburn: Seed of Corruption] can no longer
         both apply to the same target.
      
      RAID UTILITY
      
      We felt that warlocks brought too much unique raid utility, so decided to
      tone down Healthstones and [Demonic Gateway]. We moved healing potions and
      Healthstones into a cooldown of their own, and made them usable once per
      combat.
      
      
       * Demonic Gateways no longer have charges (up from being limited to 5
         charges). Every party or raid member can use them once every 90 seconds
         (up from 45 seconds). The maximum distance apart they can be placed is
         now 40 yards (down from 70 yards).
       *  [Healthstone]'s cooldown will now not reset until the player leaves
         combat. Healing from this ability is now a flat amount (instead of a %
         of maximum health) and can no longer be a Critical Effect.
      
      AFFLICTION CHANGES
      
      For Affliction, we're happy with their rotation. But, [Drain Soul] was
      causing them to be too strong in situations where they had a steady supply
      of small creatures to kill. We reduced the effectiveness of its on-kill
      effect in order to solve this. Additionally, Soul Swap was changed to cost
      1 Soul Shard to push it into its intended role of being a more expensive
      but faster method of applying your periodic damage effects, and better
      balance it against Haunt.
      
      
       *  [Drain Soul] now creates 1 Soul Shard (down from 4 Soul Shards) when
         the target dies.
       *  [Haunt] now increases periodic damage by 30% (down from 35%).
       *  [Soul Swap] now costs 1 Soul Shard (up from none). 
          *  [Soulburn]: Soul Swap costs a total of 2 Soul Shards (up from 1).
         
         
      
      DEMONOLOGY CHANGES
      
      We were unsatisfied with Grimoire of Sacrifice for Demonology.
      Fundamentally, it did not fit Demonology's theme to sacrifice their pet,
      full time. We had toyed with ideas where it acted as a temporary cooldown
      for Demonology, but have decided to replace it with a new talent, which is
      more theme-appropriate, and fits well against the competition in that
      talent row. We also tweaked the design of Master Demonologist, in order to
      solve some edge cases, and simplify and clarify its effects.
      
      
       *  [Mastery: Master Demonologist] has been slightly changed. It now
         passively increases all damage by 6% regardless of form. While in
         Metamorphosis, it further increases the damage of Touch of Chaos, Chaos
         Wave, Doom, Immolation Aura, and Soul Fire while by 12%.
       * Demon pets controlled by Demonology warlocks now deal 20% more damage.
       *  [Grimoire of Sacrifice] is no longer available to Demonology warlocks
         and has a new talent, Grimoire of Synergy in its place. 
          *  [Grimoire of Synergy]: When the warlock or their demon deals
            damage, there is a chance to trigger Demonic Synergy, granting the
            other one 15% increased damage for 15 seconds.
         
         
      
      MOVEMENT ABILITIES
      
      We've reduced the ability for ranged damage dealers to deal damage while
      moving in Warlords. Kil'jaeden's Cunning became a problematic talent
      because its mobility made warlocks much stronger compared to other
      casters. We redesigned how the ability works to be more powerful in bursts
      instead of always affecting only some spells.
      
      
       *  [Kil'jaeden's Cunning] has been redesigned. Kil'jaeden's Cunning calls
         upon the cunning of Kil'jaeden to permit movement while casting Warlock
         spells. This spell may be cast while casting other spells and lasts 8
         seconds with a 1-minute cooldown.
       *  [Fel Flame] was removed.
      
      MISCELLANEOUS
      
      Finally, there are a couple of miscellaneous changes. For Drain Life, we
      reduced the base healing somewhat, but massively increased the
      effectiveness of the Glyph which increases its healing, so as to help open
      up more potential Drain Life use in ideal situations. And lastly, we
      simplified Shadowburn a bit.
      
      
       *  [Drain Life] now heals for 30% less than before.
       *  [Shadowburn] no longer generates any mana.
       *  [Glyph of Drain Life] now increases the healing of Drain Life by 100%
         (up from 30%).
      
      WARRIOR
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning
      class abilities. For warriors, we focused on removing abilities that were
      redundant, and making some tweaks to their rotations.
      
      
       *  [Berserker Stance] has been removed.
       *  [Cleave] has been removed.
       *  [Colossus Smash] is now available only to Arms warriors.
       *  [Deep Wounds] is now available only to Protection warriors.
       *  [Demoralizing Banner] has been removed.
       *  [Flurry] has been removed.
       *  [Mocking Banner] is now available only to Protection warriors.
       *  [Mortal Strike] now replaces Heroic Strike for Arms warriors.
       *  [Rallying Cry] is no longer available to Protection warriors.
       *  [Recklessness] is now available only to Fury and Arms warriors.
       *  [Shield Wall] is now available only to Protection warriors.
       *  [Throw] has been removed.
       *  [Thunder Clap] is no longer available to Fury warriors.
       *  [Whirlwind] is now available only to Arms and Fury warriors.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
       *  [Battle Shout] now lasts 1 hour and no longer generates Rage.
       *  [Blood and Thunder]'s effects have been merged into baseline Deep
         Wounds for Protection warriors.
       *  [Charge] no longer generates Rage when charging against a non-player
         target multiple times in a row. Charge will still always generate Rage
         when used against other players.
       * Commanding Shout now lasts 1 hour and no longer generates Rage.
       *  [Defensive Stance] now reduces damage taken by 20% (down from 25%).
       *  [Demoralizing Shout] now lasts 8 seconds (down from 10 seconds).
       *  [Last Stand] now lasts 12 seconds (down from 20 seconds). [This is
         believed to be a typo. It had been reduced to 15 seconds, not 12.]
       *  [Shield Wall] now lasts 8 seconds (down from 12 seconds).
       *  [Single-Minded Fury]'s effects have been merged into Crazed Berserker.
       *  [Titan's Grip]'s effects have been merged into Crazed Berserker.
       *  [Crazed Berserker] now increases all damage by 30% (up from 20%) while
         using one-handed weapons.
       *  [Hamstring] now costs 10 Rage and deals 20% weapon damage, in addition
         to the movement speed slow. [This is believed to be a typo. It already
         cost 10 rage and the added weapon damage was only 5%]
       *  [Meat Cleaver]'s effects have been merged into baseline Whirlwind for
         Fury warriors.
       *  [Seasoned Soldier] now increases damage by 10% (down from 15%).
       *  [Sword and Board]'s effects have been merged into baseline Devastate.

         of nearby enemies by 50% for 6 sec.
       *  [Ultimatum]'s effects have been merged into baseline Shield Slam.
      
      STANCE CHANGES
      
      Warriors have always had stances; they're very important to the feeling of
      being a warrior. In order to make stances more meaningful, and ease
      keybinds, we made stances have their own action bars, and re-added stance
      restrictions on abilities. However, we also made it so that you'll
      automatically be shifted into the appropriate stance if you try to use an
      ability that isn't usable in your current stance. One important difference
      between this and previous incarnations of warrior stances is that these
      abilities are rotational, not utility cooldowns. Stances are now more for
      different gameplay modes (dealing damage vs. tanking). There shouldn't be
      cases where you find yourself swapping stances, use an ability, and then
      immediately swapping back.
      
      
       * Warrior Stances now once again have their own action bars. 
          * Attempting to use an ability that requires a different stance will
            now automatically switch to that stance.
         
         
       *  [Colossus Smash] now requires Battle Stance.
       *  [Recklessness] now requires Battle Stance.
       *  [Sweeping Strikes] now requires Battle Stance.
       *  [Shield Barrier] is now available for all Warrior specializations (was
         Protection only) and requires Defensive Stance. 
          * For Arms and Fury warriors, Shield Barrier can be used without a
            shield.
         
         
      
      ARMS CHANGES
      
      We wanted to fix a few problems with Warriors. Prominently, we still
      weren't happy with Arms' rotation (and neither were many players), so
      we've made some more changes. The goal is to remove needless complexity
      while simultaneously adding more depth. As mentioned in the above section
      on Ability Pruning, Overpower and Heroic Strike have been removed for Arms
      warriors.
      
      
      In addition, we weren't satisfied with the Mastery for Arms. The intended
      flavor for Arms is about hitting with few, big, and heavy weapon strikes.
      Strikes of Opportunity actually went opposite of that, adding frequent
      little hits. We've replaced Strikes of Opportunity with a new Mastery
      which accentuates their intended design.
      
      
       *  [Battle Stance] for Arms warriors now generates 115% more Rage from
         auto-attacks and Critical Strikes now generate double Rage.
       *  [Defensive Stance] for Arms warriors now generates 50% as much Rage
         from auto-attacks as in [Battle Stance].
       * Arms warriors now generate Rage from taking auto-attack damage. Each 1%
         of health taken as damage will generate 1 Rage, up to 5 Rage per hit.
       * Mastery: [Strikes of Opportunity] has been removed, and replaced with a
         new ability, Mastery: Weapons Master. 
          *  [Mastery: Weapons Master] increases the damage of [Colossus Smash], 
            [Mortal Strike], and [Execute] abilities by 28% (increasing with
            Mastery).
         
         
       *  [Colossus Smash] now costs 20 Rage, deals 225% increased damage, and
         no longer increases the damage of Slam.
       *  [Enrage] is no longer available to Arms warriors.
       *  [Execute] for Arms warriors now costs 10 Rage, and consumes up to 30
         additional Rage to deal additional damage.
       *  [Mortal Strike] now costs 20 Rage (instead of generating 10 Rage).
       *  [Overpower] has been removed. Arms warriors should now use Rend and
         Whirlwind instead.
       *  [Rend] is a new ability for Arms warriors. 
          * Rend causes bleed damage over 18 seconds, and a final burst of bleed
            damage when the effect expires. Costs 5 Rage.
         
         
       *  [Slam] has been removed. Arms Warriors should now use Rend and
         Whirlwind instead.
       *  [Sweeping Strikes] now costs 10 Rage (down from 30 Rage).
       *  [Sudden Death] has been removed.
       *  [Unbridled Wrath] has been removed.
       *  [Whirlwind] now costs 20 Rage for Arms Warriors.
      
      BURST DAMAGE COOLDOWNS
      
      As with other classes, we wanted to reduce cooldown stacking. Cutting 
      [Skull Banner] did a ton to help that across the whole game. But for
      warriors specifically, we needed to make further changes, including
      merging some of the personal benefit of Skull Banner back into 
      [Recklessness]. Also, to make up for [Throw] being removed, we modified 
      [Heroic Throw] to be more frequently usable.
      
      
       *  [Heroic Throw] is now a high-threat ability, generating 300% extra
         threat, has a 6-second cooldown (down from 30 seconds), but now has a
         15 yard minimum range. [This is believed to be a typo. The minimum
         range was increased to 8 yards, not 15.]
       *  [Recklessness] now increases Critical Strike chance by 15% (down from
         30%) and increases Critical Strike damage by 10% (up from 0%).
       *  [Shattering Throw] no longer reduces the armor of the target; it only
         does damage and breaks immunities. 
          * It also is no longer learned via any specialization, but instead
            through a new Major Glyph, [Glyph of Shattering Throw].
         
         
      
      HASTE FOR WARRIORS
      
      Haste has long been a problematic stat for warriors, usually being of
      little value. As part of our commitment to ensuring all secondary stats
      are valuable (except Bonus Armor for non-tanks and Spirit for non-healers,
      of course), we're making a significant change to warriors, to ensure that
      Haste has strong, competitive value. We're giving all warriors a new
      passive, which lets haste affect their global cooldown, and the cooldowns
      of their very-short-cooldown rotational abilities.
      
      
       *  [Headlong Rush] is a new passive ability for warriors: 
          * Headlong Rush: Haste reduces global cooldown and the cooldowns of 
            [Mortal Strike], [Bloodthirst], [Shield Slam], and [Thunder Clap].
         
         
      
      PROTECTION CHANGES
      
      Protection warriors have received a few notable changes. First, we removed
      Dodge and Parry from gear, and expect Protection warriors to value Haste
      and Critical Strike as important secondary stats. In order to achieve
      that, we made [Riposte] give defensive value to Critical Strike. The
      aforementioned [Headlong Rush] also helps for valuing Haste.
      
      
       *  [Mastery: Critical Block] now increases critical block chance by 12%
         (down from 17.6%).
       *  [Blood Craze] is a new passive ability for Protection warriors. 
          * Blood Craze causes Multistrike auto attacks to trigger a Blood
            Craze, which regenerates 3% of the Warrior's health over 3 seconds.
            When this effect is refreshed, the remaining duration is added to
            the new effect.
         
         
       *  [Riposte] has been redesigned. 
          * Riposte now gives the warrior Parry equal to their Critical Strike
            bonus from gear.
         
         
       *  [Shield Block] now regenerates a new charge every 12 seconds (up from
         every 9 seconds).
       *  [Unwavering Sentinel] no longer increases Armor, but now also reduces
         the chance for attacks to be parried by 3%. (See also: hit and
         expertise removal.)
      
      TALENT CHANGES
      
      A few warrior talents also were in need of revision. First, [Second Wind] 
      was problematic; it was sometimes too weak, and sometimes too strong. We
      chose to change it from a passive health regeneration effect to the new 
      Leech effect, so that low-health warriors have to maintain combat in order
      to benefit, instead of kiting, hiding, or otherwise playing defensively.
      Enraged Regeneration was changed to account for the removal of Enrage from
      Arms.
      
      
      The level-45 talent row was removed for crowd-control disarmament reasons,
      and also wanted to allow you to choose more rotational complexity through
      talents. We replaced the row with new talents, many of which are
      specialization-specific, giving you a variety of playstyle choices for
      your warrior.
      
      
      For the level-60 and level-90 talent rows, certain combinations were
      proving problematic. We decided that [Storm Bolt] would better compete
      with [Shockwave] and [Dragon Roar], and that [Bladestorm] would better
      compete with Avatar and [Bloodbath], so swapped Storm Bolt and
      Bladestorm's positions. We also adjusted the effects of a few talents in
      order to make them more competitive with the talents on their row.
      
      
       *  [Bladestorm] is now a level-90 talent, swapping places with [Storm
         Bolt]. 
          * Bladestorm no longer allows use of Shouts except [Demoralizing
            Shout] while active. It does still allow the use of Taunt, [Enraged
            Regeneration], [Shield Wall], and [Last Stand].
         
         
       *  [Enraged Regeneration] now heals for 100% more but the amount healed
         is no longer increased by being Enraged.
       *  [Dragon Roar]'s damage is no longer reduced when hitting more than 1
         target.
       *  [Mass Spell Reflection]'s cooldown has been reduced to 30 seconds, but
         it now replaces [Spell Reflection].
       *  [Second Wind] no longer directly heals the warrior while active.
         Instead, Second Wind grants the warrior 10% Leech while active, which
         causes the warrior to heal for 10% of all damage and healing done by
         the warrior while active.
       *  [Storm Bolt] is now a level-60 talent, swapping places with
         Bladestorm.
       *  [Staggering Shout] has been removed and replaced with 3 new talents
         that vary by specialization. 
          * Arms: [Taste for Blood]: Each time Rend deals damage, gain 3 Rage.
          * Fury: [Furious Strikes]: Wild Strike costs 25 less Rage.
          * Protection: [Heavy Repercussions]: Shield Slam deals 30% additional
            damage while Shield Block or Shield Charge is active.
         
         
       *  [Piercing Howl] has been removed and replaced with a new talent,
         Sudden Death. 
          *  [Sudden Death] causes auto-attack hits to have a 10% chance to make
            the next Execute free and useable on any target, regardless of
            health level. These Executes do not consume additional Rage to deal
            additional damage.
          *  [Piercing Howl] is now available to all Fury Warriors as a baseline
            ability.
         
         
       *  [Disrupting Shout] has been removed and replaced with 3 new talents
         that vary by specialization. 
          * Arms: [Slam]: Slam an opponent, causing 100% weapon damage. Each
            consecutive use of Slam increases the damage dealt by 50% and Rage
            cost by 100%. Requires Battle Stance. [Note: Does not require Battle
            Stance.]
          * Fury: [Unquenchable Thirst]: Bloodthirst no longer has a cooldown.
          * Protection: [Unyielding Strikes]: Devastate reduces the cost of
            Heroic Strike by 5 Rage for 5 seconds, stacking up to 6 times. Once
            this effect reaches 6 applications, its duration will no longer
            refresh.
         
         
      
      FURY CHANGES
      
      To better separate the playstyles between Fury and Arms warriors, we've
      made several significant changes to Fury warriors and make them a better
      fit for the specialization's theme: a relentless, bloodthirsty berserker.
      In particular, Colossus Smash and Heroic Strike was removed, since those
      abilities resulted in gameplay that was the complete opposite of that
      intended style. Wild Strike was modified to fill the role of a quick
      excess Rage dump. We also felt that auto attack damage had become too high
      and moved some of that damage into Execute. Execute has been changed to
      now deal damage based on Weapon Damage instead of just Attack Power.
      Finally, we've updated some to spell alerts to improve usability.
      
      
       *  [Bloodsurge]'s effects have been merged into baseline Bloodthirst and
         no longer reduce Wild Strike's global cooldown. Its spell alert has
         moved to the top slot instead of the left and right slots, and now has
         2 charges (down from 3 charges).
       *  [Bloodthirst] now replaces Heroic Strike for Fury Warriors. 
          * Wild Strike now has a 0.75 second baseline global cooldown, and
            costs 45 Rage.
         
         
       * Bloodthirst now has 30% additional Critical Strike chance (instead of
         double the normal Critical Strike chance).
       *  [Crazed Berserker] no longer increases auto attack damage. Instead, it
         also causes Execute to hit with the off-hand weapon.
       *  [Raging Blow] now extends the duration of Colossus Smash by 2 seconds,
         and has a spell alert on the left and right slots. [This is believed to
         be in error, as Colossus Smash was made exclusive to the Arms
         specialization in this same patch]
       *  [Glyph of Colossus Smash] is a new glyph available to Fury warriors.
         The glyph increases the duration of Colossus Smash's effect to 20
         seconds, but reduces its effectiveness. [This is believed to be in
         error, as Glyph of Colossus Smash was removed in this same patch
         without anything replacing it.]
      
      ENRAGE AND DEEP WOUNDS
      
      We also expanded [Enrage] to affect all damage, not just Physical damage,
      and increased its duration slightly so that it can cover burst windows
      like Colossus Smash adequately. We're also making a change to the design
      of [Deep Wounds], to try to limit is effectiveness in PvP, without hurting
      its effectiveness in PvE.
      
      
       *  [Mastery: Unshackled Fury] (Fury) now increases all damage (up from
         only Physical damage).
       *  [Deep Wounds] now lasts 15 seconds, or until the target is healed to
         full health.
       *  [Enrage] now increases all damage (up from only Physical damage).
      
      ADDITIONAL CHANGES
      WORLD ENVIRONMENT
      
       * Nighttime environments for some areas received lighting adjustments to
         make them more night like.
       * Cross-realm zones have been enabled for the continent of Pandaria.
       * Classic starting areas (Levels 1-10) received a number of improvements
         to the tutorial, quests, and creature/NPC tuning to provide a smoother
         starting experience.
      
      
      Creatures
      
      
       * Kor'kron guards and forces loyal to Garrosh have been ousted from Horde
         cities and settlements.
       * Access to Ordon Sanctuary or eligibility for loot from Ordos no longer
         requires players to have completed the Legendary Cloak questline. 
          * Spoke too soon. The change below has been reverted. Eligibility for
            loot from defeating Ordos has not changed. It still requires one of
            the characters on an account license to have obtained the Legendary
            Cloak. -Rygarius
         
         
      
      
      Isle of Thunder
      
      
       * Troves of the Thunder King has been retired and associated achievements
         have been converted into Feats of Strength.
       *  [Key to the Palace of Lei Shen] has been removed. [Elder Charm of Good
         Fortune] will now drop in place of the key.
      
      QUESTS
      
       *  [90] Warforged Seals is no longer a weekly quest. Players can now
         redeem as many Warforged Seals as they have Lesser Charms of Good
         Fortune for!
       * Warlocks that have successfully completed [90] Infiltrating the Black
         Temple by defeating Kanrethad Ebonlocke before patch 6.0.2 will receive
         a special title.
      
      
      Legendary Cloak Quest Line
      
      
       * As part of the transition from Mists of Pandaria to Warlords of Draenor
         , players who are not already on the Legendary Cloak quest line will no
         longer be able to begin it.
       * Players that are already on the Legendary Cloak quest line have until
         November 13 to complete Wrathion's tasks and challenges. Once Warlords
         of Draenor launches, the Legendary Cloak quest line will be gone
         entirely—the quests and the cloak will no longer be obtainable, and any
         related in-progress quests will be cleared from the quest log.
       * Characters will continue to be able to repurchase rewards they've
         already obtained (such as the epic cloak and Legendary metagem) from
         the quest line.
       *  [90] A Test of Valor has been removed. Players on Wrathion's Legendary
         quest line will now skip ahead to the next step.
       * Full details of the changes can be found in the blog titled: Legendary
         Cloak Quest Last Chance – Black Prince Buff Extended.
      
      RAIDS, DUNGEONS, AND SCENARIOS
      
      Valor and Justice Point Removal
      
      
       *  [Valor Points] and [Justice Points] have been removed.
       * Most items that formerly had a Valor and Justice Point cost now cost
         gold instead.
       * Valor and Justice Points remaining on a character will be converted
         into gold at a rate of 47 silver per point.
      
      
      Personal Loot for Raids
      
      
       * Support for personal loot mode has expanded to other Raid difficulties
         (Normal, Heroic, and Mythic) on Siege of Orgrimmar and in future Raids.
       * Loot is no longer automatically deposited to the player's inventory
         after defeating a boss in personal loot mode. Players eligible to
         receive loot should now be able to loot the boss to see what they
         received. 
          * Note: Siege of Origrimmar on Raid Finder difficulty uses the new
            personal loot system. Players should now loot the boss or a chest
            that spawns after defeating them.
         
         
       * Raid Leaders can now elect to use Personal loot mode for their Raid
         under Loot Options.
       * In the event a character that's eligible but was unable to loot the
         boss, contents of what they would have received is automatically mailed
         to the them.
      
      
      Siege of Orgrimmar
      
      
       * Siege of Orgrimmar achievements will be relabeled according to the new
         difficulty structure (e.g. "Heroic: Malkorok" will now be " [Mythic:
         Malkorok]"). Credit for these achievements will be retroactively
         awarded to players who earned them prior to Patch 6.0.2.
       * Garrosh Hellscream 
          * "Ahead of the Curve" and "Cutting Edge" achievements for defeating
            Garrosh Hellscream are no longer obtainable.
         
         
      
      
      Legacy raid changes
      
      
       * Dragon Soul: Characters above level 86 can now solo-queue for Dragon
         Soul on Raid Finder difficulty by speaking with Auridormi outside of
         the entrance to Dragon Soul in Caverns of Time.
       * Icecrown Citadel: Door leading past Valithria is now open by default,
         allowing players to skip the encounter.

               now shift-click to specify the amount of items they want to
               purchase.
             * Trading Post Parts that drop in Ashran now have a chance to drop
               from all creatures and NPCs that drop Artifact Fragments, with an
               increased drop chance based on the quality of the creature or
               NPCs.
             * Trading Post no longer requires Garrison Resources to build or
               upgrade.
             * Some merchants have started accepting Crescent Saberfish Flesh as
               payment.
            
            
         
         
       * Garrison Invasions 
          * Players that have performed above-and-beyond expectations for a Gold
            rating while defending their Garrisons from an invasion can now
            attain a Platinum rating. Platinum rating awards a level 660 item
            and a chance at obtaining an item that can be used to summon a raid
            or world boss.
         
         
      
      COSMETIC TRANSFORMATIONS AND TOY EFFECTS
      
       * Improvements have been made to the way that cosmetic transformations
         are handled. Previously, using another transformation would overwrite
         or cancel an existing effect. Now, characters can retain multiple
         cosmetic transformations and the one with the highest priority will be
         visible. If a higher priority transformation is canceled or expires,
         the next highest priority transformation will then be visible.
       * Cosmetic transformation effects that do not have a mount riding
         animation are now temporarily suppressed when using a mount
         (previously, the effect is either canceled or prevented the use of
         mounts while active). Characters will regain the transformation once
         they dismount.
       * Cosmetic transformations that alter the character's appearance now have
         a higher priority than druid combat forms. This means druids can keep a
         transformation while shapeshifted.
       * Many druid shapeshift forms now have attachment points on the head and
         back for cosmetic toy effects such as [Blazing Wings] or Pepe.
         Additional shapeshift forms may receive attachment points in the
         future.
       * To retain and improve readability in rated PvP environments, cosmetic
         transformations are now suppressed for all classes while inside a rated
         PvP environment (Arenas or Rated Battlegrounds).
      
      GENERAL
      
       * Accounts with an inactive subscription are now able to log in with the
         same restrictions that Starter Edition accounts have with the
         additional perk of being able to join guilds that characters on the
         account already are a member of.
       * Removed the requirement to have a character that's level 55 or higher
         to unlock the death knight as a playable class.
       * New Graphics Options 
          * Particle Density in graphics settings now have 3 detail levels (down
            from 5). This may affect the number of particles generated by some
            particle systems.
          * Ambient Occlusion 
             * Added new ambient occlusion method NVIDIA HBAO+, available on all
               DirectX 11 capable video cards.
            
            
          * Anti-Aliasing 
             * MSAA is once again supported, with additional controls for
               fine-tuning under Advanced graphics options.
             * A new SSAA anti-aliasing option is now available for high-end
               video cards.
            
            
          * New Lighting 
             * Per-pixel deferred point lights have been added to create more
               realistic lighting throughout Draenor.
            
            
         
         
      
      ITEMIZATION
      
       * Tertiary Stats for Avoidance, Speed, and Leech now provide about four
         times as much benefit per stat point.
       * All rings, neck, cloak, and trinket items that can be acquired in 
         Nagrand (A level 98+ zone) or later should now be better suited for the
         character's loot specialization. This means tanks should no longer
         receive items with no Bonus Armor and healers should no longer receive
         items with no Spirit from sources like item tokens, quests, or Personal
         loot mode in Dungeons and Raids for those item slots.
      
      RACIALS
      
       * Dwarf 
          *  [Stoneform] when used, now triggers a 30-second shared cooldown
            with other PvP trinkets that breaks crowd-control effects.
         
         
      
      CLASS CHANGES
      TALENT BALANCE
      
      Developer Commentary: A primary focus for class changes in Patch 6.1 is
      improving overall talent balance. Not every talent needs to be useful in
      every situation; and in fact it's often better if they have strengths and
      weaknesses. But we do try to have each talent be useful in some
      situations, and make them close enough in value that if you really enjoy
      the gameplay of a talent you don't feel like you're dragging your group
      down by using it.
      
      
      For these changes we focused primarily on tuning (tweaking numbers), and
      nearly all changes are buffs to underperforming talents. The goal is to
      reach more variety of viable builds, without bringing down the existing
      popular choices.
      
      
       * Death knight 
          * Talents 
             *  [Breath of Sindragosa] no longer has an initial Runic Power
               cost, but only applies the Mark of Sindragosa for Blood death
               knights.
             *  [Death Siphon] now heals the Death Knight for 400% of damage
               dealt (up from 335%).
             *  [Defile] now only reduces damage taken for Blood Death Knights.
             *  [Necrotic Plague] damage has been increased by 20% and now only
               grants Runic Power to Blood death knights.
            
            
         
         
       * Druid 
          * Talents 
             *  [Bristling Fur] (Guardian) now has a 30-second cooldown (down
               from 1 minute).
             *  [Force of Nature]'s Treants have been buffed with a 35% increase
               to their health and spellpower, and an 80% increase to their
               armor and attack power.
             *  [Guardian of Elune] (Guardian) now also reduces the rage cost of
               Savage Defense by the Druid's base dodge chance percentage.
             *  [Moment of Clarity] (Restoration) now lasts 7 seconds (up from 5
               seconds).
             *  [Rampant Growth] (Restoration) now also increases the healing of
               Swiftmend by 20%.
             *  [Renewal] now instantly heals for 30% of max health (up from
               22%).
             *  [Stellar Flare] (Balance) damage has been increased by 16%, and
               now has a duration of 24 seconds (up from 20 seconds).
            
            
         
         
       * Hunter 
          * Talents 
             *  [Barrage] damage has been increased by 21%.
             *  [Exhilaration] now instantly heals for 30% of max health (up
               from 22%).
             *  [Glaive Toss] damage has been increased by 25%.
             *  [Powershot] damage has been increased by 62%.
             *  [Stampede] now lasts 40 seconds (up from 20 seconds).
            
            
         
         
       * Mage 
          * Talents 
             *  [Alter Time] now has a 1-minute cooldown (down from 1.5
               minutes).
             *  [Comet Storm] (Frost) damage has increased by 94% but deals
               33.3% less damage in PvP combat.
             *  [Evanesce] should now provide protection against many more
               effects, and function more consistently.
             *  [Ice Nova] (Frost) now roots the target instead of stunning
               them, but the root is no longer affected by diminishing returns.
             *  [Mirror Image] copies of Frost mages now deals 15% less damage
               with [Frostbolt].
            
            
         
         
       * Monk 
          * Talents 
             *  [Ascension] now increases Spirit by 10% instead of increasing
               maximum mana by 20%.
             *  [Breath of the Serpent] (Mistweaver) healing increased by 50%.
             *  [Chi Burst] damage has been increased by 51%. Also fixed a bug
               that caused its damage and healing to vary based on
               specialization.
             *  [Chi Explosion] (Mistweaver) healing while in Serpent Stance is
               increased by 40%, and is now usable while channeling Soothing
               Mist. Healing while in Crane Stance is reduced by 33.3%.
             *  [Chi Torpedo] damage has increased by 150% and healing has
               increased by 42%.
             *  [Hurricane Strike] (Windwalker) damage increased by 25%.
             *  [Ring of Peace] now incapacitates all enemies for 5 seconds (up
               from 3 seconds).
             *  [Zen Sphere] has been improved. Its detonation damage has
               increased by 97%, detonation healing has increased by 70%, but
               periodic healing has been reduced by 39%. Also fixed a bug that
               caused its damage and healing to vary based on specialization.
            
            
         
         
       * Paladin 
          * Talents 
             *  [Empowered Seals] (Protection, Retribution) has been improved.
               Liadrin's Righteousness now increases haste by 20% (up from 15%).
               Uther's Insight now heals the Paladin for 2% of maximum health
               every 3 seconds (up from 1% every 2 seconds).
             *  [Execution Sentence]'s healing dealt by Stay of Execution has
               increased by 100%.
             *  [Final Verdict] (Retribution) now increases the radius of the
               next Divine Storm by 50% (down from 100%).
             *  [Hand of Purity] now reduces damage taken by 15% (up from 10%).
             *  [Sacred Shield]'s (Holy) mana cost has been reduced by 34%.
            
            
          * Glyphs 
             *  [Glyph of the Alabaster Shield] has been removed.
             *  [Glyph of Harsh Words] is now only available to Holy paladins.
            
            
         
         
       * Priest 
          * Talents 
             *  [Auspicious Spirits] (Shadow) no longer cause Shadowy
               Apparitions to not deal damage. Instead, it now increases Shadowy
               Apparition damage by 100% in addition to still granting 1 Shadow
               Orb.
             *  [Cascade] may now hit the same target twice. This results in an
               increase to total healing, so its healing has been reduced by 35%
               to compensate (the total healing in a 20-player raid will be
               slightly higher than before).
             *  [Clarity of Purpose]'s (Holy) healing has increased by 20%.
             *  [Divine Star] (Shadow) damage increased by 20%.
             *  [Halo] now displays an indicator on the ground to make it easier
               for the casting Priest see where the ability is most effective.
               Additionally, Halo's visual effect has been synchronized so a
               character will receive the effect when the nova intersects with
               them.
             *  [Insanity] (Shadow) now also affects Mind Sear.
             *  [Mindbender] lasts for 20 seconds (up from 15 seconds).
             *  [Psychic Scream] now has a 30-second cooldown (down from 45
               seconds).
             *  [Saving Grace]'s (Discipline, Holy) healing has increased by
               50%, but now reduces future healing dealt by 15% (up from 10%).
               Additionally, the talent is now instant-cast, but its
               effectiveness is reduced while in PvP combat.
             *  [Surge of Darkness] now has a 12% chance to trigger (up from
               10%).
             *  [Void Entropy] (Shadow) damage increased by 80%.
             *  [Void Tendrils]' health has increased by 30%.

             *  [Death from Above]'s damage has increased by 25%. For
               Assassination rogues, the talent now also increases the duration
               of Envenom.
             *  [Leeching Poison] has been redesigned. It now grants 10% Leech
               while active, and no longer applies a poison effect to the
               target. Its Shiv effect remains unchanged.
            
            
         
         
       * Shaman 
          * Talents 
             *  [Ancestral Guidance] now triggers from all damage or healing
               dealt, including Multistrikes, instead of only direct damage or
               healing.
             *  [Storm Elemental Totem] damage and healing has increased by 30%.
            
            
         
         
       * Warlock 
          * Talents 
             *  [Cataclysm] now also applies Unstable Affliction for Affliction
               Warlocks.
             *  [Charred Remains] (Destruction) now reduces Incinerate damage by
               only 50% (down from reducing Incinerate damage by 60%).
             *  [Demonbolt] (Demonology) damage decreased by 25%.
             *  [Grimoire of Sacrifice] (Affliction, Destruction) now increases
               damage of affected spells by 25% (up from 20%).
             *  [Grimoire of Service] now summons a second demon for 25 seconds
               (up from 20 seconds).
             *  [Kil'jaeden's Cunning] now has a 35-second cooldown (down from 1
               minute).
            
            
         
         
       * Warrior 
          * Talents

      HEALER DAMAGE
      
      Developer Commentary: Another change being made for Patch 6.1 is to bring
      the damage potential of healers up to a level that is sufficient and
      balanced. Healers' damage potential will still pale compared to that of a
      dedicated damage dealer or tank, but it should no longer feel like you're
      totally ineffective when attempting to do some outdoor content.
      
      
       * Druid 
          * Restoration 
             *  [Naturalist] now also increases the damage of Druid spells and
               abilities by 15%.
            
            
          * Talents 
             *  [Heart of the Wild] (Restoration) now increases spell damage by
               150% (down from 200%), and Agility in Cat Form by 75% (down from
               110%).
            
            
         
         
       * Paladin 
          * Holy 
             *  [Denounce] damage has increased by 50%.
             *  [Holy Shock] damage has increased by 50%.
            
            
         
         
       * Shaman 
          * Glyphs 
             *  [Telluric Currents] (Restoration) causes [Flame Shock], [Lava
               Burst], and [Lightning Bolt] to cost no mana and deal 100% more
               damage.
            
            
         
         
      
      CLASSES
      
       * Death knight 
          * Glyphs 
             *  [Glyph of Runic Power] now generates 2 Runic Power every second
               for 5 seconds when struck by a movement-impairing effect (down
               from 3 Runic Power).
            
            
          * Armor Sets 
             * PvP 4-piece set bonus for Blood death knights now only applies 
               [Anti-Magic Shell] to 1 additional ally within 15 yards (down
               from 2 allies).
            
            
         
         
       * Druid 
          * General 
             *  [Ferocious Bite] damage increased by 5%.
             *  [Healing Touch] no longer heals for 50% more when cast-on-self
               for Balance druids.
             *  [Mangle] damage increased by 27%.
             *  [Moonfire]'s mana cost has been reduced by 55%.
             *  [Shred] damage increased by 20%.
             *  [Thrash] (Cat Form) damage increased by 20%.
            
            
          * Balance 
             * Balance druids now learn a new passive ability at level 38,
               Nature's Bounty. 
                *  [Nature's Bounty] causes [Healing Touch] to be Critical
                  Strikes for 8 seconds after killing an enemy that yields
                  experience or honor.
               
               
             *  [Starfall] damage has decreased by 16.6%.
             * Starfall and [Sunfall] now only hits targets affected with 
               [Moonfire] or [Sunfire] by default. 
                *  [Glyph of Guided Stars] has been renamed to [Glyph of Untamed
                  Stars] and is now a Minor glyph. Glyph of Untamed Stars

               Spirit Link Totem, Stormstrike, and Unleash Life to have 2
               charges. Other abilities that reset the cooldown of these
               abilities will instead grant 1 charge.
             *  [Frozen Power] should no longer cause Frost Shock to trigger a
               new Mastery: Molten Earth (Elemental). Note that this does not

      QUESTS
      
       * Players in a raid group will once again no longer be eligible for quest
         credit, except for specially-designated Raid quests. We are continuing
         to explore ways of allowing players who want to engage in solo or
         small-group questing while in a raid group (for example, while waiting
         for a Highmaul raid to form, or in a Rated Battleground queue), without
         also allowing raid groups to trivially complete quests that were never
         designed with groups of that size in mind.

          * Improved the logic used for connecting flight paths. Players are now
            able to fly through flight points that they have not discovered yet
            if it'll result in a more direct flight path to a destination point.
          * A button has been added for characters in the middle of a flight to
            get off at the next known flight point.

         and seeking to enter Draenor may once again find him near the Dark
         Portal in Blasted Lands.
       * Spires of Arak 
          * Sethekk Wind Serpent is undead and should no longer be skinnable.

         Summit, and Sunwell Plateau along with a new achievement, Raiding with

       *  [Flask of Conquest] has been added as a potential drop at the end of a
         Rated Battleground match. The flask increases Conquest Point gains from
         Arenas and Rated Battlegrounds by 25% for 2 hours and the effect
         persists through death. The flask does not affect the character's
         Conquest cap and the drop chance is in addition to the existing chance
         for Conquest Points.
       * Battlegrounds now reward the appropriate level of experience at lower

    *  INTRODUCING THE WOW TOKEN
      
      Coming soon to an Azeroth near you: the WoW Token, a new in-game item that
      allows players to simply and securely exchange gold and game time between

      Players will be able to purchase a WoW Token through the In-Game Shop for
      real money, and then sell it on the Auction House for gold at the current
      market price. When a player buys a WoW Token from the Auction House for

      30 days of game time.

         adds in the framework needed for the WoW Token feature in the game

 * Unlock new appearances by collecting Soulbound weapons and armor your
   character can equip.
 * Unlocked appearances are account-wide and usable for transmogrification by
   other characters that can equip the item.

   automatically. Additional appearances will be unlocked based on
   previously-completed quests.
 * Transmogrifiers located in most major cities have been improved with

   Battleground, Rated Arena, Rated Battleground, or Ashran now receive an aura
   called Principles of War.
 * Principles of War removes all stats gained from gear (Strength, Stamina,
   Haste, etc.), disables gear related bonuses (like trinket effects and set
   bonuses), and gives the character stats based on their specializations, and
   increases based on overall item level. The goal is to provide a much more
   finely tuned and balanced PvP experience.

ARENAS

 * The pennant attached to the back of characters now changes its appearance
   based on the player's best rating in the Arena bracket.

   rewards such as weapons or relics.

      specific primary stat, and will remain relevant between specializations.
    * Spirit and Bonus Armor have been removed.

   with another secondary stat.

   combat interactions like auto-attacks as well as many melee class abilities.

TALENT SYSTEM CHANGES

 * Players may now change talents freely when in any rested XP area. The
   Inscription profession can craft consumable items that allow for this to be
   done in the field. In addition, after queuing into an instanced dungeon,
   raid, or PvP content, players have a grace period during which they may
   change talents freely.

GLYPH SYSTEM CHANGES

 * The Glyph panel has been removed from the game. Some minor glyphs that had a
   cosmetic effect that does not apply to a specific spell have been converted

 *  [The Human Spirit] has been redesigned. Human characters now gain 1% more of

   all sources. [It is believed the note is in error, as it was 1% in testing
   but increased to 2% when the patch went live.]

CLASS CHANGES

All classes and specializations have undergone changes to abilities and
mechanics. Check out our class preview logs for a better understanding on the
thought process behind these changes.


See Patch 7.0.3 (class changes) for a list.

NEW CONTENT
NEW KARAZHAN MYTHIC DUNGEON

From the moment of its mysterious creation, the purpose of this dark tower has
been intertwined with the history of the Guardians of Tirisfal, once Azeroth's
greatest bulwark against the Legion. It is now best known as the home of Medivh,
who tragically betrayed Azeroth and brought the unbroken chain of Guardians to
an end. This legacy makes Karazhan a place of particular interest for the
Legion, who have descended in full force in an effort to open a new front in
their war on the denizens of Azeroth.


Gather a party of five seasoned adventurers and return to this legendary dungeon
to face eight bosses on Mythic difficulty. It's an experience that may turn you
upside-down!

NEW TRIAL OF VALOR RAID

Since Loken's betrayal, Odyn has been trapped within the Halls of Valor as Helya
plots in the shadows to claim the souls of his valarjar champions. In recent
days, however, great heroes have arrived in the lands of Stormheim in the
Legion's wake. Hoping that their might and determination could tip the scales
and end Helya's reign, Odyn summons these champions for a final test.


This new three-boss raid dungeon completes the story of Stormheim. Odyn, Guarm,
and Helya will become available in Normal and Heroic difficulties two weeks
after the launch of Patch 7.1, with Mythic and Raid Finder Difficulties opening
afterward.

THE CONTINUING SURAMAR CAMPAIGN

Your heroic efforts in Suramar continue with a series of quests that unlock over
a period of nine weeks, ultimately leading you to the very entrance of the
Nighthold. Delve into the story of the Nightfallen insurrection against the
Nightborne and their Legion allies, and you can obtain the wondrous Arcanist's
Manasaber mount. Look for the quest "Lockdown" to get started.

NEW WORLD QUESTS

A new questline that will unlock Helarjar World Quests is now available. Look
for “A Call to Action” in Dalaran to discover the depth of Helya's influence on
all of the Broken Isles and contribute to the resistance.


Falcosaurs are here! The coastline of the Broken Isles is under assault from an
invasive, predatory species, and they're breeding out of control! Falcosaurs
drop Falcosaur Eggs and Falcosaur Feathers, reagents for new First Aid and
Cooking recipes. Save an Orphaned Falcosaur pet to begin a journey toward
understanding these hungry creatures, and you might find yourself with a unique
new mount.

LEVELING

In this patch, a large number of changes are made to improve the order and flow
of abilities gained while leveling all classes.


 * In many cases, the level 1-10 abilities that introduce the class have
   changed.
 * Many special bonuses and features for class abilities are now granted by
   upgrades that are learned at a later level.
 * This applies to every spec for every class other than Death Knights and Demon
   Hunters.
 * Examples:
    * Druids below level 10 now use [Wrath] and [Moonfire] as their primary
      damage abilities, rather than [Shred] and [Ferocious Bite].
    * While [Smite] will still be the first spell given to Priests at level 1,
      the added absorb shield effect will be an upgrade learned by Discipline at
      level 36, as the purpose of that effect is to add to healing in group
      content.
    * Rogues will start leveling with an ability that attacks with one weapon
      and generates one combo point. Rogues who choose Assassination
      specialization will replace that ability with [Mutilate] at level 40.

NEW FEATURES
THE BROKEN SHORE

Return to the Broken Shore and take the fight to the heart of the Legion's power
on Azeroth. Begin your journey in a new Scenario, and then lead the Armies of
Legionfall against the demonic invasion of Azeroth.


The dynamic ebb and flow of Broken Shore will keep you on your toes as new World
Quests, bosses, treasures, and a powerful demon command ship called the Sentinax 
make for an exciting new experience every day.


Join a region-wide, cross-faction effort to construct buildings that open new
content and provide a variety of benefits to help in the fight against the
Legion.

NEW DUNGEON: THE CATHEDRAL OF ETERNAL NIGHT

The upper chambers of the Tomb of Sargeras were once a place of worship to Elune
. Since the Legion's invasion, fel minions have desecrated this holy place,
twisting it into their own image. Now, this site will host a battle that could
turn the tide of the invasion. While the Armies of Legionfall engage the fel
army directly, a small group of heroes infiltrates the upper reaches of the
cathedral in a desperate hope to return the Aegis of Aggramar to its resting
place. Inside this new dungeon, you'll face:


 * Agronox - This ancient served the night elves priestesses of the Temple of
   Elune, tending the beautiful Hanging Gardens. But after the malevolence of
   the Legion infected the Cathedral, the guardian absorbed fel energy through
   his roots. Now the twisted Agronox spreads corruption throughout the
   sanctuary he once protected, believing he has finally achieved his ideal
   state.
 * Thrashbite the Scornful - Smashspite's detestable brother, Thrashbite has
   been dispatched to wipe out the mortals entering the cathedral's grand
   library. The dimwitted mo'arg lacks any respect for knowledge or learning,
   feeling petty satisfaction as he crashes through ancient artifacts and
   tramples priceless tomes.
 * Domatrax - With the Aegis of Aggramar socketed back into its cradle, Domatrax
   leads an onslaught of demons to destroy the relic.
 * Mephistroth - With the forces of Azeroth pushing against his front line,
   Mephistroth has fallen back to the Cathedral of Eternal Night, where he will
   employ all his cunning to ensure the heroes fail in securing the Aegis of
   Agrammar.


This new dungeon is available in Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic Keystone
difficulties.

CLASS CAMPAIGNS

After securing a foothold on the Broken Shore and making progress with the
Armies of Legionfall, every class continues its own campaign to unify in the war
effort. Your Class Hall will be the base from which you will embark on a new
quest chain, find a new potential Follower, and discover new class-specific
World Quests.


Once your class campaign and the Legionfall campaign on the Broken Shore are
complete, all new epic class mounts will become available to those who finish
the subsequent class mount quests.

DEMON ASSAULTS

The Burning Legion is preparing to assault Azeroth with renewed determination.
After you regain a foothold on the Broken Shore, don't be surprised if [[Broken
Isles] zones later come under attack. It will be up to you to fight to drive the
Legion back and defend the lands of your new allies.

FLYING IN THE BROKEN ISLES

Take your final steps to complete the [Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two] 
achievement to unlock flying in the Broken Isles.

LEGION REPUTATION PROGRESS

Reputation earned beyond Exalted will now contribute towards earning additional
rewards from Broken Isles faction emissaries. These new reward caches have a
rare chance to reward new faction mounts, such as the [Highmountain Elderhorn], 
[Wild Dreamrunner], and [Leywoven Flying Carpet].

PVP BRAWLS

A series of new twists on popular player-versus-player activities are on the
way. Starting with "Southshore vs Tarren Mill", "Gravity Lapse", and "Warsong
Scramble", PvP Brawls offer a variety of mode, rules, and scenic changes to the
usual Battleground gameplay. Look for the Brawl option in the Group Finder 
(default hotkey: i) Player vs. Player tab, under the Casual selection.

PET BATTLE DUNGEON

Something nefarious is going on in the world of pet battles, and it's worth a
closer look. If you have at least one level 25 battle pet, speak to Breanni in 
Dalaran to get directions to this new scenario.

UPDATED FEATURES
CHARACTER EMPOWERMENT

Your bond with your Artifact has grown stronger, and your Artifact Knowledge has
continued to increase. Upon reaching Artifact Knowledge 25, you will receive the
quest " [110] Seeking Lost Knowledge", which allows you to unlock further
knowledge levels. Additionally, once you have 35 or more traits in your
Artifact, the time has come to improve your Artifact even more. Unlock a set of
new empowered traits, additional ranks for many of your original traits, and a
new final trait by embarking on a new questline.


Your weapon isn't the only thing increasing in power. From dungeon drops to
World Quest rewards to items created with your professions, your armor upgrades
at higher item levels than before. All the better to fight the Legion!

TRANSMOGRIFICATION SETS

A new 'Sets' tab in the Appearances UI is where you'll find this new way of
tracking item sets from previous Raids, PvP Seasons, and more.

will no longer be able to accidentally tab to a target that is out of combat
with you, unless you are looking to a new target and your hostile enemies are
behind you. Furthermore, you're no longer able to tab to a target that neither

    *  [Thrash] (Bear) direct damage increased by 15%.
    *  [Swipe] (Bear) damage reduced by 25%.
       * Developers' Notes: This should result in overall Guardian damage
         remaining roughly the same, perhaps slightly higher. But it will
         frontload their damage more, which should help with burst threat.
      
      
   
   

HUNTER

 * Beast Mastery
    *  [Dire Frenzy] will now additionally cause your pet to charge up to 25
      yards toward the target.

PRIEST

    *  [Mental Fortitude] (Artifact Trait) shield cannot exceed damage absorbed
      of 4% of player total health (was 8%), and now correctly calculates
      healing from Vampiric Touch.

      existing duration, up to a maximum duration of 60 seconds.
    * Reap Souls (Artifact ability) now has a 5 second cooldown.
       * Developers' note: Previously, casting Reap Souls at 5 stacks (which
         would grant 25 seconds of the buff) with 20 seconds currently left on
         the buff would just overwrite your old 20 second buff with a 25 second
         buff. Now, in this case it will increase the buff duration to 45
         seconds.
      
      
    * Souls are now reset to 0 at the start of an encounter. The buff is also
      canceled at the start of an encounter. Ulthalesh now has a greatly
      increased chance to generate the first three Tormented Souls at the
      beginning of a raid encounter.
       * Developers' note: Souls are a resource, and we have a rules about
         resetting your resources/stacks of a buff before an encounter, so that
         every attempt is standardized. Having souls the first time you fight a
         raid boss feels good, but it makes every other attempt after that feel
         worse by comparison.

      opportunities for crowd control.

   seconds (was 10 seconds).
    * Developers' notes: This should eliminate the situation where players were
      waiting for Necrotic to fall off after killing enemies, and it should give
      tanks more opportunities for resets while in combat.

      Strikes changes is that Combat Potency should generate half as much
      Energy, twice as often.
   
   
 *  [Restless Blades] has returned. Finishing moves reduce the remaining
   cooldown on [Adrenaline Rush], [Between the Eyes], [Sprint], [Grappling Hook]

   Above], [Vanish] by 0.5 seconds per combo point spent.
 *  [Slice and Dice] now increases attack speed by 125% (was 100%).
 *  [Roll the Bones]
    * Developers' notes: The distribution of the number of buffs you get from

      when you get 1 buff.

    * Buried Treasure increases Energy regeneration by 30% (was 25%).

    * True Bearing causes Finishing moves to reduce the cooldown of many
      abilities by 1.0 seconds (was 2.0 seconds) per combo point.
   
   

SUBTLETY

 * Developers' notes: Our overall goals are to remove uncontrolled player
   teleport from the baseline DPS rotation, to reduce the frequency of
   teleporting in PvP, to allow players to choose between more frequent or more
   impactful Shadow Dances, which equates to more frequent CC/utility or damage
   in PvP, to keep the PvE rotation engaging, and to make [Symbols of Death] 
   more engaging.
 * All damage dealt increased by 20%.
 *  [Backstab] base damage increased by 35%.
 * Backstab damage bonus from being behind the target reduced to 20% (was 30%).
 *  [Dark Shadow] is a new talent at level 90: While Shadow Dance is active, all
   damage you deal is increased by 30%.
 *  [Deepening Shadows] now causes your finishing moves to reduce the remaining
   cooldown on Shadow Dance by 1.5 seconds (was 3 seconds) per combo point
   spent.
 *  [Energetic Stabbing] (Artifact trait) now has an increased proc chance of
   50% (was 25%), now refunds 2 Energy per point (was 5), and now also works
   with Backstab.
 *  [Enveloping Shadows] redesigned. Deepening Shadows reduces the remaining
   cooldown of Shadow Dance by an additional 1.0 second per combo point spent.
   Shadow Dance gains 1 additional charge.
 *  [Etched in Shadow] (Artifact trait) is now named [Weak Point]: Increases the
   critical strike damage of Backstab and [Shadowstrike] by 5% per point.
 *  [Feeding Frenzy] (Artifact trait) now lasts for 30 seconds (was 20 seconds).

   of [Sprint] by 10 seconds and [Vanish] by 30 seconds.
 *  [Gloomblade] damage increased by 10%.
 *  [Marked for Death]'s cooldown reduced to 40 seconds (was 60 seconds) for
   Subtlety.
    * Developers' notes: This is to balance it against [Premeditation], which is
      now on the same row. It's a buff in a raid setting, where the talent was
      very weak.
   
   
 *  [Master of Shadows] now gains 25 Energy over 3 seconds when you enter 
   [Stealth] or [Shadow Dance].
    * Developers' notes: Pooling energy going into a Shadow Dance has long been
      the way to play Subtlety, and we'd like to bring that back. This design
      still gives you more energy for a Shadow Dance, but in a way that allows
      the Rogue to fully utilize pooling gameplay.
   
   
 *  [Nightblade] now increases your damage dealt to the target by 15%, with
   damage over time component reduced by 35%.
    * Developers' notes: Further pushes Subtlety away from maintaining
      Nightblade on all secondary targets and instead into focusing their damage
      into 1 target. Additionally, gives Nightblade a mechanical interaction
      with the rest of the core rotation that fulfills the "setup" feel of
      Subtlety.
   
   
 *  [Premeditation] has been removed.
 *  [Relentless Strikes] now causes your finishing moves to generate 6 Energy
   per combo point spent.
 *  [Second Shuriken] (Artifact trait) damage increased by 200%.
 * Shadow Dance now has 2 charges (was 3), and is no longer on the global
   cooldown.
 * Shadow Dance's base duration increased to 4 seconds (was 3 seconds).
 *  [Shadow Nova] (Artifact trait) damage increased by 67%.
 *  [Shadow's Whisper] (Artifact trait) now increases Energy gain by 8 (was 5).
 *  [Shadowstep] now has 2 charges for Subtlety.
 *  [Shadowstrike] now hits at melee range (was a 15 yard range) and generates 2
   combo points (was 1).
 * Shadowstrike, when used while Stealthed, now deals 25% increased damage (was
   9%) and teleports you up to 25 yards behind your target. This does not happen
   while in Shadow Dance or during [Subterfuge].
 *  [Shuriken Combo] is a new passive talent available at level 70: [Shuriken
   Storm] increases the damage of your next [Eviscerate] by 10% for each enemy

NEW EVENTS IN TELDRASSIL AND LORDAERON

Beginning the week of July 24 and continuing for three weeks leading to the
launch of Battle for Azeroth on August 14, experience the escalation of all-out
war in Teldrassil, and later Lordaeron. A new chapter of the relentless conflict
at the heart of the Warcraft saga is unfolding, and it's time for you to take
your place on the front lines!

NEW CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATIONS

The war with the Burning Legion has left orcs standing tall, a new posture
option available to all orc player characters. Blood Elves now have access to
golden eyes, as well as a few new faces.


All of these new options are available at Barber Shops throughout Azeroth, and
you can now alter your character's skin color while you're there.

PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER

The PvP Honor and Prestige system has been updated. Your PvP progress in Legion 
has been converted into account-wide Honor levels, which you'll continue to earn
through PvP.


All class specializations' PvP Talents have been revamped. Hit default hotkey 'N
' to get a look at your PvP Talents, and default hotkey 'H' to see the new PvP
system.

WAR MODE IS HERE

You can now enable War Mode and venture out into a world full of others who have
made the same dangerous choice. Enabling War Mode provides additional bonuses:


 * All PvP Talents you've chosen will be available to use anywhere PvP can
   occur.
 * You'll gain an additional bonus to experience while leveling up.
 * Earn additional bonus gold and Resources from World Quests.


War Mode can be toggled on or off beginning at level 20 by visiting either 
Orgrimmar or Stormwind and setting your preference in the Talent pane (default
hotkey 'N'). Beware! Once you venture out in War Mode, all zones will become
contested, including zones such as Northshire Abbey.


Sanctuary areas will still be PvP free.


Additional War Mode features such as Bounty Hunter and Air Drops will become
available in the new zones of Battle for Azeroth.


July 17, 2018 marks the end of the final Legion season of ranked PvP, and the
post-season period has begun. Look for all the new PvP progression and rewards
to unlock and become earnable after the launch of Battle for Azeroth in a few
weeks.

headset icon wherever you see it in game to talk with other players.

the content, Legacy Loot rules will be automatically enabled. Under Legacy Loot
rules, drops will include a chance for all items that would drop for a full
party or raid at the instance's level.

CLASSES

Sargeras' cruel, final blow dramatically impacted both Azeroth and all of its
denizens. The power of every Artifact weapon has now been depleted. Some powers
from Artifacts have now been incorporated into their specializations. Your
characters that are just getting started in Legion content will still seek out
and acquire Artifacts.

STATISTICS

In an effort to make displayed numbers more perceptible, values used for player
and enemy statistics have been reduced throughout the game. This includes values
such as item-level, damage, armor, health, and defense measurements.


A number of spells and talents now again activate a global cooldown when used.


Blood Elves' [Arcane Torrent] now removes 1 beneficial effect from all nearby
enemies and restores 3% of your mana (previously silenced nearby enemies and

DESCRIPTION
January 22, 2019
For ages untold, Dazar'alor has stood at the center of the great and powerful 
Zandalari empire. Its guards have thwarted numerous attempts on King Rastakhan's
life, and it has endured trials both ancient and new. But as war reaches the
shores of Zuldazar, the Alliance embarks on a daring gambit to besiege the
golden pyramid and sever the Zandalari's bond to the Horde.

December 10, 2018
The war raging across Azeroth between Alliance and Horde has intensified. As the
Alliance lays plans to retake Darkshore and regain a foothold in Kalimdor, both
factions have redoubled their attacks across the zones of Kul Tiras and Zandalar
.

NEW RAID – BATTLE OF DAZAR'ALOR

The Battle of Dazar'alor is now open. The Alliance is set to stage an attack on
the heart of the Zandalari empire in a bid to sever the ties of the Zandalari
and the Horde, while Horde players will begin the raid by defending against an
invasion in the northern jungle of Zuldazar.


Along the way, players will get to shift to the other faction's perspective and
take on three additional bosses. For the first time in a raid, your character
will transform into the opposite faction (including their associated racial
abilities).


A dozen new, formidable boss encounters, including Lady Jaina Proudmoore and 
King Rastakhan himself, await you!


 * Mythic difficulty and Raid Finder Wing 1 will open with scheduled weekly
   maintenance in each region the week of January 29, 2019.
 * Raid Finder Wing 2 will open the week of February 12, 2019, and Raid Finder
   Wing 3 will open the week of February 26, 2019.

BATTLE FOR AZEROTH SEASON 2

Both the adventures and the war being waged across Azeroth are signified by
seasons: times at which many factors and measurements change. Today begins
Season 2 of Battle for Azeroth, and you'll find many new challenges and new
rewards are now available in Dungeons and PvP content.


 * Dungeons
    * A new season of rewards from dungeons has begun. Complete your best Mythic
      Keystone each week to earn higher item-level gear, and save up your Titan
      Residuum to purchase new, powerful Azerite items.
       * Item levels of rewards from level 120 Normal, Heroic, and Mythic
         dungeons have been increased by 30. Baseline rewards are now item-level
         340 from Normal, 355 from Heroic, and 370 from non-Keystone Mythic
         dungeons.
       * The difficulty of Heroic and Mythic dungeons has been increased by 30%.
         Normal difficulty dungeons are unchanged.
       * Mythic Keystones have been reduced by an additional 3 levels, to
         account for this difficulty increase.
       * Mythic Keystone rewards have been increased by 30 item levels. During
         the first week of Season 2, rewards from end-of-run chests will be
         capped at item-level 385, and the reward cache contains a Season 1
         reward.
       * Beginning the second week of Season 2, the weekly cache will not be
         affected by the cap, and will reward Season 2 items at the higher item
         levels.
       * Added a new Tier 3 Mythic Keystone affix: Reaping. This bestows the
         power of Bwonsamdi on all non-boss creatures in the dungeon, giving
         them a chance to avenge their own deaths.
       * The Infested affix has been removed.
      
      
   
   


 * Player versus Player
    * Battle for Azeroth PvP Season 2 is now underway. Ranks and ratings have
      been reset, and you can now begin earning new rewards.
       * Season 2 rewards from PvP sources have been increased by 30
         item-levels. This includes [Conquest] rewards and the weekly chest.
       * Players who earn 500 Conquest points in a given week now receive one 
         [Quartermaster's Coin] and an item from that week's selection.
       * Players might also earn an additional piece of gear or Quartermaster's
         Coin each week by using a weekly bonus roll token in PvP.
       * Quartermaster's Coins can be exchanged for a Warlord's Trophy, which
         can be used to upgrade a piece of Sinister Gladiator gear to a higher
         item level.
       * During weeks when the Conquest reward is a head, shoulder, or chest
         item, players can choose from one of four different pieces of Azerite
         gear. For the weeks when the Conquest reward is not an Azerite piece,
         trinket, or weapon, players will be able to choose gear from one of two
         different slots such as legs and wrists, hands and back, or finger and
         feet.
       * The PvP reward UI now shows the criteria needed to receive your weekly
         chest. Elite sets (available to earn for a limited time only) can also
         be viewed in the Appearances interface on the Sets tab.
       * Players can now work toward earning the [Vicious Black Bonesteed] or 
         [Vicious Black Warsaber]. Once earned, fill the bar again to receive a 
         [Vicious Saddle], which can be used to purchase a mount from previous
         seasons.
       * The Gladiator title and achievement are can now be earned by winning 50
         games in 3v3 Arenas above a 2400 rating. Players in the top 0.1% at the
         end of Season 2 in this bracket will earn the Sinister Gladiator title.
       * End-of-match rewards will be capped at item-level 385 during the first
         week of the season, to maintain parity with other endgame systems until
         Mythic Battle of Dazar'alor becomes available.
      
      
   
   


 * Items and Rewards Updates
    * New epic Azerite gear is now available from Season 2 PvP, the Battle of
      Dazar'alor raid, World Quest Emissaries, and from the Mythic Keystone
      vendor Thaumaturge Vashreen in Zuldazar and Boralus. These new items will
      have a fifth ring with additional new trait options, starting at Heart of
      Azeroth level 15.
    * The new ring of traits provides two choices of traits per specialization,
      allowing players the opportunity to find items that have traits they
      particularly want and the freedom to create new and interesting
      combinations that may not have been possible before.
    * Further changes to items and rewards include:
       * Azerite Knowledge will increase weekly from January 22 through March
         26.
       * The maximum possible item level is now 425 (was 395).
       * Seals of Wartorn Fate have not been changed or reset, and will be used
         for Battle of Dazar'alor and other Season 2 bonus rolls.
       * Emissary weapon and armor rewards will scale up to item-level 385 (was
         370).
       * Loot from Kul Tiras and Zandalar world bosses will remain at item-level
         355.
       * Rewards for in-progress emissary quests may reroll or update when
         Season 2 begins; the quests themselves won't reset or change.
       * The [Titan Residuum] vendor now offers item-level 385, 400, and 415
         gear.
       * Titan Residuum is not reset or capped between seasons.
       * Warfronts
          * Darkshore Warfront rewards have been increased by 15 item levels,
            and the outdoor world boss and the once-per-cycle quest now award
            item-level 400 gear.
          * The power of all enemies in the Darkshore Warfront have been
            increased by 15%, and the item level required to queue for Darkshore
            is now 335 (was 320).
             * Developers' notes: These Darkshore changes will take effect after
               the current Warfront cycle has ended. If an attack is already
               underway in your region, the Warfront will give Season 1 rewards
               until the attack phase ends. This is being done to avoid any
               unfairness to people who had already completed the Warfront or
               killed the world boss before the start of the new season.
            
            
          * Rewards from Arathi Basin and Stromgarde Warfront have not changed.

      Zuldazar to rejoin your faction's war efforts.
   
   
 * New Missions
    * Several new Missions are now available at both your War Table, as well as
      from new drops from various activities, such as Island Expeditions. Look
      for new Missions to upgrade your faction's outposts, level up followers so
      that they gain access to a new equipment slot, send your followers on
      lucrative new weekly treasure hunts, and unlock a vendor who offers the
      opposing faction's pets.
   
   
 * Faction Assaults
    * Periodically, the Alliance or the Horde will launch an assault against a
      hostile position in Kul Tiras or Zandalar. When an Assault is active, a
      group of new World Quests will be available to both factions in that area.

      Honorbound or 7th Legion Service Medals that can be exchanged for a
      variety of rewards.

      character will have Assault World Quests available to any of their other
      characters.
   
   

WARFRONT: THE BATTLE FOR DARKSHORE

 * The conflict over the home of the night elves has reached a fever pitch, and
   new questlines will lead you to the all-new Battle for Darkshore. In this new
   Warfront, you'll unlock access to powerful hero transformations that give you
   temporary abilities themed around your role as a tank, healer, or damage
   dealer.
    * Contributions for Darkshore as well as the Stromgarde Warfront now operate
      on a daily cycle. When resources are being mustered, three quartermasters
      will each put out a request for a different contribution each day. The
      requested turn-ins have also been adjusted to be more consistent in their
      value.
    * When your faction controls either Arathi Highlands or Darkshore, world
      quests will now be available in those zones, in place of the
      once-per-cycle kill quests that were previously offered for Arathi.
   
   

HERITAGE ARMOR QUESTLINES

 * New questlines to find and obtain new Heritage armor are available to two
   mighty races – the dwarves and the blood elves. Available at level 120 to
   dwarves who are Exalted with Ironforge and blood elves who are exalted with 
   Silvermoon, look for " [120] Keep Yer Feet On The Ground" at the Stormwind
   Embassy, or " [120] The Pride of the Sin'dorei" at the Orgrimmar Embassy, and
   get started rediscovering your heritage.

ISLAND EXPEDITIONS

   vrykul land of Jorundall and the Gilnean town of Havenswood. These, as well
   as the previous Island Expeditions, now feature new enemies, achievements,
   events, items, and vendors.
    * The logic used to spawn Island Expeditions has been adjusted to favor more
      organic concentrations of foes, with more clear paths in between, to make
      it easier to navigate without being forced into combat.
    * The chance for cosmetic rewards are now based on all the enemies and
      Azerite present on the island, and no longer tied to only the enemy camps
      your team defeats. Completing an Island Expedition at a higher difficulty
      increases the chance of receiving these bonus rewards.
    * Battle pets rewarded from the completion of islands that were previously
      uncageable can now be caged.
    * The weekly quest to recover Azerite now requires 36,000 Azerite (was

   all dungeon objectives (previously required only the last boss).
 * Several non-boss enemies have been removed in [Mythic Keystone] dungeons
   while Teeming is active.
 * Tormented Souls will now try to get closer to their target before casting
   Grave Bolt.
 * Many low health creatures in dungeons will no longer trigger On Death affixes
   in Mythic Keystone Dungeons, such as the Animated Droplets or Dredged Sailors 
   in Shrine of the Storm.
 * Kings' Rest
    * Mythic Keystone time limit increased by 3 minutes.

ITEMS

   reduced.
 *  [Incandescent Sliver] and [Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism] trinket buffs are
   now cleared consistently on encounter, arena, and battleground start.
    * Developers' notes: It was not our intention that these items require extra
      preparation prior to a boss pull. The Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism’s
      effect was already cleared at the start of a rated PvP match, so this
      change makes them both consistent between PvP and non-PvP encounters. We
      have increased the effect of the Sliver by 6% and the Prism by 15% to
      offset this change in behavior.
   
   
 * All Quest rewards from Classic through the Warlords of Draenor expansion now

         small delays between casting its spells.
       * Magus of the Dead's Frostbolt can now be dispelled.
      
      
    * Hunter
       * Beast Mastery
          *  [Feeding Frenzy]'s tooltip damage displayed has been lowered
            commensurate with Barbed Shot now ignoring armor. Its total
            effective damage remains unchanged.
         
         
      
      
    * Mage
       * Brain Storm now activates [Rule of Threes].
      
      
    * Monk
       * Windwalker
          * Glory of the Dawn now also deals 35% more damage during Storm,

    * Restoration
       * 
          *  [Ascendance] no longer replicates healing from Spouting Spirits.
         
         
      
      
    * Warlock
       * Demonology
          * Explosive Potential's Haste granted reduced by 35%.
         
         
      
      
   
   

PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER

 * Players who have earned their seasonal mount reward in rated PvP may now
   progress toward earning Vicious Saddles, up to a maximum of 10 Vicious
   Saddles per season.
 * Druid
    *  [Cyclone] mana cost reduced by 33%.
    *  [Thorns] mana cost increased by 50%.
   
   
 * Hunter
    *  [Tar Trap] will now break an enemy player out of stealth if they are the
      one to activate the trap.
   
   
 * Priest
    * Discipline
       *  [Premonition] now costs 500 mana (was 0 mana).
      
      
    * Holy
       * Holy Word: Concentration mana cost increased by 20%.
       *  [Ray of Hope] now costs 3000 mana (was 0 mana).
      
      
   
   
 * Warlock
    * Destruction
       *  [Demon Armor] now increases Armor by 150% (was 275%).
          * During Battle for Azeroth Season 1, we identified that Warlocks were
            taking too much damage from physical sources during PvP. We remedied
            this by adding a new PvP talent, Demon Armor, which increased their
            physical mitigation to match characters wearing Plate Armor. As
            we've been monitoring Season 2, we feel that the armor increase
            caused Warlocks to become too tanky in the current meta. This change
            effectively brings their physical mitigation close to that of Mail
            Armor (about 36% at ilvl 415), when it was previously similar to
            Plate Armor (about 45% at ilvl 415).

    *  [Sword and Board] now increases critical strike by the correct amount.

      Intellect] to that taught by the Kirin Tor.

    * Skinning beasts in the Monk class hall now awards Classic Skinning points.

    * Cooking Impossible

NEW ZONE: NAZJATAR

During a high-stakes chase across the seas, the Alliance and the Horde are
waylaid by an ancient enemy who's been lurking beneath the depths: Queen Azshara 
and her fearsome naga army. The naval forces of both factions are destroyed in
the ambush, and the survivors find themselves stranded in the ancient naga
domain of Nazjatar.


Soon after they arrive in Nazjatar, Alliance heroes will come upon a new faction
of deep-sea warriors, the Waveblade Ankoan, while Horde heroes will meet the 
Unshackled, a group of races who have escaped the naga's clutches. Both sides
offer champions who offer their services as combat allies and grow in power over
time as players prepare for their epic confrontation with Queen Azshara.


Adventurers who are level 120 and have unlocked Battle for Azeroth World Quests,
completing the quest " [120] Uniting Kul Tiras" or " [120] Uniting Zandalar,"
will receive a summon from either Genn Greymane or Nathanos Blightcaller,
kicking off the events that bring them to Nazjatar.

BENTHIC GEAR

Increase your power with Benthic gear, new upgradable armor that can now be
collected in Nazjatar. As you explore Nazjatar, you'll collect Prismatic
Manapearls—a soulbound currency that can be spent on Benthic tokens and
upgrades. These bind-to-account tokens can be used to gain a piece of upgradable
Benthic gear specific to your armor type (cloth, leather, mail, plate), starting
at item level 385. With enough time and effort, players can dedicate their
hard-earned Manapearls to upgrade pieces to ilvl 425, just shy of Heroic-level
raid gear (ilvl 430). Harnessing the power of the sea, each piece of Benthic
gear boasts a thematic bonus that activates in Nazjatar and the upcoming
Azshara's Eternal Palace raid. These bonuses might provide effects that boost
your damage, slow down your foes, or even increase your mount speed while
adventuring through this perilous region. Put together pieces to create a
powerful set for combat, collect a set optimized for exploration, or mix and
match to have the best from both worlds.

PRISMATIC MANAPEARLS

Defeating powerful enemies, completing quests, and plundering the treasures of
Azshara's minions may yield Prismatic Manapearls, concentrations of magical
energy highly prized by Nazjatar's denizens. Spend this new currency on many
different items within Nazjatar including Benthic tokens and upgrades for
Benthic gear, pets, and a mount. Earn Prismatic Manapearls by completing a
variety of activities such as World Quests and daily quests, looting treasure
chests, and slaying rare enemies.

NEW ZONE: MECHAGON ISLAND

Legends speak of a place off the craggy coast of Kul Tiras whose denizens have
replaced blood and bones with bolts and brass: Mechagon, home of a society of
mechanically augmented gnomes and their iron-fisted ruler King Mechagon. Heroes
who arrive upon Mechagon's shores will soon meet Prince Erazmin and the Rustbolt
Resistance, and after completing a series of new faction-based quests, they'll
join their fight to overthrow Erazmin's tyrannical father and put an end to his
mad designs.


Players can rise in power and earn the trust of their new allies by
participating in new daily quests and other activities unique to Mechagon. These
include collaborative Construction Projects that allow players to contribute
resources to create a variety of powerful constructs, including experimental
weapons, flame turrets, a drill rig that can uncover a cave full of treasures,
and more.


After establishing a hub in Nazjatar and empowering their [Heart of Azeroth],
players will make their way to Mechagon by starting the quest " [120] The Legend
of Mechagon," which can be accepted by Alliance players in Boralus and Horde
players in Dazar'alor near each city's respective Flight Masters.

JUNKYARD TINKERING

As they traverse the zone, players will have access to Pascal-K1N6, a giant iron
robot who will help players craft equipment, mounts, toys, consumables, and more
in exchange for Spare Parts and Energy Cells found across Mechagon. Recipes to
craft more items can be found around the island.

POCKET-SIZED COMPUTATION DEVICE

The [Pocket-Sized Computation Device] is a trinket that players can customize
via three Punchcard Sockets, into which players can insert one Red, Yellow, and
Blue Punch Card. Punch Cards can be collected by questing, exploring the
Mechagon zone, and advancing through the new Mythic-only dungeon Operation:
Mechagon. Players will receive their Pocket-Sized Computation Device after
completing the " [120] Upgraded" quest, available shortly after landing in
Mechagon.

NEW RAID: AZSHARA'S ETERNAL PALACE

Battle against Nazjatar's worthiest champions, face down unfathomable
monstrosities from the deep, and confront the legendary Queen Azshara herself in
this sprawling 8-boss raid.


Learn more about the bosses guarding Azshara's Eternal Palace here.


Azshara's Eternal Palace Normal and Heroic difficulties will open on July 9, two
weeks after Rise of Azshara goes live on June 25. Raid Finder Wing One and
Mythic will open the following week on July 16.

NEW DUNGEON: OPERATION: MECHAGON

Level 120 players will unite with Prince Erazmin and the Rustbolt Resistance to
help overthrow his deranged father and destroy his Mechoriginator doomsday
device in this new 8-boss "mega-dungeon." This Mythic-only instance will be open
to players after they complete new faction-based quests for the Rustbolt
Resistance. Great rewards await you in Mechagon, but bear in mind that
gnome-crafted loot might have some surprising properties...


Operation: Mechagon will open to players at the start of Season 3, July 9, after
accepting the quest "Operation: Mechagon – The Mechoriginator."

HEART OF AZEROTH SYSTEM UPDATE: ESSENCES

Infuse the might of the Titans into your [Heart of Azeroth] with Essences. These
powerful active and passive abilities allow you to customize your playstyle in a
whole new way. Each Essence possesses a Major Power (usually a new active
ability) and a Minor Power (which is always passive). The Heart of Azeroth has
slots for one Major and two Minor Essences. Place an Essence in the Major slot
to activate both its Major and Minor Powers, and place up to two in the Minor
slots to activate their Minor Powers. Adapt to conquer any situation by applying
or swapping them out within rest areas, cities, or when using items such as the
Tome of Quiet Mind.


Grow in power each time you unlock one of four ranks for your Essence. At Rank
1, an Essence's Major and Minor effects are available, while Rank 2 and Rank 3
enhance those Major and Minor effects. Rank 4 adds a flashier cosmetic effect to
an Essence's Major Power, providing a distinctive appearance that will make its
wielder stand out from the crowd. Earn Essences by completing specific
activities, including PvP, raiding, or engaging in World Quests. Some Essences
are specific to a role (damage dealer, tank, or healer), and some are usable by
any role. After acquiring an Essence, you'll be able to hover your mouse over
the Essence in the user interface to see information about the next rank and how
to acquire it.


Players will need to complete a new quest line to unlock the Heart Forge before
infusing Essences into the Heart of Azeroth. This will unlock the Major slot,
and will reward them with their first Essence. The two Minor slots will unlock
at Heart of Azeroth levels 55 and 65 respectively. Players with a Heart of
Azeroth below level 35 will have it raised to level 35 upon unlocking the Heart
Forge.


Level 120 players who have established their new hub in Nazjatar will be invited
to join Magni at the Chamber of Heart in Silithus to start the new quest line to
unlock the Heart Forge, beginning with the quest " [120] Essential Empowerment."

MOUNT EQUIPMENT

Have you ever wished that your favorite mount could carry you across the water
without sinking? Give most of your mounts more speed, daze prevention, a
parachute, or water walking with mount equipment! Upon reaching level 100 on one
character, a new mount equipment slot will become available in the Mounts
interface on all characters. Mount equipment can be crafted by Enchanters, 
Tailors, and Leatherworkers and can be listed in the Auction House or purchased
directly from the artisans themselves. Players that already have Water Strider
mounts should check their mailbox for one free piece of water-walking mount
equipment.


Note that mounts do not benefit from mount equipment in battlegrounds or Arenas 
and that some do not benefit from mount equipment at all such as the [Sky Golem]
.

NEW QUESTS

A host of new stories and adventures are now available across Azeroth.

MAGNI BRONZEBEARD

Mysterious magics have awakened across Azeroth. Among them are the essences of
the five dragonflights, which Magni Bronzebeard suspects can unlock the full
potential of the Heart of Azeroth. Level 120 players should heed Magni's call to
continue the story and earn their first Essence, which grants a new, powerful
ability tailored to their character's role (damage dealer, healer, or tank) or
all roles.

WAR CAMPAIGN: STAY OF EXECUTION

Upon learning of Sylvanas's plans to execute Baine Bloodhoof for treason, the
Alliance and the Horde send strike teams to infiltrate the Kor'kron Barracks and
rescue the noble tauren chieftain—meeting up with an old orcish ally along the
way.


The latest episode of the War Campaign is available to level 120 players who
have completed the previous chapters and finished the quest "Clearing out the
Cache." Speak to Lady Jaina Proudmoore or Lor'themar in Nazjatar to begin this
perilous mission.

NEW HERITAGE ARMOR: GNOMES AND TAUREN

Delve deeper into the lore of the gnomes and the tauren and unlock Heritage
Armor that reflects their legacies. Level 120 tauren or gnome players who are
Exalted with their faction (Gnomeregan or Thunder Bluff respectively) will be
able to embark on a quest line that explores their race's history. Once
completed, players will gain a new Heritage Armor transmogrification set usable
by all their characters of the same race.


Eligible gnomes and tauren can begin the quest by speaking with their race's
ambassador in their faction's Embassy in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. Those seeking
the tauren Heritage Armor will additionally to be tasked with freeing Baine in
the War Campaign quest " [120] Stay of Execution" (on any character on their
account) before beginning their quest line.

NEW EPIC BATTLEGROUND: ASHRAN

Once home to a mighty ogre empire, the ruins of Ashran hold ancient artifacts
infused with great power that could turn the tide of war. Return to Draenor and
fight on familiar turf in a brand-new 40v40 Epic Battleground: Ashran.


Starting at level 100, players can clash with the enemy faction on the main road
of Ashran, carving a warpath into the enemy's stronghold. After either slaying
700 enemy reinforcements or successfully invading the stronghold, players will
come together to bring down the enemy faction leader—the Alliance's Grand
Marshal Tremblade or the Horde's High Warlord Volrath. Collect Ancient Artifacts
, Artifact Fragments, Class Spellbooks, and other items to improve your chances
of victory. Gathering Artifact Fragments from fallen foes will allow you to
summon elite allies, Fangraal and Kronus, to lead your faction's charge into
battle.


Players will find and be able to queue for Ashran in the Epic Battleground 
section of the Group Finder (default hotkey: i).

NEW ISLAND EXPEDITIONS

Set sail and discover two new Islands: Crestfall and Snowblossom Village. New
loot including armor, weapons, and pets awaits players, but beware: you're not
alone. Faction rivals will want to hoard the spoils for themselves. Take them
down!

NEW MISSIONS AND MECHANICS
NEW MISSIONS AND TROOPS

As you take the fight to the seas, your loyal followers will be with you every
step of the way. You can now enlist Boat Captains and other skilled seafarers to
fight your battles.

EVENT AND HOLIDAY MISSIONS

Send out your followers to embark on new holiday- and event-themed missions.
Spoils will include special currencies to spend during holidays and events,
including Brewfest and Timewalking, along with rewards that are only available
during those periods.

FLYING IN KUL TIRAS AND ZANDALAR

The once-forbidden skies of Kul Tiras and Zandalar will soon be open to heroes
eager to take flight. The achievement [Battle for Azeroth Pathfinder, Part Two] 
will allow daring adventurers to take to the skies in Battle for Azeroth's
zones, including in the new ones, Mechagon and Nazjatar. Hardy adventurers will
need to earn Revered reputation with the Rustbolt Resistance and with their new
Nazjatar allies (The Waveblade Ankoan or The Unshackled), explore Mechagon and
Nazjatar, and complete the first part of the meta-achievement, [Battle for
Azeroth Pathfinder, Part One].


Adventurers who complete these requirements and unlock flying will also be
rewarded with a mechanical parrot mount: Wonderwing 2.0.

MOUNTS

Ride through Nazjatar and Mechagon in style as you collect several new aquatic-
and mechanical-inspired mounts. Six of them are listed below, but there are even
more waiting to be discovered!

AZSHARI BLOATRAY

Raised in captivity, these yellow aquatic creatures' gas organs are harvested by
the naga to allow them to breathe air more easily. Players will rescue one to
use as their personal mount after earning the achievement Glory of the Palace
Raider.

 [CRIMSON TIDESTALLION]

These blood-red, spirited creatures gracefully flit through the water, carrying
heroes swiftly through the sea. Crimson Tidestallions can be purchased from
Murloc Trader Mrrl in Nazjatar in exchange for several eclectic items after
completing the quest "A Safer Place."

ROYAL SNAPDRAGON

Fierce and loyal companions, blue Royal Snapdragons are snatched from the wild
at a young age and raised to serve naga hunters. Claim your own by vanquishing
high-ranking naga in Nazjatar.

X-995 MECHANOCAT

Crafted through Junkyard Tinkering, these robotic cats can be painted a variety
of colors, which players can collect during their adventures in Mechagon.

 [SCRAPFORGED MECHASPIDER]

Planet-conscious players who complete the quests given by Recycler Kerchunk in
Rustbolt will be rewarded with this mount.

MECHACYCLE MODEL W

This mechanical marvel is the pinnacle of supercharged street performance in
mechagnome travel. Boasting the best in aerodynamic performance, this gorgeous
wheel will be gifted to players who complete the achievement Mecha-Done.

PET BATTLES

A new challenge awaits your army of fierce little companions in Rise of Azshara.

PET BATTLE DUNGEON: STRATHOLME

It's time to marshal your menagerie and put your best battle pets forward within
the halls of Stratholme, a new Pet Battle Dungeon with Normal and Challenge
difficulties. Those who prove themselves to be the very best will earn an
Ultimate Battle-Training Stone after defeating the dungeon on Normal difficulty.
Completing it on Challenge difficulty will grant the achievement Pet Battle
Challenge: Stratholme along with the Minimancer pet. To get started on your
journey, you'll need to have earned the achievement All Growns Up! (have one
level-25 pet) for Normal difficulty or Pro Pet Group (have 15 level-25 pets) for
Challenge difficulty. Seek out Tizzy Gearjolt in Boralus or Radek Fuselock in
Dazar'alor to get started.

TRANSMOGRIFICATION UPDATES

Players can now make all armor slots hidden, except Legs. Let's keep it classy.


Additionally, several items are now eligible for transmogrification, including 
[Cookie's Tenderizer], [Direbrew's Shanker], and [Nat's Hat].

BREWFEST UPDATE

Get ready to crack open a cold one with friends new and old during our revamped
Brewfest! Sample brews across Azeroth and beyond with representatives of every
playable race, including your newest Kul Tiran and Zandalari allies. Brawl with
alementals, Dark Iron dwarves, and cheeky hozen to keep the peace during the
booziest time of year. Prove just how gutsy you are by entering the Brewfest
Chowdown sausage-eating contest or playing other mini-games to win spectacular
prizes, including a [Bottomless Brewfest Stein], [Garland of Grain], [Tabard of
Brew], [Brewfest Chowdown Trophy], or the [Brewfest Reveler's Hearthstone].

BRAWLER'S GUILD

 * The Strange Thing encounter is now easier to defeat.

CLASSES

 * Death Knight
    * Frost
       *  [Runic Empowerment] has a 2% chance to proc per Runic Power spent (was
         1.5%).
       *  [Icecap] now reduces [Pillar of Frost] cooldown by 2 seconds (was 1
         second).
       *  [Frost Fever]'s chance to generate Runic Power increased to 30%.
          * Chance now diminishes on targets beyond the first.
         
         
       *  [Frost Strike] damage increased by 15%.
       *  [Breath of Sindragosa] damage reduced by 10%.
       * Breath of Sindragosa now generates 2 Runes when cast, and another 2
         when the effect expires.
       * Breath of Sindragosa costs 16 Runic Power per second (up from 15).
          * Developers' notes: Frost was starved of resources too often,
            especially when using Breath of Sindragosa. This increases Frosts'
            Rune income baseline and includes a further change that returns many
            extra Runes while using Breath of Sindragosa. Breath builds will now
            be able to fill more global cooldowns with casts of [Obliterate] to
            make up for the lost Frost Strikes. The cost of Breath itself is
            increased to keep its overall duration roughly unchanged.
         
         
      
      
    * Unholy
       *  [Festering Strike], [Scourge Strike], [Festering Wound], [Death Coil],
         and [Clawing Shadows] damage increased by 15%.
       *  [Army of the Dead]'s Ghoul damage increased by 6%.
          * Developers' notes: Previously, a bug allowed Army of the Dead
            Ghouls' Energy to benefit doubly from Haste. To compensate for the
            effects of the bug fix, we've increased their damage to keep it
            consistent.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Demon Hunter
    * Havoc
       *  [Mastery: Demonic Presence] damage bonus increased by 20%.
       *  [Chaos Strike] and Trail of Ruin damage reduced by 4%.
          * Developer's notes: Previously Mastery was relatively weak when
            compared to other secondary stats. By increasing Mastery's effect
            for Havoc, it should now be a more desirable stat on gear. To
            balance this upcoming power increase, we've slightly reduced the
            damage output of Chaos Strike and Trial of Ruin.
         
         
      
      
    * Vengeance
       *  [Demonic Wards] damage reduction increased to 15% (was 10%).
       * Demonic Wards armor bonus increased to 100% (was 80%).
       *  [Demon Spikes] armor reduced to 60% of Agility (was 85%).
       *  [Soul Cleave] damage increased by 40%.
          * Developers' notes: More so than other tanks, Vengeance Demon Hunters
            are currently dealing with the problem of low mitigation when their
            active mitigation is down. These changes provide a substantial
            increase to physical mitigation when Demon Spikes is down, and a
            neutral-to-very-slight increase when Demon Spikes is active. The
            changes also provide some overall passive reduction to magic damage.
            Overall, the amount of sustained damage Vengeance takes will be
            lower, and the periods of vulnerability outside of Demon Spikes
            should be less dramatic.
         
         
      
      
    * Metamorphosis
       * Health bonus is now 50% (was 30%).
       *  [Shear] now generates 20 additional Pain and 1 additional Lesser Soul
         Fragment (was: generates 7 Pain per second).
          * Developers' notes: This significantly increases the health bonus,
            damage mitigation, and self-healing potential of Metamorphosis, as
            well as the health buffer, making it a more reliable major cooldown
            against all types of damage.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Druid
    *  [Soothe], [Remove Corruption], [Moonfire], and [Rebirth] are no longer
      castable in Cat or [Bear Form] by default.
    * Feral Druids now have a passive ability learned at level 22 that allows
      Remove Corruption and Soothe to be cast in Cat Form.
    * Guardian Druids now have a passive ability learned at level 10 that allows
      Soothe, Remove Corruption, Moonfire, and Rebirth to be cast in Bear Form.
       * Developers' notes: Guardian Druid is limited in its practical ability
         to use some utility abilities while tanking, and we're loosening that
         restriction by allowing Remove Corruption in Bear Form. We're also
         cleaning up Druid shapeshifting rules slightly: the use of
         magical-themed spells in beast forms is allowed by passive upgrades
         given to Guardian and Feral specializations specifically. This
         represents their special mastery of their "home" form that allows for
         limited spellcasting, and from a gameplay perspective, this allows
         Feral and Guardian Druids to use spells in-form when there is a strong
         practical need. At the same time, in situations where there is no
         fantasy justification or gameplay need, it makes sense for spellcasting
         to be more restricted. For example, non–Guardian Druids can no longer
         cast Moonfire in Bear Form.
      
      
    * Guardian
       *  [Ironfur] now has a maximum of 8 stacks.
       * Ironfur and [Maul] now cost 40 Rage (was 45).
       *  [Mangle] now generates 10 Rage (was 8).
          * Developers' notes: Ironfur is intended to be maintainable with high
            uptime (up to 100%) and have some overlaps on top of that.
            Currently, depending on talent configuration, Druids may only be
            able to barely maintain full uptime on Ironfur. Making Ironfur much
            more available should allow better control over timing and overlaps,
            as well as improving Guardian mitigation overall.
         
         
       * Shifting to [Bear Form] now gives 25 Rage (was 20).
          * Developers' notes: It should now be much easier to get the first
            Ironfur activated promptly after engaging an enemy, due to the
            increased starting Rage and lower cost.
         
         
       * Mangle and [Thrash] direct damage increased by 15%.
       *  [Frenzied Regeneration] (Rank 3) is learned at level 85.
       * Frenzied Regeneration's healing has been increased by 33%.
      
      
    * Restoration
       * Casting [Overgrowth] while [Soul of the Forest] is active will now
         increase the healing of Overgrowth's [Rejuvenation], instead of its 
         [Regrowth] heal over time effect.
      
      
   
   
 * Hunter
    * Horridon is now tamable by Hunters of any specialization.
    * Beast Mastery
       * Barbed Shot damage is now affected by [Bestial Wrath].
       * Barbed Shot damage reduced by 10%.
       * Oondasta is now tamable by Beast Mastery Hunters.
          * Developers' notes: We are fixing a bug that caused Bestial Wrath to
            not affect Barbed Shot damage, and lowering the base damage of
            Barbed Shot to keep overall damage roughly unchanged.
         
         
      
      
    * Survival
       * Mastery: Spirit Bond damage bonus increased by 20%.
          * Developers' notes: Previously Mastery was relatively weak when
            compared to other secondary stats. By increasing the power of
            Mastery's effect for Survival, it should now be a more desirable
            stat on gear.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Mage
    * Frost
       *  [Mastery: Icicles] damage bonus increased by 15%.
       *  [Glacial Spike] base damage reduced by 7%.
          * Developers' notes: Previously Mastery was relatively weak when
            compared to other secondary stats. By increasing Mastery's effect
            for Frost, it should now be a more desirable stat on gear. To
            balance this upcoming power increase, we've slightly reduced the
            damage output of Glacial Spike.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Priest
    * Shadow
       *  [Auspicious Spirits] now increases Shadowy Apparition damage by 50%.
       *  [Shadow Word: Pain] damage reduced by 9%.
       *  [Vampiric Touch] damage reduced by 9%.
          * We believe damage-over-time specializations that maintain a variety
            of DoT spells should in general output more damage in encounters
            with multiple targets than single-target oriented specializations.
            In addition to measuring class specializations against others, we
            must also balance them across the entire spectrum of content. Due to
            the types of encounters in Tides of Vengeance, Shadow Priests were
            especially strong in some contexts and correspondingly weak in very
            few situations when compared to similar DoT specializations. As
            such, we're slightly pulling back on the abilities that proc Shadowy
            Apparition, which is the prominent contributor of making Shadow
            Priests significantly stronger than similar counterparts.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Rogue
    * Outlaw
       * Keep Your Wits About You (Azerite Trait) now stacks once per instance
         of [Blade Flurry] dealing damage (was once for every target Blade
         Flurry hits). Each stack now provides 5% [Sinister Strike] chance (was
         2%).
          * Developers' notes: In very large packs of enemies, especially in
            dungeons, Keep Your Wits About You provides much more damage than
            one copy of one Azerite Trait was intended to provide. With this
            change, you'll still feel this trait accelerate as you build stacks,
            but the size of the group that you're fighting won't affect how much
            damage the trait is giving you. This will be a damage increase
            against two targets, and a damage reduction against 3 or more
            targets.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Shaman
    * Enhancement
       * The Molten Weapon buff from the Elemental Spirits talent now only
         modifies the Fire damage of your class abilities, instead of modifying
         all Fire damage dealt.
          * Developers' notes: With the addition of the new Azerite Essences in
            the Rise of Azshara content update, many of which deal Fire damage,
            we did not want to make this talent feel mandatory. Prior to this
            change, the Molten Weapon buff from the fiery Spirit Wolf would have
            increased the damage dealt by several Azerite Essences. The buff
            effects from Elemental Spirits talent are intended to increase your
            class abilities, and still will after this change.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Warrior
    * Arms
       *  [Execute], [Mortal Strike], [Rend], and [Slam] damage increased by 6%.
       *  [Mastery: Deep Wounds] damage bonus increased by 12%.
          * Developers' notes: Previously Mastery was relatively weak when
            compared to other secondary stats. By increasing the power of
            Mastery's effect for Arms, it should now be a more desirable stat on
            gear.
         
         
      
      
    * Protection
       * Unstoppable Force [Thunder Clap] damage reduced to 30% (was 100%).
          * Developers' notes: Protection Warrior burst DPS with Avatar is
            extremely high for a tank. This talent was adding more damage than
            necessary, given that it also decreases Thunder Clap's cooldown and
            synergizes well with certain Azerite traits.

      reduced to 5 for characters with a level of 104 or greater on all raid

 * Some powerful consumable items such as the Demolisher and Siege Engine have
   returned to PvP Island Expeditions. These items can now be collected,
   repaired, and fought over throughout the island.
 * The rotating Seafarer's Dubloon vendors who previously sold these consumables
   now have new items to offer.

ITEMS AND REWARDS

 * Artifact Power
    * Azerite values have been adjusted to allow players to get more of their
      total Artifact Power from the below sources.
       * Dungeons
          * Mythic Keystone Dungeon Weekly Cache now rewards 3800 AP (was 1900).

 * Gear Scaling
    * Most item effects that deal damage or healing now scale based off of a
      character's secondary stat (was primary stat).
       * Developers' note: We made some under-the-hood changes to how item
         effects that deal damage, healing, and shielding scale with item level.
         The net effect of these changes is that almost all items like this in
         Battle for Azeroth are now moderately stronger. The difference is
         greater the higher the item level of the item. This includes items from
         Battle for Azeroth dungeons, raids, and PvP rewards.
      
      
   
   
 * Heart of Azeroth
    * The Personal Absorb-O-Tron Azerite Trait will now absorb 50% of damage
      taken over 20 seconds (was 100%). The total amount of damage absorbed by
      this trait remains unchanged.
    * Paladin
       * Holy
          * Developers' note: This build has gotten far enough ahead of other
            Holy Paladin options, as well as other healers in some cases, that
            we're paring it back while leaving the gameplay generally unchanged.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Players in Nazjatar can now ride underwater mounts on land with Budding
   Deepcoral.
 * A Tiny Clockwork Key allows Pepe to sometimes dress up as mechanical bird.
 * Some heirlooms have been renamed to be more faction-specific.
    * Bolstering War Horn has been renamed to Dwarven War Horn (Alliance) and
      Orcish War Horn (Horde).
    * Bolstering War Horn has been renamed to Dwarven War Horn (Alliance) and
      Orcish War Horn (Horde).
    * Cloak of Hardened Steel has been renamed to Banded Gilnean Cloak
      (Alliance) and Stone Guard's Bladed Cloak (Horde).
    * Dusk Powder has been renamed to Kaldorei Powder of Twilight (Alliance) and
      Deathstalker's Gloaming Powder (Horde).
    * Enchanted Scroll has been renamed to Tidesage's Warscroll (Alliance) and
      Loa-Touched Warscroll (Horde).
   
   

LEVELING

 * Players who manually group with a player that has turned off experience gains 
   will now receive 95% less experience.
    * Developers' note: This change does not impact players who find themselves
      automatically grouped by matchmaking for activities like Group Finder
      dungeons or Island Expeditions.
   
   

PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER

 * Arena
    * Tiger's Peak has finished repairs and is once again available as an Arena
      map.
    * Team colors have been changed from gold and green to gold and purple.
   
   
 * Battlegrounds
    * Alterac Valley
       * UI now tracks progress for summoning Lokholar the Ice Lord and Ivus the
         Forest Lord.
       * Two seasonal quests have been added to Alterac Valley. These quests,
         similar to the ones offered in Wintergrasp, will reset and are
         repeatable each season.
      
      
    * Seething Shore
       * When the battleground begins, the same three nodes will always be in
         the first wave (Ridge, Ruins, and Tar Pits).
       * Players who use the jetpack's Thrust ability while airborne now travel
         further.
      
      
   
   
 * Enlistment Bonus
    * Now rewards 50% more Azerite Power for participating in Random
      Battlegrounds and Epic Battlegrounds.
       * Developers' note: Battleground queue times become exceedingly long when
         one faction has more people queuing than the other. When queue times
         exceed a certain threshold, Mercenary Mode becomes available for the
         faction with long queue times and the Enlistment Bonus becomes
         available for the less represented faction. Now, the Enlistment Bonus
         will increase the amount of Azerite Power from Random Battlegrounds and
         Random Epic Battlegrounds by 50%.
      
      
   
   
 * Items
    * Void Stone's absorption ability has been reduced by 30% for healers and
      60% for non-healers in PvP.
    * Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism personal absorption shield has been reduced
      by 30% for tank specializations and 60% for non-tank specializations in
      PvP.
    * Abyssal Speaker's Gauntlets absorption shield is now reduced by 80% in PvP
      (was 66%).
    * Trident of the Deep Ocean absorption shield is now reduced by 75% in PvP
      (was 50%).
    * Mindthief's Eldritch Clasp healing and self-damage effect is now reduced
      by 50% in PvP.
       * Developers' note: Several Crucible of Storms raid items had a
         significant impact on the PvP meta in Season 2. We believe that raid
         items in PvP can be a meaningful source of gameplay variety that
         contribute to each season feeling a bit different than ones before it.
         Due to the nature of our PvP scaling system, which helps make PvP more
         accessible for more players, means the effects of these items will
         remain relevant longer than we'd like. Therefore, we're reducing the
         effectiveness of these items in the new patch so players can feel good
         about transitioning to new items they acquire in Season 3.
      
      
    * Horde and Alliance Glider Kits now have a prideful new look.
    * All racial abilities that share a cooldown with Honorable Medallion now
      only display corresponding information when the talent is selected.
   
   
 * Death Knight
    * Frost
       * Chill Streak no longer deals damage based on the target's (or caster's)
         maximum health.
       * Chill Streak now deals an additional percent of Attack Power per bounce
         to applicable targets (up to 9%).
       * Chill Streak no longer adheres to the maximum health percentage PvP
         talent restrictions.
       * Chill Streak can now critical strike, scale with your increased damage
         modifications (e.g. Mastery), and benefit from damage taken debuffs
         applied on the target.
          * Developers' note: We're changing Chill Streak from damage based on
            the target's maximum health to one based on the Death Knight's
            attack power. This has the effect of dealing damage more equally
            against targets of any health range.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Druid
    * Restoration
       * Casting Overgrowth while Soul of the Forest is active will now increase
         the healing of Overgrowth's Rejuvenation, instead of its Regrowth heal
         over time effect.
          * Developers' notes: Overgrowth applies both Rejuvenation and
            Regrowth's heal over time effect, but Soul of the Forest will only
            effect one of them. We're adjust the interaction of these two spells
            to more accurately match players expectations of their synergy.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Monk
    * Brewmaster
       * Hot Trub now splits its damage among all enemies hit.
      
      
   
   
 * Paladin
    * Protection
       * Unbound Freedom now grants its caster Blessing of Freedom when cast on
         a different target.
       * Unbound Freedom now prevents Blessing of Freedom from being dispelled
         when cast on the same target.
          * Developers' note: Unbound Freedom is an underperforming talent that
            leans into a Paladin's core strength of enabling their allies. By
            applying the benefit of Blessing of Freedom to the casting Paladin
            as well as their teammate, the spell becomes a powerful tool against
            enemy teams that rely on movement-impairing effects and control.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Retribution
    * Unbound Freedom now grants the Paladin Blessing of Freedom when it is cast
      on another target.
    * Unbound Freedom now prevents Blessing of Freedom from being dispelled when
      cast on the same target.
       * Developers' note: Unbound Freedom is an underperforming talent that
         leans into a Paladin's core strength of enabling their allies. By
         applying the benefit of Blessing of Freedom to the casting Paladin as
         well as their teammate, the spell becomes a powerful tool against enemy
         teams that rely on movement-impairing effects and control.
      
      
   
   
 * Priest
    * Discipline
       * Mana regeneration is now reduced by 40% in PvP (was 45%).
       * Dome of Light reduces the cooldown of Power Word: Barrier by 90 seconds
         (was 60 seconds).
       * Dome of Light reduces damage taken by an additional 25% (was 45%).
       * Premonition now heals up to four friendly targets with your Atonement
         active (was all nearby friendly targets).
       * Premonition's heal radius increased to 40 yards (was 30 yards).
       * Premonition now heals for 55% spell power (was 75% spell power).
       * Premonition now damages you for 35% spell power (was 46% spell power).
       * Premonition increases the duration of your Atonements on targets healed
         by 3 seconds.
       * Trinity now increases the healing transfer of atonement by 20% (was
         12%).
       * Ultimate Radiance increases the healing of Power Word: Radiance by 250%
         (was 200%).
          * Developers' notes: In Season 2, we increased the importance of
            healer mana management in Arenas and Battlegrounds by reducing mana
            regeneration in PvP instances. Due to Discipline's healing style,
            the spec tends to run out of mana much faster in Arena compared to
            other specs. So, we're buffing their mana regeneration in PvP and
            adjusting some of their PvP talents to increase their throughput. In
            addition, we're adjusting Dome of Light to allow it to be used more
            frequently but with less damage reduction to give them an additional
            tool to recover after crowd control.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Shaman
    * Elemental
       * Lightning Lasso now deals 140% spell power per tick (was 8% of the
         target's maximum health).
       * Lightning Lasso now deals damage to permanently stun immune mobs.
      
      
   
   
 * Warlock
    * Affliction
       * Endless Affliction no longer increases the duration of Unstable
         Affliction.
       * Endless Affliction now leaves a 10 second debuff on the target after
         the final Unstable Affliction runs its full duration.
       * Dispelling Endless Affliction will silence, damage, and increase damage
         taken by 10% to the target while active.
       * Casting Unstable Affliction on a target that has Endless Affliction
         active will remove it.
       * A new aura icon will indicate to healers that a target has Endless
         Affliction or Unstable Affliction active.
          * Developers' note: Our intention with the Endless Affliction talent
            is to allow the Warlock to opt into longer dispel protection for
            their team's damage over time spells and other debuffs. The previous
            version of this came at a cost of slowing down the rate at which
            they deal damage. We've broken the additional dispel protection off
            into its own debuff so that this talent doesn't change the warlocks
            damage profile.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * UI
    * The end-of-match scoreboard for Arenas and Battlegrounds now has a new
      look and provides more information about player rewards.
