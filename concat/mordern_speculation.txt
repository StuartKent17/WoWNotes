NEW TRANSMOGRIFICATION COLLECTIONS SYSTEM: APPEARANCES

 * New Collection tab: Appearances
 * Unlock new appearances by collecting Soulbound weapons and armor your character can equip.
 * Unlocked appearances are account-wide and usable for transmogrification by other characters that can equip the item.

 * Transmogrifiers located in most major cities have been improved with additional features.
    * Got a look that you like? Save the entire transmogrification set as an outfit. Create and swap between outfits at the Transmogrifier.

EQUALIZED PVP GEAR

 * Gear has been normalized in PvP combat. Characters entering a Skirmish Arena, Battleground, Rated Arena, Rated Battleground, or Ashran now receive an aura called Principles of War.
 * Principles of War removes all stats gained from gear (Strength, Stamina, Haste, etc.), disables gear related bonuses (like trinket effects and set bonuses), and gives the character stats based on their specializations, and increases based on overall item level. The goal is to provide a much more finely tuned and balanced PvP experience.

ARENAS

 * The pennant attached to the back of characters now changes its appearance based on the player's best rating in the Arena bracket.
 * The 5v5 Arena bracket has been retired. "Arena Master" achievement has been converted into a Feat of Strength.

ITEMS AND ITEMIZATION
ITEMIZATION

    * Spirit and Bonus Armor have been removed.

TALENT SYSTEM CHANGES

 * Players may now change talents freely when in any rested XP area. The Inscription profession can craft consumable items that allow for this to be done in the field. In addition, after queuing into an instanced dungeon, raid, or PvP content, players have a grace period during which they may change talents freely.

GLYPH SYSTEM CHANGES

 * The Glyph panel has been removed from the game. Some minor glyphs that had a cosmetic effect that does not apply to a specific spell have been converted into cosmetic items that provide the same effects as before.
 * Some minor glyphs that made cosmetic alterations to a specific spell have been added to the spell itself in the spellbook.

GNOME HUNTERS

All classes and specializations have undergone changes to abilities and mechanics. Check out our class preview logs for a better understanding on the thought process behind these changes.


See Patch 7.0.3 (class changes) for a list.

PROFESSIONS

NEW CONTENT
NEW KARAZHAN MYTHIC DUNGEON

From the moment of its mysterious creation, the purpose of this dark tower has been intertwined with the history of the Guardians of Tirisfal, once Azeroth's greatest bulwark against the Legion. It is now best known as the home of Medivh, who tragically betrayed Azeroth and brought the unbroken chain of Guardians to an end. This legacy makes Karazhan a place of particular interest for the Legion, who have descended in full force in an effort to open a new front in their war on the denizens of Azeroth.


Gather a party of five seasoned adventurers and return to this legendary dungeon to face eight bosses on Mythic difficulty. It's an experience that may turn you upside-down!

NEW TRIAL OF VALOR RAID

Since Loken's betrayal, Odyn has been trapped within the Halls of Valor as Helya plots in the shadows to claim the souls of his valarjar champions. In recent days, however, great heroes have arrived in the lands of Stormheim in the Legion's wake. Hoping that their might and determination could tip the scales and end Helya's reign, Odyn summons these champions for a final test.


This new three-boss raid dungeon completes the story of Stormheim. Odyn, Guarm, and Helya will become available in Normal and Heroic difficulties two weeks after the launch of Patch 7.1, with Mythic and Raid Finder Difficulties opening afterward.

THE CONTINUING SURAMAR CAMPAIGN

Your heroic efforts in Suramar continue with a series of quests that unlock over a period of nine weeks, ultimately leading you to the very entrance of the Nighthold. Delve into the story of the Nightfallen insurrection against the Nightborne and their Legion allies, and you can obtain the wondrous Arcanist's Manasaber mount. Look for the quest "Lockdown" to get started.

NEW WORLD QUESTS

A new questline that will unlock Helarjar World Quests is now available. Look for “A Call to Action” in Dalaran to discover the depth of Helya's influence on all of the Broken Isles and contribute to the resistance.


Falcosaurs are here! The coastline of the Broken Isles is under assault from an invasive, predatory species, and they're breeding out of control! Falcosaurs drop Falcosaur Eggs and Falcosaur Feathers, reagents for new First Aid and Cooking recipes. Save an Orphaned Falcosaur pet to begin a journey toward understanding these hungry creatures, and you might find yourself with a unique new mount.

ITEMS

 * To allow more options in the gear your character equips, secondary stat ratings (Critical Strike, Haste, Mastery, and Versatility) now contribute less of their respective secondary stat per point. To compensate, the total amount of stats on all items above level 800 has been increased. Additionally, the stats on ring and neck slot items now increase more substantially with item level. As a result, overall performance should remain similar to how it was prior to Patch 7.1.5, but higher item level items will more regularly be an attractive choice when upgrading your gear, especially in the ring and neck slots.
 * New item available for 200 gold from Draemus in Dalaran: [Boon of the Zookeeper]

NEW FEATURES
THE BROKEN SHORE

Return to the Broken Shore and take the fight to the heart of the Legion's power on Azeroth. Begin your journey in a new Scenario, and then lead the Armies of Legionfall against the demonic invasion of Azeroth.


The dynamic ebb and flow of Broken Shore will keep you on your toes as new World Quests, bosses, treasures, and a powerful demon command ship called the Sentinax make for an exciting new experience every day.


Join a region-wide, cross-faction effort to construct buildings that open new content and provide a variety of benefits to help in the fight against the Legion.

NEW DUNGEON: THE CATHEDRAL OF ETERNAL NIGHT

The upper chambers of the Tomb of Sargeras were once a place of worship to Elune. Since the Legion's invasion, fel minions have desecrated this holy place, twisting it into their own image. Now, this site will host a battle that could turn the tide of the invasion. While the Armies of Legionfall engage the fel army directly, a small group of heroes infiltrates the upper reaches of the cathedral in a desperate hope to return the Aegis of Aggramar to its resting place. Inside this new dungeon, you'll face:


 * Agronox - This ancient served the night elves priestesses of the Temple of Elune, tending the beautiful Hanging Gardens. But after the malevolence of the Legion infected the Cathedral, the guardian absorbed fel energy through his roots. Now the twisted Agronox spreads corruption throughout the sanctuary he once protected, believing he has finally achieved his ideal state.
 * Thrashbite the Scornful - Smashspite's detestable brother, Thrashbite has been dispatched to wipe out the mortals entering the cathedral's grand library. The dimwitted mo'arg lacks any respect for knowledge or learning, feeling petty satisfaction as he crashes through ancient artifacts and tramples priceless tomes.
 * Domatrax - With the Aegis of Aggramar socketed back into its cradle, Domatrax leads an onslaught of demons to destroy the relic.
 * Mephistroth - With the forces of Azeroth pushing against his front line, Mephistroth has fallen back to the Cathedral of Eternal Night, where he will employ all his cunning to ensure the heroes fail in securing the Aegis of Agrammar.


This new dungeon is available in Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic Keystone difficulties.

CLASS CAMPAIGNS

After securing a foothold on the Broken Shore and making progress with the Armies of Legionfall, every class continues its own campaign to unify in the war effort. Your Class Hall will be the base from which you will embark on a new quest chain, find a new potential Follower, and discover new class-specific World Quests.


Once your class campaign and the Legionfall campaign on the Broken Shore are complete, all new epic class mounts will become available to those who finish the subsequent class mount quests.

DEMON ASSAULTS

The Burning Legion is preparing to assault Azeroth with renewed determination. After you regain a foothold on the Broken Shore, don't be surprised if [[Broken Isles] zones later come under attack. It will be up to you to fight to drive the Legion back and defend the lands of your new allies.

FLYING IN THE BROKEN ISLES

Take your final steps to complete the [Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two] achievement to unlock flying in the Broken Isles.

LEGION REPUTATION PROGRESS

Reputation earned beyond Exalted will now contribute towards earning additional rewards from Broken Isles faction emissaries. These new reward caches have a rare chance to reward new faction mounts, such as the [Highmountain Elderhorn], [Wild Dreamrunner], and [Leywoven Flying Carpet].

PVP BRAWLS

A series of new twists on popular player-versus-player activities are on the way. Starting with "Southshore vs Tarren Mill", "Gravity Lapse", and "Warsong Scramble", PvP Brawls offer a variety of mode, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay. Look for the Brawl option in the Group Finder (default hotkey: i) Player vs. Player tab, under the Casual selection.

PET BATTLE DUNGEON

Something nefarious is going on in the world of pet battles, and it's worth a closer look. If you have at least one level 25 battle pet, speak to Breanni in Dalaran to get directions to this new scenario.

UPDATED FEATURES
CHARACTER EMPOWERMENT

Your bond with your Artifact has grown stronger, and your Artifact Knowledge has continued to increase. Upon reaching Artifact Knowledge 25, you will receive the quest " [110] Seeking Lost Knowledge", which allows you to unlock further knowledge levels. Additionally, once you have 35 or more traits in your Artifact, the time has come to improve your Artifact even more. Unlock a set of new empowered traits, additional ranks for many of your original traits, and a new final trait by embarking on a new questline.


Your weapon isn't the only thing increasing in power. From dungeon drops to World Quest rewards to items created with your professions, your armor upgrades at higher item levels than before. All the better to fight the Legion!

A new 'Sets' tab in the Appearances UI is where you'll find this new way of tracking item sets from previous Raids, PvP Seasons, and more.

    *  [Thrash] (Bear) direct damage increased by 15%.
    *  [Swipe] (Bear) damage reduced by 25%.
       * Developers' Notes: This should result in overall Guardian damage remaining roughly the same, perhaps slightly higher. But it will frontload their damage more, which should help with burst threat.
      
      
   
   

HUNTER

 * Beast Mastery
    *  [Dire Frenzy] will now additionally cause your pet to charge up to 25 yards toward the target.

       * Developers' note: Previously, casting Reap Souls at 5 stacks (which would grant 25 seconds of the buff) with 20 seconds currently left on the buff would just overwrite your old 20 second buff with a 25 second buff. Now, in this case it will increase the buff duration to 45 seconds.
      
      
    * Souls are now reset to 0 at the start of an encounter. The buff is also canceled at the start of an encounter. Ulthalesh now has a greatly increased chance to generate the first three Tormented Souls at the beginning of a raid encounter.
       * Developers' note: Souls are a resource, and we have a rules about resetting your resources/stacks of a buff before an encounter, so that every attempt is standardized. Having souls the first time you fight a raid boss feels good, but it makes every other attempt after that feel worse by comparison.

    * Developers' notes: The net result of the two Combat Potency and Fortune Strikes changes is that Combat Potency should generate half as much Energy, twice as often.
   
   
 *  [Restless Blades] has returned. Finishing moves reduce the remaining cooldown on [Adrenaline Rush], [Between the Eyes], [Sprint], [Grappling Hook], [Cannonball Barrage], [Killing Spree], [Marked for Death], [Death from Above], [Vanish] by 0.5 seconds per combo point spent.
 *  [Slice and Dice] now increases attack speed by 125% (was 100%).
 *  [Roll the Bones]

    * Buried Treasure increases Energy regeneration by 30% (was 25%).

SUBTLETY

 * Developers' notes: Our overall goals are to remove uncontrolled player teleport from the baseline DPS rotation, to reduce the frequency of teleporting in PvP, to allow players to choose between more frequent or more impactful Shadow Dances, which equates to more frequent CC/utility or damage in PvP, to keep the PvE rotation engaging, and to make [Symbols of Death] more engaging.
 * All damage dealt increased by 20%.
 *  [Backstab] base damage increased by 35%.
 * Backstab damage bonus from being behind the target reduced to 20% (was 30%).

 *  [Marked for Death]'s cooldown reduced to 40 seconds (was 60 seconds) for Subtlety.
    * Developers' notes: This is to balance it against [Premeditation], which is now on the same row. It's a buff in a raid setting, where the talent was very weak.
   
   
 *  [Master of Shadows] now gains 25 Energy over 3 seconds when you enter [Stealth] or [Shadow Dance].
    * Developers' notes: Pooling energy going into a Shadow Dance has long been the way to play Subtlety, and we'd like to bring that back. This design still gives you more energy for a Shadow Dance, but in a way that allows the Rogue to fully utilize pooling gameplay.
   
   
 *  [Nightblade] now increases your damage dealt to the target by 15%, with damage over time component reduced by 35%.
    * Developers' notes: Further pushes Subtlety away from maintaining Nightblade on all secondary targets and instead into focusing their damage into 1 target. Additionally, gives Nightblade a mechanical interaction with the rest of the core rotation that fulfills the "setup" feel of Subtlety.
   
   
 *  [Premeditation] has been removed.
 *  [Relentless Strikes] now causes your finishing moves to generate 6 Energy per combo point spent.
 *  [Second Shuriken] (Artifact trait) damage increased by 200%.

 *  [Shadowstrike] now hits at melee range (was a 15 yard range) and generates 2 combo points (was 1).
 * Shadowstrike, when used while Stealthed, now deals 25% increased damage (was 9%) and teleports you up to 25 yards behind your target. This does not happen while in Shadow Dance or during [Subterfuge].
 *  [Shuriken Combo] is a new passive talent available at level 70: [Shuriken Storm] increases the damage of your next [Eviscerate] by 10% for each enemy hit beyond the first. Stacks up to 5 times.
    * Developers' notes: This aims to remove maintaining Nightblade on every target from your AOE rotation on 4+ targets. Instead, Subtlety will deal increased damage during AOE by focusing it into one target.
   
   
 * Shuriken Storm base damage increased by 67%.
 *  [Sprint] now allows Subtlety Rogues to run over water. This is only possible when running forward.

DESTRUCTION

NEW EVENTS IN TELDRASSIL AND LORDAERON

Beginning the week of July 24 and continuing for three weeks leading to the launch of Battle for Azeroth on August 14, experience the escalation of all-out war in Teldrassil, and later Lordaeron. A new chapter of the relentless conflict at the heart of the Warcraft saga is unfolding, and it's time for you to take your place on the front lines!

NEW CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATIONS

The war with the Burning Legion has left orcs standing tall, a new posture option available to all orc player characters. Blood Elves now have access to golden eyes, as well as a few new faces.


All of these new options are available at Barber Shops throughout Azeroth, and you can now alter your character's skin color while you're there.

PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER

The PvP Honor and Prestige system has been updated. Your PvP progress in Legion has been converted into account-wide Honor levels, which you'll continue to earn through PvP.


All class specializations' PvP Talents have been revamped. Hit default hotkey 'N' to get a look at your PvP Talents, and default hotkey 'H' to see the new PvP system.

WAR MODE IS HERE

You can now enable War Mode and venture out into a world full of others who have made the same dangerous choice. Enabling War Mode provides additional bonuses:


 * All PvP Talents you've chosen will be available to use anywhere PvP can occur.
 * You'll gain an additional bonus to experience while leveling up.
 * Earn additional bonus gold and Resources from World Quests.


War Mode can be toggled on or off beginning at level 20 by visiting either Orgrimmar or Stormwind and setting your preference in the Talent pane (default hotkey 'N'). Beware! Once you venture out in War Mode, all zones will become contested, including zones such as Northshire Abbey.


Sanctuary areas will still be PvP free.


Additional War Mode features such as Bounty Hunter and Air Drops will become available in the new zones of Battle for Azeroth.


July 17, 2018 marks the end of the final Legion season of ranked PvP, and the post-season period has begun. Look for all the new PvP progression and rewards to unlock and become earnable after the launch of Battle for Azeroth in a few weeks.


Strand of the Ancients and Ashran are no longer available.

Voice Chat is now available in all groups, Guilds, and Communities. Select the headset icon wherever you see it in game to talk with other players.

LEGACY LOOT MODE

Now, when you enter an instance at 10 levels or more above the maximum level of the content, Legacy Loot rules will be automatically enabled. Under Legacy Loot rules, drops will include a chance for all items that would drop for a full party or raid at the instance's level.

CLASSES

Sargeras' cruel, final blow dramatically impacted both Azeroth and all of its denizens. The power of every Artifact weapon has now been depleted. Some powers from Artifacts have now been incorporated into their specializations. Your characters that are just getting started in Legion content will still seek out and acquire Artifacts.

STATISTICS

In an effort to make displayed numbers more perceptible, values used for player and enemy statistics have been reduced throughout the game. This includes values such as item-level, damage, armor, health, and defense measurements.


A number of spells and talents now again activate a global cooldown when used.


Blood Elves' [Arcane Torrent] now removes 1 beneficial effect from all nearby enemies and restores 3% of your mana (previously silenced nearby enemies and interrupted non-player characters).

DESCRIPTION
January 22, 2019
For ages untold, Dazar'alor has stood at the center of the great and powerful Zandalari empire. Its guards have thwarted numerous attempts on King Rastakhan's life, and it has endured trials both ancient and new. But as war reaches the shores of Zuldazar, the Alliance embarks on a daring gambit to besiege the golden pyramid and sever the Zandalari's bond to the Horde.

December 10, 2018
The war raging across Azeroth between Alliance and Horde has intensified. As the Alliance lays plans to retake Darkshore and regain a foothold in Kalimdor, both factions have redoubled their attacks across the zones of Kul Tiras and Zandalar.

NEW RAID – BATTLE OF DAZAR'ALOR

The Battle of Dazar'alor is now open. The Alliance is set to stage an attack on the heart of the Zandalari empire in a bid to sever the ties of the Zandalari and the Horde, while Horde players will begin the raid by defending against an invasion in the northern jungle of Zuldazar.


Along the way, players will get to shift to the other faction's perspective and take on three additional bosses. For the first time in a raid, your character will transform into the opposite faction (including their associated racial abilities).


A dozen new, formidable boss encounters, including Lady Jaina Proudmoore and King Rastakhan himself, await you!


 * Mythic difficulty and Raid Finder Wing 1 will open with scheduled weekly maintenance in each region the week of January 29, 2019.
 * Raid Finder Wing 2 will open the week of February 12, 2019, and Raid Finder Wing 3 will open the week of February 26, 2019.

BATTLE FOR AZEROTH SEASON 2

Both the adventures and the war being waged across Azeroth are signified by seasons: times at which many factors and measurements change. Today begins Season 2 of Battle for Azeroth, and you'll find many new challenges and new rewards are now available in Dungeons and PvP content.


 * Dungeons
    * A new season of rewards from dungeons has begun. Complete your best Mythic Keystone each week to earn higher item-level gear, and save up your Titan Residuum to purchase new, powerful Azerite items.
       * Item levels of rewards from level 120 Normal, Heroic, and Mythic dungeons have been increased by 30. Baseline rewards are now item-level 340 from Normal, 355 from Heroic, and 370 from non-Keystone Mythic dungeons.
       * The difficulty of Heroic and Mythic dungeons has been increased by 30%. Normal difficulty dungeons are unchanged.
       * Mythic Keystones have been reduced by an additional 3 levels, to account for this difficulty increase.
       * Mythic Keystone rewards have been increased by 30 item levels. During the first week of Season 2, rewards from end-of-run chests will be capped at item-level 385, and the reward cache contains a Season 1 reward.
       * Beginning the second week of Season 2, the weekly cache will not be affected by the cap, and will reward Season 2 items at the higher item levels.
       * Added a new Tier 3 Mythic Keystone affix: Reaping. This bestows the power of Bwonsamdi on all non-boss creatures in the dungeon, giving them a chance to avenge their own deaths.
       * The Infested affix has been removed.
      
      
   
   


 * Player versus Player
    * Battle for Azeroth PvP Season 2 is now underway. Ranks and ratings have been reset, and you can now begin earning new rewards.
       * Season 2 rewards from PvP sources have been increased by 30 item-levels. This includes [Conquest] rewards and the weekly chest.
       * Players who earn 500 Conquest points in a given week now receive one [Quartermaster's Coin] and an item from that week's selection.
       * Players might also earn an additional piece of gear or Quartermaster's Coin each week by using a weekly bonus roll token in PvP.
       * Quartermaster's Coins can be exchanged for a Warlord's Trophy, which can be used to upgrade a piece of Sinister Gladiator gear to a higher item level.
       * During weeks when the Conquest reward is a head, shoulder, or chest item, players can choose from one of four different pieces of Azerite gear. For the weeks when the Conquest reward is not an Azerite piece, trinket, or weapon, players will be able to choose gear from one of two different slots such as legs and wrists, hands and back, or finger and feet.
       * The PvP reward UI now shows the criteria needed to receive your weekly chest. Elite sets (available to earn for a limited time only) can also be viewed in the Appearances interface on the Sets tab.
       * Players can now work toward earning the [Vicious Black Bonesteed] or [Vicious Black Warsaber]. Once earned, fill the bar again to receive a [Vicious Saddle], which can be used to purchase a mount from previous seasons.
       * The Gladiator title and achievement are can now be earned by winning 50 games in 3v3 Arenas above a 2400 rating. Players in the top 0.1% at the end of Season 2 in this bracket will earn the Sinister Gladiator title.
       * End-of-match rewards will be capped at item-level 385 during the first week of the season, to maintain parity with other endgame systems until Mythic Battle of Dazar'alor becomes available.
      
      
   
   


 * Items and Rewards Updates
    * New epic Azerite gear is now available from Season 2 PvP, the Battle of Dazar'alor raid, World Quest Emissaries, and from the Mythic Keystone vendor Thaumaturge Vashreen in Zuldazar and Boralus. These new items will have a fifth ring with additional new trait options, starting at Heart of Azeroth level 15.
    * The new ring of traits provides two choices of traits per specialization, allowing players the opportunity to find items that have traits they particularly want and the freedom to create new and interesting combinations that may not have been possible before.
    * Further changes to items and rewards include:
       * Azerite Knowledge will increase weekly from January 22 through March 26.
       * The maximum possible item level is now 425 (was 395).
       * Seals of Wartorn Fate have not been changed or reset, and will be used for Battle of Dazar'alor and other Season 2 bonus rolls.
       * Emissary weapon and armor rewards will scale up to item-level 385 (was 370).
       * Loot from Kul Tiras and Zandalar world bosses will remain at item-level 355.
       * Rewards for in-progress emissary quests may reroll or update when Season 2 begins; the quests themselves won't reset or change.
       * The [Titan Residuum] vendor now offers item-level 385, 400, and 415 gear.
       * Titan Residuum is not reset or capped between seasons.
       * Warfronts
          * Darkshore Warfront rewards have been increased by 15 item levels, and the outdoor world boss and the once-per-cycle quest now award item-level 400 gear.
          * The power of all enemies in the Darkshore Warfront have been increased by 15%, and the item level required to queue for Darkshore is now 335 (was 320).
             * Developers' notes: These Darkshore changes will take effect after the current Warfront cycle has ended. If an attack is already underway in your region, the Warfront will give Season 1 rewards until the attack phase ends. This is being done to avoid any unfairness to people who had already completed the Warfront or killed the world boss before the start of the new season.
            
            
          * Rewards from Arathi Basin and Stromgarde Warfront have not changed.

 * Faction Assaults
    * Periodically, the Alliance or the Horde will launch an assault against a hostile position in Kul Tiras or Zandalar. When an Assault is active, a group of new World Quests will be available to both factions in that area. Rally to the location to fight on behalf of your faction and earn new Honorbound or 7th Legion Service Medals that can be exchanged for a variety of rewards.
    * Players who have unlocked World Quests at level 120 on at least one character will have Assault World Quests available to any of their other characters.
   
   

WARFRONT: THE BATTLE FOR DARKSHORE

 * The conflict over the home of the night elves has reached a fever pitch, and new questlines will lead you to the all-new Battle for Darkshore. In this new Warfront, you'll unlock access to powerful hero transformations that give you temporary abilities themed around your role as a tank, healer, or damage dealer.
    * Contributions for Darkshore as well as the Stromgarde Warfront now operate on a daily cycle. When resources are being mustered, three quartermasters will each put out a request for a different contribution each day. The requested turn-ins have also been adjusted to be more consistent in their value.
    * When your faction controls either Arathi Highlands or Darkshore, world quests will now be available in those zones, in place of the once-per-cycle kill quests that were previously offered for Arathi.

    * The chance for cosmetic rewards are now based on all the enemies and Azerite present on the island, and no longer tied to only the enemy camps your team defeats. Completing an Island Expedition at a higher difficulty increases the chance of receiving these bonus rewards.

    * The weekly quest to recover Azerite now requires 36,000 Azerite (was 40,000).

    *  [Tar Trap] will now break an enemy player out of stealth if they are the one to activate the trap.
   
   
 * Priest
    * Discipline
       *  [Premonition] now costs 500 mana (was 0 mana).
      
      
    * Holy
       * Holy Word: Concentration mana cost increased by 20%.
       *  [Ray of Hope] now costs 3000 mana (was 0 mana).
      
      
   
   
 * Warlock
    * Destruction
       *  [Demon Armor] now increases Armor by 150% (was 275%).
          * During Battle for Azeroth Season 1, we identified that Warlocks were taking too much damage from physical sources during PvP. We remedied this by adding a new PvP talent, Demon Armor, which increased their physical mitigation to match characters wearing Plate Armor. As we've been monitoring Season 2, we feel that the armor increase caused Warlocks to become too tanky in the current meta. This change effectively brings their physical mitigation close to that of Mail Armor (about 36% at ilvl 415), when it was previously similar to Plate Armor (about 45% at ilvl 415).
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Warrior
    *  [Sword and Board] now increases critical strike by the correct amount.

NEW ZONE: NAZJATAR

During a high-stakes chase across the seas, the Alliance and the Horde are waylaid by an ancient enemy who's been lurking beneath the depths: Queen Azshara and her fearsome naga army. The naval forces of both factions are destroyed in the ambush, and the survivors find themselves stranded in the ancient naga domain of Nazjatar.


Soon after they arrive in Nazjatar, Alliance heroes will come upon a new faction of deep-sea warriors, the Waveblade Ankoan, while Horde heroes will meet the Unshackled, a group of races who have escaped the naga's clutches. Both sides offer champions who offer their services as combat allies and grow in power over time as players prepare for their epic confrontation with Queen Azshara.


Adventurers who are level 120 and have unlocked Battle for Azeroth World Quests, completing the quest " [120] Uniting Kul Tiras" or " [120] Uniting Zandalar," will receive a summon from either Genn Greymane or Nathanos Blightcaller, kicking off the events that bring them to Nazjatar.

BENTHIC GEAR

Increase your power with Benthic gear, new upgradable armor that can now be collected in Nazjatar. As you explore Nazjatar, you'll collect Prismatic Manapearls—a soulbound currency that can be spent on Benthic tokens and upgrades. These bind-to-account tokens can be used to gain a piece of upgradable Benthic gear specific to your armor type (cloth, leather, mail, plate), starting at item level 385. With enough time and effort, players can dedicate their hard-earned Manapearls to upgrade pieces to ilvl 425, just shy of Heroic-level raid gear (ilvl 430). Harnessing the power of the sea, each piece of Benthic gear boasts a thematic bonus that activates in Nazjatar and the upcoming Azshara's Eternal Palace raid. These bonuses might provide effects that boost your damage, slow down your foes, or even increase your mount speed while adventuring through this perilous region. Put together pieces to create a powerful set for combat, collect a set optimized for exploration, or mix and match to have the best from both worlds.

PRISMATIC MANAPEARLS

Defeating powerful enemies, completing quests, and plundering the treasures of Azshara's minions may yield Prismatic Manapearls, concentrations of magical energy highly prized by Nazjatar's denizens. Spend this new currency on many different items within Nazjatar including Benthic tokens and upgrades for Benthic gear, pets, and a mount. Earn Prismatic Manapearls by completing a variety of activities such as World Quests and daily quests, looting treasure chests, and slaying rare enemies.

NEW ZONE: MECHAGON ISLAND

Legends speak of a place off the craggy coast of Kul Tiras whose denizens have replaced blood and bones with bolts and brass: Mechagon, home of a society of mechanically augmented gnomes and their iron-fisted ruler King Mechagon. Heroes who arrive upon Mechagon's shores will soon meet Prince Erazmin and the Rustbolt Resistance, and after completing a series of new faction-based quests, they'll join their fight to overthrow Erazmin's tyrannical father and put an end to his mad designs.


Players can rise in power and earn the trust of their new allies by participating in new daily quests and other activities unique to Mechagon. These include collaborative Construction Projects that allow players to contribute resources to create a variety of powerful constructs, including experimental weapons, flame turrets, a drill rig that can uncover a cave full of treasures, and more.


After establishing a hub in Nazjatar and empowering their [Heart of Azeroth], players will make their way to Mechagon by starting the quest " [120] The Legend of Mechagon," which can be accepted by Alliance players in Boralus and Horde players in Dazar'alor near each city's respective Flight Masters.

JUNKYARD TINKERING

As they traverse the zone, players will have access to Pascal-K1N6, a giant iron robot who will help players craft equipment, mounts, toys, consumables, and more in exchange for Spare Parts and Energy Cells found across Mechagon. Recipes to craft more items can be found around the island.

POCKET-SIZED COMPUTATION DEVICE

The [Pocket-Sized Computation Device] is a trinket that players can customize via three Punchcard Sockets, into which players can insert one Red, Yellow, and Blue Punch Card. Punch Cards can be collected by questing, exploring the Mechagon zone, and advancing through the new Mythic-only dungeon Operation: Mechagon. Players will receive their Pocket-Sized Computation Device after completing the " [120] Upgraded" quest, available shortly after landing in Mechagon.

NEW RAID: AZSHARA'S ETERNAL PALACE

Battle against Nazjatar's worthiest champions, face down unfathomable monstrosities from the deep, and confront the legendary Queen Azshara herself in this sprawling 8-boss raid.


Learn more about the bosses guarding Azshara's Eternal Palace here.


Azshara's Eternal Palace Normal and Heroic difficulties will open on July 9, two weeks after Rise of Azshara goes live on June 25. Raid Finder Wing One and Mythic will open the following week on July 16.

NEW DUNGEON: OPERATION: MECHAGON

Level 120 players will unite with Prince Erazmin and the Rustbolt Resistance to help overthrow his deranged father and destroy his Mechoriginator doomsday device in this new 8-boss "mega-dungeon." This Mythic-only instance will be open to players after they complete new faction-based quests for the Rustbolt Resistance. Great rewards await you in Mechagon, but bear in mind that gnome-crafted loot might have some surprising properties...


Operation: Mechagon will open to players at the start of Season 3, July 9, after accepting the quest "Operation: Mechagon – The Mechoriginator."

HEART OF AZEROTH SYSTEM UPDATE: ESSENCES

Infuse the might of the Titans into your [Heart of Azeroth] with Essences. These powerful active and passive abilities allow you to customize your playstyle in a whole new way. Each Essence possesses a Major Power (usually a new active ability) and a Minor Power (which is always passive). The Heart of Azeroth has slots for one Major and two Minor Essences. Place an Essence in the Major slot to activate both its Major and Minor Powers, and place up to two in the Minor slots to activate their Minor Powers. Adapt to conquer any situation by applying or swapping them out within rest areas, cities, or when using items such as the Tome of Quiet Mind.


Grow in power each time you unlock one of four ranks for your Essence. At Rank 1, an Essence's Major and Minor effects are available, while Rank 2 and Rank 3 enhance those Major and Minor effects. Rank 4 adds a flashier cosmetic effect to an Essence's Major Power, providing a distinctive appearance that will make its wielder stand out from the crowd. Earn Essences by completing specific activities, including PvP, raiding, or engaging in World Quests. Some Essences are specific to a role (damage dealer, tank, or healer), and some are usable by any role. After acquiring an Essence, you'll be able to hover your mouse over the Essence in the user interface to see information about the next rank and how to acquire it.


Players will need to complete a new quest line to unlock the Heart Forge before infusing Essences into the Heart of Azeroth. This will unlock the Major slot, and will reward them with their first Essence. The two Minor slots will unlock at Heart of Azeroth levels 55 and 65 respectively. Players with a Heart of Azeroth below level 35 will have it raised to level 35 upon unlocking the Heart Forge.


Level 120 players who have established their new hub in Nazjatar will be invited to join Magni at the Chamber of Heart in Silithus to start the new quest line to unlock the Heart Forge, beginning with the quest " [120] Essential Empowerment."

MOUNT EQUIPMENT

Have you ever wished that your favorite mount could carry you across the water without sinking? Give most of your mounts more speed, daze prevention, a parachute, or water walking with mount equipment! Upon reaching level 100 on one character, a new mount equipment slot will become available in the Mounts interface on all characters. Mount equipment can be crafted by Enchanters, Tailors, and Leatherworkers and can be listed in the Auction House or purchased directly from the artisans themselves. Players that already have Water Strider mounts should check their mailbox for one free piece of water-walking mount equipment.


Note that mounts do not benefit from mount equipment in battlegrounds or Arenas and that some do not benefit from mount equipment at all such as the [Sky Golem].

NEW QUESTS

A host of new stories and adventures are now available across Azeroth.

MAGNI BRONZEBEARD

Mysterious magics have awakened across Azeroth. Among them are the essences of the five dragonflights, which Magni Bronzebeard suspects can unlock the full potential of the Heart of Azeroth. Level 120 players should heed Magni's call to continue the story and earn their first Essence, which grants a new, powerful ability tailored to their character's role (damage dealer, healer, or tank) or all roles.

WAR CAMPAIGN: STAY OF EXECUTION

Upon learning of Sylvanas's plans to execute Baine Bloodhoof for treason, the Alliance and the Horde send strike teams to infiltrate the Kor'kron Barracks and rescue the noble tauren chieftain—meeting up with an old orcish ally along the way.


The latest episode of the War Campaign is available to level 120 players who have completed the previous chapters and finished the quest "Clearing out the Cache." Speak to Lady Jaina Proudmoore or Lor'themar in Nazjatar to begin this perilous mission.

NEW HERITAGE ARMOR: GNOMES AND TAUREN

Delve deeper into the lore of the gnomes and the tauren and unlock Heritage Armor that reflects their legacies. Level 120 tauren or gnome players who are Exalted with their faction (Gnomeregan or Thunder Bluff respectively) will be able to embark on a quest line that explores their race's history. Once completed, players will gain a new Heritage Armor transmogrification set usable by all their characters of the same race.


Eligible gnomes and tauren can begin the quest by speaking with their race's ambassador in their faction's Embassy in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. Those seeking the tauren Heritage Armor will additionally to be tasked with freeing Baine in the War Campaign quest " [120] Stay of Execution" (on any character on their account) before beginning their quest line.

NEW EPIC BATTLEGROUND: ASHRAN

Once home to a mighty ogre empire, the ruins of Ashran hold ancient artifacts infused with great power that could turn the tide of war. Return to Draenor and fight on familiar turf in a brand-new 40v40 Epic Battleground: Ashran.


Starting at level 100, players can clash with the enemy faction on the main road of Ashran, carving a warpath into the enemy's stronghold. After either slaying 700 enemy reinforcements or successfully invading the stronghold, players will come together to bring down the enemy faction leader—the Alliance's Grand Marshal Tremblade or the Horde's High Warlord Volrath. Collect Ancient Artifacts, Artifact Fragments, Class Spellbooks, and other items to improve your chances of victory. Gathering Artifact Fragments from fallen foes will allow you to summon elite allies, Fangraal and Kronus, to lead your faction's charge into battle.


Players will find and be able to queue for Ashran in the Epic Battleground section of the Group Finder (default hotkey: i).

NEW ISLAND EXPEDITIONS

Set sail and discover two new Islands: Crestfall and Snowblossom Village. New loot including armor, weapons, and pets awaits players, but beware: you're not alone. Faction rivals will want to hoard the spoils for themselves. Take them down!

NEW MISSIONS AND MECHANICS

FLYING IN KUL TIRAS AND ZANDALAR

The once-forbidden skies of Kul Tiras and Zandalar will soon be open to heroes eager to take flight. The achievement [Battle for Azeroth Pathfinder, Part Two] will allow daring adventurers to take to the skies in Battle for Azeroth's zones, including in the new ones, Mechagon and Nazjatar. Hardy adventurers will need to earn Revered reputation with the Rustbolt Resistance and with their new Nazjatar allies (The Waveblade Ankoan or The Unshackled), explore Mechagon and Nazjatar, and complete the first part of the meta-achievement, [Battle for Azeroth Pathfinder, Part One].


Adventurers who complete these requirements and unlock flying will also be rewarded with a mechanical parrot mount: Wonderwing 2.0.

MOUNTS

 [CRIMSON TIDESTALLION]

These blood-red, spirited creatures gracefully flit through the water, carrying heroes swiftly through the sea. Crimson Tidestallions can be purchased from Murloc Trader Mrrl in Nazjatar in exchange for several eclectic items after completing the quest "A Safer Place."

ROYAL SNAPDRAGON

Fierce and loyal companions, blue Royal Snapdragons are snatched from the wild at a young age and raised to serve naga hunters. Claim your own by vanquishing high-ranking naga in Nazjatar.

X-995 MECHANOCAT

Crafted through Junkyard Tinkering, these robotic cats can be painted a variety of colors, which players can collect during their adventures in Mechagon.

(have one level-25 pet) for Normal difficulty or Pro Pet Group (have 15 level-25 pets) for Challenge difficulty. Seek out Tizzy Gearjolt in Boralus or Radek Fuselock in Dazar'alor to get started.

BRAWLER'S GUILD

 * The Strange Thing encounter is now easier to defeat.

CLASSES

 * Death Knight
    * Frost
       *  [Runic Empowerment] has a 2% chance to proc per Runic Power spent (was 1.5%).
       *  [Icecap] now reduces [Pillar of Frost] cooldown by 2 seconds (was 1 second).
       *  [Frost Fever]'s chance to generate Runic Power increased to 30%.
          * Chance now diminishes on targets beyond the first.
         
         
       *  [Frost Strike] damage increased by 15%.
       *  [Breath of Sindragosa] damage reduced by 10%.
       * Breath of Sindragosa now generates 2 Runes when cast, and another 2 when the effect expires.
       * Breath of Sindragosa costs 16 Runic Power per second (up from 15).
          * Developers' notes: Frost was starved of resources too often, especially when using Breath of Sindragosa. This increases Frosts' Rune income baseline and includes a further change that returns many extra Runes while using Breath of Sindragosa. Breath builds will now be able to fill more global cooldowns with casts of [Obliterate] to make up for the lost Frost Strikes. The cost of Breath itself is increased to keep its overall duration roughly unchanged.
         
         
      
      
    * Unholy
       *  [Festering Strike], [Scourge Strike], [Festering Wound], [Death Coil], and [Clawing Shadows] damage increased by 15%.
       *  [Army of the Dead]'s Ghoul damage increased by 6%.
          * Developers' notes: Previously, a bug allowed Army of the Dead Ghouls' Energy to benefit doubly from Haste. To compensate for the effects of the bug fix, we've increased their damage to keep it consistent.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Demon Hunter
    * Havoc
       *  [Mastery: Demonic Presence] damage bonus increased by 20%.
       *  [Chaos Strike] and Trail of Ruin damage reduced by 4%.
          * Developer's notes: Previously Mastery was relatively weak when compared to other secondary stats. By increasing Mastery's effect for Havoc, it should now be a more desirable stat on gear. To balance this upcoming power increase, we've slightly reduced the damage output of Chaos Strike and Trial of Ruin.
         
         
      
      
    * Vengeance
       *  [Demonic Wards] damage reduction increased to 15% (was 10%).
       * Demonic Wards armor bonus increased to 100% (was 80%).
       *  [Demon Spikes] armor reduced to 60% of Agility (was 85%).
       *  [Soul Cleave] damage increased by 40%.
          * Developers' notes: More so than other tanks, Vengeance Demon Hunters are currently dealing with the problem of low mitigation when their active mitigation is down. These changes provide a substantial increase to physical mitigation when Demon Spikes is down, and a neutral-to-very-slight increase when Demon Spikes is active. The changes also provide some overall passive reduction to magic damage. Overall, the amount of sustained damage Vengeance takes will be lower, and the periods of vulnerability outside of Demon Spikes should be less dramatic.
         
         
      
      
    * Metamorphosis
       * Health bonus is now 50% (was 30%).
       *  [Shear] now generates 20 additional Pain and 1 additional Lesser Soul Fragment (was: generates 7 Pain per second).
          * Developers' notes: This significantly increases the health bonus, damage mitigation, and self-healing potential of Metamorphosis, as well as the health buffer, making it a more reliable major cooldown against all types of damage.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Druid
    *  [Soothe], [Remove Corruption], [Moonfire], and [Rebirth] are no longer castable in Cat or [Bear Form] by default.
    * Feral Druids now have a passive ability learned at level 22 that allows Remove Corruption and Soothe to be cast in Cat Form.
    * Guardian Druids now have a passive ability learned at level 10 that allows Soothe, Remove Corruption, Moonfire, and Rebirth to be cast in Bear Form.
       * Developers' notes: Guardian Druid is limited in its practical ability to use some utility abilities while tanking, and we're loosening that restriction by allowing Remove Corruption in Bear Form. We're also cleaning up Druid shapeshifting rules slightly: the use of magical-themed spells in beast forms is allowed by passive upgrades given to Guardian and Feral specializations specifically. This represents their special mastery of their "home" form that allows for limited spellcasting, and from a gameplay perspective, this allows Feral and Guardian Druids to use spells in-form when there is a strong practical need. At the same time, in situations where there is no fantasy justification or gameplay need, it makes sense for spellcasting to be more restricted. For example, non–Guardian Druids can no longer cast Moonfire in Bear Form.
      
      
    * Guardian
       *  [Ironfur] now has a maximum of 8 stacks.
       * Ironfur and [Maul] now cost 40 Rage (was 45).
       *  [Mangle] now generates 10 Rage (was 8).
          * Developers' notes: Ironfur is intended to be maintainable with high uptime (up to 100%) and have some overlaps on top of that. Currently, depending on talent configuration, Druids may only be able to barely maintain full uptime on Ironfur. Making Ironfur much more available should allow better control over timing and overlaps, as well as improving Guardian mitigation overall.
         
         
       * Shifting to [Bear Form] now gives 25 Rage (was 20).
          * Developers' notes: It should now be much easier to get the first Ironfur activated promptly after engaging an enemy, due to the increased starting Rage and lower cost.
         
         
       * Mangle and [Thrash] direct damage increased by 15%.
       *  [Frenzied Regeneration] (Rank 3) is learned at level 85.
       * Frenzied Regeneration's healing has been increased by 33%.
      
      
    * Restoration
       * Casting [Overgrowth] while [Soul of the Forest] is active will now increase the healing of Overgrowth's [Rejuvenation], instead of its [Regrowth] heal over time effect.
      
      
   
   
 * Hunter
    * Horridon is now tamable by Hunters of any specialization.
    * Beast Mastery
       * Barbed Shot damage is now affected by [Bestial Wrath].
       * Barbed Shot damage reduced by 10%.
       * Oondasta is now tamable by Beast Mastery Hunters.
          * Developers' notes: We are fixing a bug that caused Bestial Wrath to not affect Barbed Shot damage, and lowering the base damage of Barbed Shot to keep overall damage roughly unchanged.
         
         
      
      
    * Survival
       * Mastery: Spirit Bond damage bonus increased by 20%.
          * Developers' notes: Previously Mastery was relatively weak when compared to other secondary stats. By increasing the power of Mastery's effect for Survival, it should now be a more desirable stat on gear.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Mage
    * Frost
       *  [Mastery: Icicles] damage bonus increased by 15%.
       *  [Glacial Spike] base damage reduced by 7%.
          * Developers' notes: Previously Mastery was relatively weak when compared to other secondary stats. By increasing Mastery's effect for Frost, it should now be a more desirable stat on gear. To balance this upcoming power increase, we've slightly reduced the damage output of Glacial Spike.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Priest
    * Shadow
       *  [Auspicious Spirits] now increases Shadowy Apparition damage by 50%.
       *  [Shadow Word: Pain] damage reduced by 9%.
       *  [Vampiric Touch] damage reduced by 9%.
          * We believe damage-over-time specializations that maintain a variety of DoT spells should in general output more damage in encounters with multiple targets than single-target oriented specializations. In addition to measuring class specializations against others, we must also balance them across the entire spectrum of content. Due to the types of encounters in Tides of Vengeance, Shadow Priests were especially strong in some contexts and correspondingly weak in very few situations when compared to similar DoT specializations. As such, we're slightly pulling back on the abilities that proc Shadowy Apparition, which is the prominent contributor of making Shadow Priests significantly stronger than similar counterparts.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Rogue
    * Outlaw
       * Keep Your Wits About You (Azerite Trait) now stacks once per instance of [Blade Flurry] dealing damage (was once for every target Blade Flurry hits). Each stack now provides 5% [Sinister Strike] chance (was 2%).
          * Developers' notes: In very large packs of enemies, especially in dungeons, Keep Your Wits About You provides much more damage than one copy of one Azerite Trait was intended to provide. With this change, you'll still feel this trait accelerate as you build stacks, but the size of the group that you're fighting won't affect how much damage the trait is giving you. This will be a damage increase against two targets, and a damage reduction against 3 or more targets.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Shaman
    * Enhancement
       * The Molten Weapon buff from the Elemental Spirits talent now only modifies the Fire damage of your class abilities, instead of modifying all Fire damage dealt.
          * Developers' notes: With the addition of the new Azerite Essences in the Rise of Azshara content update, many of which deal Fire damage, we did not want to make this talent feel mandatory. Prior to this change, the Molten Weapon buff from the fiery Spirit Wolf would have increased the damage dealt by several Azerite Essences. The buff effects from Elemental Spirits talent are intended to increase your class abilities, and still will after this change.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Warrior
    * Arms
       *  [Execute], [Mortal Strike], [Rend], and [Slam] damage increased by 6%.
       *  [Mastery: Deep Wounds] damage bonus increased by 12%.
          * Developers' notes: Previously Mastery was relatively weak when compared to other secondary stats. By increasing the power of Mastery's effect for Arms, it should now be a more desirable stat on gear.
         
         
      
      
    * Protection
       * Unstoppable Force [Thunder Clap] damage reduced to 30% (was 100%).
          * Developers' notes: Protection Warrior burst DPS with Avatar is extremely high for a tank. This talent was adding more damage than necessary, given that it also decreases Thunder Clap's cooldown and synergizes well with certain Azerite traits.
         
         
      
      
   
   

DUNGEONS AND RAIDS
ARTIFACT POWER

Several Mythic Keystone dungeons now award different amounts of Artifact Power based on their length.


 * Siege of Boralus, Temple of Sethraliss, The Motherlode!!, Tol Dagor, and Waycrest Manor AP rewards have increased by 30%.

MYTHIC KEYSTONE DUNGEON UPDATES

 * Freehold
    * Reduced dungeon completion timer to 33 minutes (was 36 minutes).
   
   
 * King's Rest
    * Enemy Forces requirements increased by 10%.
    * Increased the Enemy Forces contribution of Animated Guardian.
   
   
 * Shrine of the Storm
    * Enemy Forces requirements increased by 5%.
    * Increased the Enemy Forces contribution granted by eliminating several non-boss enemies (Deepsea Ritualist, Windspeaker Heldis, Runecarver Skorn, Guardian Elemental, Living Current, Abyssal Eel).
   
   
 * Tol Dagor
    * Enemy Forces requirements increased by 15%.
    * Heavy Cannons now start with 100 Energy and Canon Blast costs 20 energy.
   
   
 * Waycrest Manor
    * Enemy Forces requirements increased by 5%.
    * Increased the Enemy Forces contribution of Matron Alma.
   
   

HELLFIRE CITADEL

    * The damage that Hellfire Reinforcements and Felfire-Imbued Siege Vehicles inflict to the Hellfire Cannons has been massively reduced for characters with a level of 104 or greater on all raid difficulties.
    * The number of Felfire Munitions required to defeat the encounter has been reduced to 5 for characters with a level of 104 or greater on all raid difficulties.
   
   

ISLAND EXPEDITIONS UPDATES

 * Some powerful consumable items such as the Demolisher and Siege Engine have returned to PvP Island Expeditions. These items can now be collected, repaired, and fought over throughout the island.
 * The rotating Seafarer's Dubloon vendors who previously sold these consumables now have new items to offer.

ITEMS AND REWARDS

 * Artifact Power
    * Azerite values have been adjusted to allow players to get more of their total Artifact Power from the below sources.
       * Dungeons
          * Mythic Keystone Dungeon Weekly Cache now rewards 3800 AP (was 1900).
         
         
       * Island Expeditions
          * Heroic Island End-of-match now rewards 300 AP (was 225 AP).
          * Mythic and PvP Island End-of-match now rewards 450 AP (was 350 AP).
          * Island Weekly Quest now rewards 3500 AP (was 2500 AP).
         
         
       * Player versus Player
          * First Win of the Day Bonus now rewards 100% more AP.
          * 2v2 Arena now rewards 240 AP (was 120 AP).
          * 3v3 Arena now rewards 300 AP (was 150 AP).
          * Unrated Battlegrounds now rewards 300 AP (was 150 AP).
          * Epic Battlegrounds now rewards 600 AP (was 300 AP).
          * Rated Battlegrounds now rewards 1050 AP (was 525 AP).
          * Against Overwhelming Odds now rewards 2000 AP (was 1000 AP).
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Gear Scaling
    * Most item effects that deal damage or healing now scale based off of a character's secondary stat (was primary stat).
       * Developers' note: We made some under-the-hood changes to how item effects that deal damage, healing, and shielding scale with item level. The net effect of these changes is that almost all items like this in Battle for Azeroth are now moderately stronger. The difference is greater the higher the item level of the item. This includes items from Battle for Azeroth dungeons, raids, and PvP rewards.
      
      
   
   
 * Heart of Azeroth
    * The Personal Absorb-O-Tron Azerite Trait will now absorb 50% of damage taken over 20 seconds (was 100%). The total amount of damage absorbed by this trait remains unchanged.
    * Paladin
       * Holy
          * Developers' note: This build has gotten far enough ahead of other Holy Paladin options, as well as other healers in some cases, that we're paring it back while leaving the gameplay generally unchanged.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Players in Nazjatar can now ride underwater mounts on land with Budding Deepcoral.
 * A Tiny Clockwork Key allows Pepe to sometimes dress up as mechanical bird.
 * Some heirlooms have been renamed to be more faction-specific.
    * Bolstering War Horn has been renamed to Dwarven War Horn (Alliance) and Orcish War Horn (Horde).
    * Bolstering War Horn has been renamed to Dwarven War Horn (Alliance) and Orcish War Horn (Horde).
    * Cloak of Hardened Steel has been renamed to Banded Gilnean Cloak (Alliance) and Stone Guard's Bladed Cloak (Horde).
    * Dusk Powder has been renamed to Kaldorei Powder of Twilight (Alliance) and Deathstalker's Gloaming Powder (Horde).
    * Enchanted Scroll has been renamed to Tidesage's Warscroll (Alliance) and Loa-Touched Warscroll (Horde).
   
   

LEVELING

 * Players who manually group with a player that has turned off experience gains will now receive 95% less experience.
    * Developers' note: This change does not impact players who find themselves automatically grouped by matchmaking for activities like Group Finder dungeons or Island Expeditions.
   
   

PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER

 * Arena
    * Tiger's Peak has finished repairs and is once again available as an Arena map.
    * Team colors have been changed from gold and green to gold and purple.
   
   
 * Battlegrounds
    * Alterac Valley
       * UI now tracks progress for summoning Lokholar the Ice Lord and Ivus the Forest Lord.
       * Two seasonal quests have been added to Alterac Valley. These quests, similar to the ones offered in Wintergrasp, will reset and are repeatable each season.
      
      
    * Seething Shore
       * When the battleground begins, the same three nodes will always be in the first wave (Ridge, Ruins, and Tar Pits).
       * Players who use the jetpack's Thrust ability while airborne now travel further.
      
      
   
   
 * Enlistment Bonus
    * Now rewards 50% more Azerite Power for participating in Random Battlegrounds and Epic Battlegrounds.
       * Developers' note: Battleground queue times become exceedingly long when one faction has more people queuing than the other. When queue times exceed a certain threshold, Mercenary Mode becomes available for the faction with long queue times and the Enlistment Bonus becomes available for the less represented faction. Now, the Enlistment Bonus will increase the amount of Azerite Power from Random Battlegrounds and Random Epic Battlegrounds by 50%.
      
      
   
   
 * Items
    * Void Stone's absorption ability has been reduced by 30% for healers and 60% for non-healers in PvP.
    * Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism personal absorption shield has been reduced by 30% for tank specializations and 60% for non-tank specializations in PvP.
    * Abyssal Speaker's Gauntlets absorption shield is now reduced by 80% in PvP (was 66%).
    * Trident of the Deep Ocean absorption shield is now reduced by 75% in PvP (was 50%).
    * Mindthief's Eldritch Clasp healing and self-damage effect is now reduced by 50% in PvP.
       * Developers' note: Several Crucible of Storms raid items had a significant impact on the PvP meta in Season 2. We believe that raid items in PvP can be a meaningful source of gameplay variety that contribute to each season feeling a bit different than ones before it. Due to the nature of our PvP scaling system, which helps make PvP more accessible for more players, means the effects of these items will remain relevant longer than we'd like. Therefore, we're reducing the effectiveness of these items in the new patch so players can feel good about transitioning to new items they acquire in Season 3.
      
      
    * Horde and Alliance Glider Kits now have a prideful new look.
    * All racial abilities that share a cooldown with Honorable Medallion now only display corresponding information when the talent is selected.
   
   
 * Death Knight
    * Frost
       * Chill Streak no longer deals damage based on the target's (or caster's) maximum health.
       * Chill Streak now deals an additional percent of Attack Power per bounce to applicable targets (up to 9%).
       * Chill Streak no longer adheres to the maximum health percentage PvP talent restrictions.
       * Chill Streak can now critical strike, scale with your increased damage modifications (e.g. Mastery), and benefit from damage taken debuffs applied on the target.
          * Developers' note: We're changing Chill Streak from damage based on the target's maximum health to one based on the Death Knight's attack power. This has the effect of dealing damage more equally against targets of any health range.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Druid
    * Restoration
       * Casting Overgrowth while Soul of the Forest is active will now increase the healing of Overgrowth's Rejuvenation, instead of its Regrowth heal over time effect.
          * Developers' notes: Overgrowth applies both Rejuvenation and Regrowth's heal over time effect, but Soul of the Forest will only effect one of them. We're adjust the interaction of these two spells to more accurately match players expectations of their synergy.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Monk
    * Brewmaster
       * Hot Trub now splits its damage among all enemies hit.
      
      
   
   
 * Paladin
    * Protection
       * Unbound Freedom now grants its caster Blessing of Freedom when cast on a different target.
       * Unbound Freedom now prevents Blessing of Freedom from being dispelled when cast on the same target.
          * Developers' note: Unbound Freedom is an underperforming talent that leans into a Paladin's core strength of enabling their allies. By applying the benefit of Blessing of Freedom to the casting Paladin as well as their teammate, the spell becomes a powerful tool against enemy teams that rely on movement-impairing effects and control.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Retribution
    * Unbound Freedom now grants the Paladin Blessing of Freedom when it is cast on another target.
    * Unbound Freedom now prevents Blessing of Freedom from being dispelled when cast on the same target.
       * Developers' note: Unbound Freedom is an underperforming talent that leans into a Paladin's core strength of enabling their allies. By applying the benefit of Blessing of Freedom to the casting Paladin as well as their teammate, the spell becomes a powerful tool against enemy teams that rely on movement-impairing effects and control.
      
      
   
   
 * Priest
    * Discipline
       * Mana regeneration is now reduced by 40% in PvP (was 45%).
       * Dome of Light reduces the cooldown of Power Word: Barrier by 90 seconds (was 60 seconds).
       * Dome of Light reduces damage taken by an additional 25% (was 45%).
       * Premonition now heals up to four friendly targets with your Atonement active (was all nearby friendly targets).
       * Premonition's heal radius increased to 40 yards (was 30 yards).
       * Premonition now heals for 55% spell power (was 75% spell power).
       * Premonition now damages you for 35% spell power (was 46% spell power).
       * Premonition increases the duration of your Atonements on targets healed by 3 seconds.
       * Trinity now increases the healing transfer of atonement by 20% (was 12%).
       * Ultimate Radiance increases the healing of Power Word: Radiance by 250% (was 200%).
          * Developers' notes: In Season 2, we increased the importance of healer mana management in Arenas and Battlegrounds by reducing mana regeneration in PvP instances. Due to Discipline's healing style, the spec tends to run out of mana much faster in Arena compared to other specs. So, we're buffing their mana regeneration in PvP and adjusting some of their PvP talents to increase their throughput. In addition, we're adjusting Dome of Light to allow it to be used more frequently but with less damage reduction to give them an additional tool to recover after crowd control.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Shaman
    * Elemental
       * Lightning Lasso now deals 140% spell power per tick (was 8% of the target's maximum health).
       * Lightning Lasso now deals damage to permanently stun immune mobs.
      
      
   
   
 * Warlock
    * Affliction
       * Endless Affliction no longer increases the duration of Unstable Affliction.
       * Endless Affliction now leaves a 10 second debuff on the target after the final Unstable Affliction runs its full duration.
       * Dispelling Endless Affliction will silence, damage, and increase damage taken by 10% to the target while active.
       * Casting Unstable Affliction on a target that has Endless Affliction active will remove it.
       * A new aura icon will indicate to healers that a target has Endless Affliction or Unstable Affliction active.
          * Developers' note: Our intention with the Endless Affliction talent is to allow the Warlock to opt into longer dispel protection for their team's damage over time spells and other debuffs. The previous version of this came at a cost of slowing down the rate at which they deal damage. We've broken the additional dispel protection off into its own debuff so that this talent doesn't change the warlocks damage profile.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * UI
    * The end-of-match scoreboard for Arenas and Battlegrounds now has a new look and provides more information about player rewards.
