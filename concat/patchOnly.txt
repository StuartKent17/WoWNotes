 *  MAPS INTRODUCED
   
    * Tanaris Instance
   
   


 *  MAJOR CHANGES
   HIGH END LOCATIONS ADDED
   
   Two new high-level instance dungeons - Stratholme and Blackrock Spire - and three exterior zones - Winterspring, Western Plaguelands, and Eastern Plaguelands - have been introduced to Azeroth.
   
   
    * Stratholme is geared toward level 55-60 players and is located in the northern part of Eastern Plaguelands.
    * Blackrock Spire is a 53-60 dungeon located within Blackrock Mountain that lies between Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes. Roughly 80% of the dungeon is tuned for a single group of level 55-60 players. The top 20% of the dungeon is tuned for a very "uber" group of five, or more likely 10, level 60 players.
    * Winterspring is exterior level 55-60 zone to the East/Northeast of Felwood through Timbermaw Hold. The goblin city of Everlook is located in Winterspring.
    * Western and Eastern Plaguelands have also been added. The city of Andorhal, the origin of the plague is located in Western Plaguelands.
    * Quests and monsters are near completion for Winterspring and Western Plaguelands. Eastern Plaguelands is still undergoing further work.
   
   RAID GROUPS
   
   Raid group functionality is now available. Raid groups will be able to fight together in instance dungeons and work together to accomplish tasks too difficult for five member groups. Once a group reaches five members, it can be converted into a raid group. Raid groups can support up to 40 members and can be accessed by opening the Raid group tab in the Social window. Not all raid group functionality is complete. However, we encourage our players to try it out and give us feedback on the new feature through the /suggest function.
   
   THE DEEPRUN TRAM OPENS!
   
   The Gnomish Engineering Corps has been hard at work building a subway to connect the great cities of Ironforge and Stormwind City. Final work on this new mass transit system was completed recently, allowing us to announce the Grand Opening of the Deeprun Tram! Two trains make round trip runs between Stormwind City and Ironforge regularly, allowing quick and easy access to all your shopping and training needs. If you happen to miss a train, you only need to wait a few minutes for a new one to appear. We only ask that you be careful during your trip as the run out of the tunnel can be long and uneventful should you happen to fall off the tram during transit.
   
   TRADE SKILLS BECOME PROFESSIONS
   
   Most trade skills are being renamed to "professions," and the way in which players acquire and learn them is changing. You will no longer learn different professions by paying for them with skill points. You'll still learn them by speaking to the appropriate profession trainer. However, players will now be restricted to learning two professions. We decided to change the skill system to make it simpler, balanced, and more intuitive. The new system should allow everyone to participate in one to two professions, and create a much more vibrant market for goods generated from professions. The professions are: alchemy, blacksmithing, enchanting, engineering, herbalism, mining, leatherworking, skinning, and tailoring. Several old trade skills are being turned into secondary skills. These do not count toward your two-profession limit, so players can learn all three secondary skills, in addition to their two professions, without restriction. The survival skill is being removed and campfires have been folded into the cooking profession. The secondary skills are: cooking, fishing, and first aid.
   
   NO MORE SKILL POINTS
   
   With the changes to trade skills, skill points (SP) will be removed from the game, and currency will be used instead to train skills formerly based on SP. Mount trainers will now require you to have a certain level of reputation with their respective city in order to acquire a mount. Characters that had trained in more than two professions have had excess professions randomly removed to meet the two profession restriction.
   
   LEVEL CAP RAISED
   
   The level cap has been increased to 60. Some new zones, quests, items, and content have been added to accommodate the level increase.
   
   TALENT SYSTEM
   
    * Druid and Shaman talents are now available. Druids and Shamans can now utilize the talent interface by pressing the "Talents" button next to the "Spellbook and Abilities" button, or by pressing the "N" default hotkey. Talents become available (to classes that currently have talents) to players starting at level 10.
    * A substantial number of talents have been modified in a variety of ways: 
       * Certain talents have had their potency increased or decreased.
       * Locations of talents in the talent trees have changed.
       * Functionality of certain talents has been modified.
       * New talents have been added to some of the existing talent trees.
      
      
   
   OTHER CHANGES
   PROFESSIONS:
   
    * The level requirements for the Gnome and Goblin engineering quests have been adjusted downward.
    * Blacksmithing recipes added up to skill 300. There are no recipes on the trainer past skill 250. You need to do quests or find drops to get those recipes.
    * Additional blacksmithing specializations added. Weaponsmiths can become Swordsmiths, Axesmiths, or Hammersmiths.
    * Players who already have either blacksmithing specialization, weaponsmith or armorsmith, will continue to be able to make those recipes that they already know. However, to learn further recipes in those specializations, they will need to complete the weaponsmith or armorsmith quest, respectively.
    * Time required to make high-end profession items significantly reduced
    * Essences, dusts and shards have had their vendor sell price set to zero.
    * Bandaging operates differently than it used to. Bandages now are channel cast and heal over time. If the player bandaging or the player being bandaged is struck in combat, the bandaging effect ends. Either way the target still gets the "recently bandaged" debuff.
    * Enchanters can now enchant leather and thorium (needed for some high-end blacksmithing recipes and soon other high-end recipes in other professions).
    * Alchemists can now transmute thorium and arcane crystals into arcanite. This is the only way to acquire this rare material.
    * Stats on a number of tailored items have been improved
    * A number of new higher level cooking recipes added
    * Merchant purchase/sale price of herbs significantly increased
    * Alchemist's Stone has become Philosophers' Stone.

    * Stoneshield potion significantly improved.

    * Stats on the Smoking Heart of the Mountain changed
    * Spears cannot be enchanted with 2H Weapon-only enchantments
    * Fist Weapons can now be enchanted (bug fixed).
    * Mithril Shield Spike damage slightly reduced, Thorium Shield Spike (more powerful crafted item) added
    * The Gnomish engineering Net-o-Matic will now fail more often and in a new way as well.
    * A number of engineering items had tools/anvil required to create them (fixing bugs)
    * Scorpid Scale drops for leatherworking increased (Drop rate doubled)
    * Wastewanders in Tanaris now have a much higher chance of dropping the Scorpid Leather recipes.
    * A number of new uncommon weapons/armors have been added to vendors around the world
    * New daggers have been added to blacksmithing
    * Dreamless Sleep potion added to alchemy
    * Reagents required for some alchemy potions changed.
    * Reagents for some blacksmithing items changed.
    * Old enchanting reagents removed from vendors (they should have been removed last push).
    * Gemology has been removed (with hopes it will make a return someday).
   
   FACTIONS AND REPUTATION:
   
    * The Horde and Alliance are each considered a team, and the four races comprising each team are considered factions. The four starting racial factions for each team should be displayed under the appropriate team's header.
    * Factions are now displayed with appropriate headers in the Reputation UI. Factions that do not fall into the category of a team are labeled as "Other."
    * The factions of the opposing team are always at the lowest reputation level of Hated, and are always locked in the "At War" state.
    * Players have a bonus to their starting reputation with their own race's faction.
    * Forsaken players have lower-than-normal starting reputation with their team's Troll, Tauren, and Orc factions.
    * Troll, Tauren, and Orc players have lower than normal starting reputation with their team's Forsaken faction.
    * You cannot declare war on any of your own team's factions.
   
   AUCTION HOUSES:
   
    * The layouts of the Orgrimmar and Ironforge auction houses have changed slightly.
    * The auction house in Booty Bay has been moved to Gadgetzan.
   
   QUESTS:
   
    * Range weapons have been added as quest rewards for newbie zones that Hunters can start out in.
    * Several new blacksmithing quests have been added.
    * The quest [28] Death From Below in Arathi Highlands was temporarily disabled.
    * Several new epic item quests have been added.
    * Dungeon quest rewards have been revamped. Quests that involve the more difficult encounters of a given dungeon have had their rewards boosted.

    * Lowered the cost of improving the [Brilliant Gold Ring] in the " [34D] Return of the Ring" quest series. The improved ring should also now be strictly better than the Brilliant Gold Ring.
    * Removed the random spawn location of Scrimshank's surveying gear in " [48] The Scrimshank Redemption."
    * Players should no longer receive the option to take part once more in the " [Essence of Eranikus]" quest line once they have started on it.
    * Cenarion Circle Caches no longer give a coin award.
    * Evergreen Pouches, not Packets of Tharlendris Seeds, are now the device used to make [Morrowgrain]. Using a pouch creates an [Evergreen Herb Casing], which when opened reveals what herb is made.
    * Evergreen Pouches now require that you have a Packet of Tharlendris Seeds and two Un'Goro Soil samples to use.
    * Evergreen Pouches have a cooldown time of 10 minutes on usage.
    * The potential herbs drawn from a Sealed Evergreen Pouch have been modified to include a broader range of herbs. As a result, players will not be getting high-end herbs as often on pouch usages.
    * Scalding Mornbrew is now removed from the inventory five minutes after receiving it.
    * Two new Warlock class quest series added for players in their mid 30s ending with two very nice items.
   
   ZONES:
   
    * The Barrens has had more rework done on their quests to make the area more player-friendly and to elaborate on the story behind the area.
    * Thousand Needles has had more quests and zone rework done. Horde players should find this a much healthier alternative to Hillsbrad Foothills to explore and do more quests.
    * Desolace has also had a facelift and should be getting more quests soon.
    * Two new crypts have been added to Ravenhill Cemetery.
    * Ironbeard's Tomb in Wetlands is now a one room, Dwarven-built mausoleum.
    * More quests added to Felwood and Darkshore.

    * Alliance Boat from Menethil to Theramore and back
    * Alliance Boat from Menethil to Auberdine and back
    * Alliance Boat from Rut'theran Village at the base of Teldrassil to Auberdine
   
   
   Because of these changes, players now do not start with any flight node other than their starting city. On the Alliance side, Night Elves get Auberdine, Dwarves and Gnomes get Ironforge, and Humans get Stormwind. On the Horde side, Tauren get Thunder Bluff, Orcs and Trolls get Orgrimmar, and Undead get Undercity.

    * Talent UI has been updated in a few ways. Note: The "greyed-out" versions of talent buttons are using temporary "greyed-out" art.

Version 10.3.5 is a free online upgrade for the base 10.3 OS product. You can download the upgrade by selecting the Software Update menu option under the Apple menu. The change was made due to required GPU-driver fixes in the Mac OS version required by World of Warcraft.
   
   MISCELLANEOUS:
   
    * Hit points gained from STA has been increased, while base hit points have been decreased. Overall, hit point pools should be roughly the same.

    * Mana and health regeneration gained from spirit has been improved.
    * Changes made to what mounts are available at vendors, and faster level-60 mounts have been added. Level-60 mounts are very expensive to purchase however.
    * Mounts now just cost money (not skill points to learn). To gain the ability to ride the mount of another race in your faction you need to improve your reputation with that race. However, the reputation part of the system is not fully completed.
    * Mana now does not regenerate for the five seconds after you cast a spell.
    * Mana pool per INT point has been increased. (this should result in an increase in mana pool size for most characters)

   BUG FIXES:
   
    * Resurrection Sickness now correctly accounts for items and buffs.
    * Fixed a missing gossip text bug for Maybess Riverbreeze in Felwood.

    * Fixed a bug that was causing bags to drop at a much higher rate than they were supposed to.
    * Items that increase healing have been fixed so that they will actually increase the amount of healing a caster does.

 *  MAJOR CHANGES
   NEW MODEL & ANIMATION SYSTEM
   
   There have been extensive changes made to the model and animation system in order to increase performance while playing in densely populated areas (such as cities and PvP encounters). Specifically, we have added hardware vertex shader support and a hardware cursor for those cards that support it. Because we are still transitioning to the new system you will experience some incomplete animation features or graphical glitches while playing this patch. Please report any issues you may find using the /bug command from within the game.
   
   NEW LOOTING METHODS
   
    * Group Loot
   
   When an item equal to or above the threshold (details on threshold below) is on a monster that is killed, everyone gets a pop-up box on their screen with the item and pass or roll options and a timer. Anyone who rolls, displays a number between 1 and 100, the highest roller of all those who choose to roll automatically gets the item. Anyone who waits until the timer expires automatically passes. Items below the threshold are taken care of by normal round robin rules. 
    * Need Before Greed
   
   Same as group loot, except players who cannot use the item automatically pass. 
    * Threshold
   
   This just determines the level of items that are affected by the methods above. If a party wants to set the threshold to blue items and are in group loot mode, then green items that are found will be taken care of by the normal round robin rules. WARLOCK TALENTS ADDED
   
   Warlock talents have been partially implemented. Two talent trees, Destruction and Affliction, are now in the game. Changes continue to be made to Warlock talents, and include modification of the present talents and the addition of a third talent tree to be announced later. Warlocks can now utilize the talent interface by pressing the Talents button next to the Spellbook and Abilities button, or by pressing the N default hotkey.
   
   OTHER CHANGES
   GENERAL

Princess Bronzebeard will now be up for parties adventuring in Blackrock Depths UNLESS everyone in the party has done the questline - at which point the princess will be gone and the High Priestess will be in her place.
    * More Quests added to both Eastern and Western Plaguelands

 *  MAJOR CHANGES
   DURABILITY
   
   Item durability is now in the game. Item durability is an important aspect of World of Warcraft that will work to stabilize the economy, decrease inflation specifically in the high end game, and in general keep prices of player sold items lower than normally would occur without such a feature. Durability should also add additional depth to the game since players will have more variety in their items and more abilities will be added over time to interact with durability. Item durability is different from item decay in that players will never lose items through item durability.
   
   
   Durability key points
   
   
    * All armor and weapons have durability, but not trinkets, cloaks, shirts, guild tabards, necklaces and rings.
    * Items remain at full effectiveness until they have no durability. Their power does not degrade.
    * Items cannot permanently break.
    * All armor/weapon vendors can repair durability in exchange for cash.
    * When an item reaches zero durability, it no longer gives the player any benefit; it acts as though it does not exist until repaired.
    * Professions cannot repair durability, but we will discuss ways for the professions to interact with them in the future.
   
   RAID GROUPS
   
   Raid groups will no longer receive quest bounties and collections. In the future, we plan to have raid-specific quests that will be possible to complete in raid groups.

    *  MAJOR CHANGES
      WINDOWS 98/ME LOADING BUG
      
      There are three common crash errors affecting the World of Warcraft Beta running on Windows 98/ME systems.
      
      
      These are known issues and fixes are currently under development:
      
      
      If you start the game and your computer locks up immediately.
      
      
      Solution:

       4. Start the game by using this shortcut.
       5. You can select a character at the selection screen and then try to enter the world.
      
      
      If after rebooting or when running the game for the first time you crash out with the (FLT_INVALID_OPERATION) error.
      
      
      Solution:
      
       1. Make a shortcut to wow.exe.
       2. Right click on the shortcut and go to properties.
       3. In the shortcut tab, go to the target line and add the following two switches after the quotes so that it reads something similar to: "/patchnotes/path to game/wow.exe" -windowed -opengl
       4. Re-start the game with the shortcut and you should be able to enter the world.
      
      
      If you are able to select your character but your computer locks 1/4 of the way through loading.
      
      
      Solution:
      
       1. Start the game and get to the character selection screen.
       2. When you are at the character selection screen, Alt-Tab out of the game.
       3. You will get a crash
       4. Re-start the game.
       5. Select a character and you should be able to get into the game at this point.
      
      PATCHING
      
      Due to heavy changes in the way we store the games data, this push will be of nearly the same size as your last download. Unfortunately, this means we wont be able to patch this time around, and instead will ask everyone to download the client again.
      
      
      If you haven't already done so, please check your email as we are re-sending you your Authentication Key, so you can have it ready for use with the downloader.
      
      CHARACTER HOLD
      
      All current characters have been placed on hold at this time. This is due in part to all of the changes in our low level areas, the new combat system and the addition of the rest state. We feel that its important to test world advancement from the ground up and we want to take this opportunity to do so.
      
      
      Secondly, with the new skill system in place, we want to find a way to convert older characters to the new system without having to do a character wipe.
      
      REST STATE, INNS & HEARTHSTONES
      
      To broaden and balance some of the gameplay elements, we've incorporated a few new features. One of them is the Rest State modifier, which gives players a time-limited bonus to combat (PvE) experience. This frees up time for exploring other aspects of the game without penalty, such as tradeskilling and social activities, and helps players avoid level-grinding. We've also added Inns, which serve as a good place to hang up your sword or staff for the night because they confer special bonuses. Inns also act as home locations, which our third new feature, Hearthstones, take advantage of. Hearthstones provide a speedy way to travel back to an Inn when you need to take care of business in town or when you're ready to check in and call it a night. The basics of these new features are covered below.
      
      Rest State 
       * The Rest state modifier only affects experience earned from killing monsters. It does not affect experience earned from quest rewards or other experience rewards in the game (such as future PvP experience rewards).
       * As players kill monsters and gain experience points, they become increasingly tired. Their rest level reflects this tiredness in five tiers: well rested, rested, normal, fatigued and exhausted.
       * Well-rested players receive bonus experience points for killing monsters. Rested players receive a smaller bonus. At the normal rest level, players receive no bonus experience points for killing monsters. Fatigued players receive half of the normal experience points from their kills, and when exhausted they will receive a quarter of normal experience from a kill.
       * To become well rested and start earning bonus experience from killing monsters again, players must either log out or rest online at an Inn (see below) for several hours.
       * Thanks to the comforts of a warm bed and a hearty meal, players who rest or log out at an Inn can regain energy up to the maximum level: well rested (it takes 8 hours to go from exhausted back to well rested). Players who log out anywhere else in the world will only regain energy up to the normal level.
       * Note that while your character is resting at an Inn, you can play other characters on your account. The rest state is per character only.
      
      Inns 
       * Players can rest or log out at any Inn in the world.
       * Inns will be located in all major cities and some towns.
       * Whenever players enter an Inn or log out at an Inn, they will effectively be "resting," which is indicated by their portrait flashing yellow.
       * Players can leave an Inn at any time and continue fighting monsters; the experience they gain will be based on the Rest level that they have rested up to.
       * If players log out in an Inn, they will be able to instantly exit the game as opposed to having to wait 20 seconds before exiting.
       * When players log in to play the next day, their well-rested characters will have slept off the ill effects of any nasty debuffs from the day before.
      
      Hearthstones 
       * Players use Hearthstones (an inventory item) to cast a spell that teleports them back to their "home locations." Casting the spell will take a reasonable amount of time, to prevent it from being used as an escape mechanism from combat.
       * "Checking in" with an Innkeeper will make that Inn the player's current home location, and the player's Hearthstone will then take the player back to that Inn (as opposed to any previous home locations). If the player doesn't have a Hearthstone, the Innkeeper will provide one at no cost.
       * Because Hearthstones let players quickly return to town, players can easily log off from within an Inn when they're done playing for the night (or day). If they so choose, players can also use Hearthstones just to return to town to sell items, trade, or train. However, Hearthstones can only be used once per hour.
       * Having home locations in the game will let us incorporate other spells that teleport players to these locations, such as how Astral Recall worked when we had bind stones.
      
      COMBAT CHANGES
      
       * Characters have a new combat stat called "Attack Power." Attack Power helps determine melee damage dealt. The new Attack Power value is displayed in your character sheet as Power. This value is based on class, level and ability scores. Most classes use strength, but rogues and hunters use a combination of strength and agility. The main purpose of Attack Power is to provide a more consistent effect from buffs, regardless of weapon speed. Slow weapons will receive a larger bonus from your Attack Power than faster weapons which will ultimately balance slow and fast weapons. It is important to note that most attack bonuses in the game now add to your Attack Power.
       * The amount of melee damage directly attributed from your weapon has been reduced. Damage is now more closely connected with class, strength and buffs than before. Your weapons are still very meaningful but the combat effect you get from using a higher (or lower) level weapon has been reduced.
       * Block values have been added to shields. Blocking an attack no longer avoids all of the damage of an attack. Blocked attacks avoid an amount of damage based on your shield and your character's strength.
       * Players will now find it more difficult to fight monsters that are a good deal higher in level than they are. Player chance to hit and damage ("glancing blows") are reduced while the monster's chance to hit and damage ("crushing blows") are increased.
       * Miss, Parry, Block, Dodge, Critical Hit, and "Stun from Behind" all have new formulae for determining their percentage chance of occurrence.
       * The effect Spirit has on mana and hit point regeneration has been improved. Spirit affects all characters' mana and hit point regeneration rates in and out of combat.
       * Your chance to hit with each weapon when fighting with two weapons has gone down, but the total hits from both weapons has gone up. Your total damage output when fighting with two weapons should be higher than fighting with one weapon and a shield, but roughly equal to fighting with a two-handed weapon.
       * Off-hand attacks deal of the weapon's designated damage.
      
      NEW SKILL SYSTEM
      
      The new skill system is in place! Players now earn skill points based on experience points gained from killing monsters. Earned skill points can be spent on tradeskills, weapon proficiencies or to increase attributes.
      
      
      The new skill UI is in place. You will be able to increase your attributes by spending skill points. Attributes will cost different amounts to increase depending on your class. Attributes with a green bar are your characters primary attributes and will cost the least, while attributes displayed with a red bar are less necessary attributes and will be the most expensive.
      
      
      New Weapon skills will now be purchased with skill points allowing a wider variety of weapons being available to any given class. Different weapons will have different skill point costs associated with them.
      
      
      Finally, tradeskills will still be purchased with skill points. You will still need to buy the tradeskills at the tradeskill trainer.
      
      TALENTS DISABLED
      
      Some of the talent functionality, like increasing attributes, has been moved to our new skill system. The rest of the Talent system is being reworked and therefore disabled. Don't worry, you will get talents back, and they will be even cooler than before!
      
      MONSTER CLAIMING
      
      Now the first player or group to damage a monster will "tap" them. When the tapped monster dies, that player or group will get the experience and loot from the kill. Other players will be able to tell if a monster is tapped because it's portrait will turn grey. Players are free to help kill the tapped monster, but they will receive no experience or loot from the kill. Even with help, the player or group who initially tapped the monster will gain full experience from the kill. In situations where a much higher level player helped with the kill, some of the experience reward will be reduced.
      
      EXPERIENCE DISTRIBUTION CHANGES
      
      As players become higher level, they will be able to receive experience from a large range of monsters. At low levels, you may get experience from monsters 5 levels lower than you, while at level 60 you will gain experience from monsters 12 levels lower. In the future we will add a user interface to monster portraits so you will always know which monsters give experience for your level.
      
      QUEST REWARDS
      
      Quest rewards are now labeled as Bind on Acquire. Quest rewards can still be equipped or sold to a merchant, but you will no longer be able to sell or give them to other players. This has been implemented to deter these items from flooding the game economy.
      
      WORLD
      
      Many objects in the world such as buildings, dungeons and cities have undergone a significant data format change to reduce memory usage, increase render performance and minimize future patch sizes.
      
      CLOAKS
      
      Due to popular demand, cloaks have been made visible. This will help players customize their characters even more than before.
      
      OTHER CHANGES
      DEATH SYSTEM
      
       * Bodies will decompose after a player is resurrected or revived. We are working on some better art to represent this process.
       * The corpse retrieval area has increased to 40 yards.
       * Players that revive will now have 50% health and mana.
       * Spirit healers are now ghosts and can only be seen by players in ghost form.
       * Players can no longer use ghost form as a means to travel to far off locations. Having a spirit healer resurrect you in a graveyard other than the one you appeared at when you died, will always teleport you back to that initial graveyard.
       * Players can now use all of the UI in ghost form (i.e. move things around in your backpack, read your quest log, interact with your spellbook etc.)
      
      CITIES/ZONES
      
       * Darnassus, Stormwind, Orgrimmar and Undercity have all undergone layout changes.
       * Swamp of Sorrows, Dustwallow Marsh, Desolace and Badlands are now open and itemized.
       * Inns have been added to the following towns throughout the world for resting: Goldshire, Lakeshire, Darkshire, Kharanos, Thelsamar, Menethil, Southshore, Dolanaar, Auberdine, Astranaar, Razor Hill, Bloodhoof Village, Crossroads, Ratchet, Booty Bay, Brill, Tirisfal, Stonard, Swamp of Sorrows, Theramore, Dustwallow Marsh and all major cities.
       * Early versions of our mapping and exploration system are in and working in Elwynn, Teldrassil, Dun Morogh, Tirisfal Glades, Mulgore and Durotar. More functionality will be added to these maps in future patches.
       * Westfall Lumber Mill now has lumberjacks working around it.
       * Guards in Stormwind now provide directions for those who ask. (Coming soon to all cities.)
      
      DUNGEONS
      
       * Blackfathom Deeps, a level 20 - 27 dungeon is now opened and itemized in Northern Ashenvale.
       * The Scarlet Monastery, a level 30 - 40 dungeon is now opened and itemized in Tirisfal Glades.

    *  MAJOR CHANGES
      STANDARD PLAYER VS. ENVIRONMENT SERVER
      
      Currently, players now have the ability to attack almost all opposing faction NPCs including vendors and quest givers. If a player attacks an opposing faction NPC, players of the opposite faction are then able to target and attack that player. Whenever an NPC is attacked, players who share the same faction as that NPC will receive a system message indicating that a specific town is under attack.
      
      
      Please be aware that some quest NPCs might not always be available. If they have been killed, players should wait for the NPC to respawn. The development team expects there to be some bugs associated with this so be sure to /bug and /suggest whenever necessary.
      
      
      Actions that will enable PvP on the standard player vs. environment server are: attacking an NPC of the opposing faction, attacking a player who attacked an NPC, and/or aiding a player engaged in PvP. Players will also have the ability to enable PvP on their own by using the /pvp command. Once PvP has been enabled by a player, no matter what the method, it will remain in effect for five minutes.
      
      
      In time, all standard servers will include a consensual Player vs. Player system called Battlegrounds. Once Battlegrounds has been implemented, players will have the ability to attack other players to defend their cities and towns from invasion. We expect the Battlegrounds system to be available later during the beta test.
      
      HORDE VS. ALLIANCE RACE WAR SERVER
      
      The new Horde vs. Alliance race war server will establish a straightforward method for the development team to test and balance the races and classes in a PvP environment. PvP concepts will be gradually introduced on this server. This means that the initial implementation of PvP is not how our final model will work once World of Warcraft is released. This patch includes the fundamental ideas of PvP in order to tune and refine the very foundation of our PvP model.
      
      
      On the Horde vs. Alliance race war server, territories will be indicated whenever a player enters a new zone. The zone name will now include additional information to inform the player of the territories status. Additionally, the mini-map will be color coded to indicate who controls the zone: Green = Friendly, Red = Enemy and Yellow = Contested.
      
      
      Players will be able to initiate player vs. player combat based on what territory they are in. Players in friendly territories are safe unless they decide to engage an opposing faction player in combat. Players in enemy territories will always be at risk and can be attacked by all players that belong in the territory. All players can be attacked in neutral (contested) territories.
      
      
      Actions that will enable a player for PvP status on the Horde vs. Alliance race war server will be: entering or being in an enemy territory, entering or being in a contested territory, attacking an NPC of the opposing faction, attacking another player, and/or aiding a player engaged in PvP. Players will also be able to enable PvP on their own by using the /pvp command. Once PvP has been enabled for a player, no matter what the method, it will remain in effect for five minutes.
      
      REST STATE CHANGES
      
      The Rest State system has undergone several changes. There are now three tiers of rest states: Rested = 200% experience, Normal = 150% experience and Tired = 100% experience.
      
      
      The rest timer is much more flexible than before, allowing players to gradually accumulate incremental rest credit for all time spent logged out. Additionally, people who do not log into World of Warcraft for several days will gain bonus rest credit. This will allow those who only play once or twice a week the added bonus of playing as rested (200% experience) for longer periods of time than those who play on a daily basis.
      
      
      Players also have the ability to rest anywhere in the world. This should help players who forget or choose not to log off at an inn. Resting at an inn is still the preferred method, as rest credit will accumulate four times faster for players logged off inside of an inn.
      
      
      Lastly, the Rest State modifier is now level-based using a sliding scale to determine how much experience you can gain at each tier instead of the previous flat 20,000 experience per level.
      
      ENTER THE CITY TO REST
      
      When visiting one of the six main cities (Darnassus, Ironforge, Orgrimmar, Stormwind, Thunder Bluff and The Undercity), players will no longer need to check into the inn to rest. Players will however still need to seek an innkeeper to receive a hearthstone or to bind themselves to the city.
      
      
      In this initial implementation, there will be some areas close to the cities that will allow a player to rest without actually being in the city. There are also some areas within each city that are not currently activated for resting. Please be sure to check the character portrait to ensure that the character is resting before logging off. The team is aware of this and will continue to work through these areas.
      
      
      As before, you will still need to rest at an Inn in smaller towns.
      
      SKILL SYSTEM CHANGES
      
      The focus of the skill system is to allow characters the ability to choose secondary skills. As such, attributes will now raise automatically when a character levels. As a result of this change, characters will receive fewer skill points than before.
      
      
      Current characters may lose some skill points to compensate for the redesign of the Skill System. In some instances, characters may fall into a negative skill point status if they have already spent more skill points than the new system will a lot them.
      
      OLD CHARACTERS UNLOCKED
      
      All of the older characters from previous patches have been unlocked and are available once again. The older characters have all been assigned skill points as appropriate for their levels. Their talents have been disabled.
      
      ITEMS DELETED
      
      With a few exceptions, all items and currency are being deleted for this patch. The following items will not be deleted: Bags, Scarlet Key, all Shaman Totems and the [Hearthstone]. Each character will be assigned funds based on their level.
      
      
      Players will be able to redo quests that have already been completed in order to gain back quest items.
      
      QUESTS RESET
      
      All quest progress for existing characters has been reset. Characters have the ability to go back and redo all quests if they wish. For players that were in the middle of a quest chain, those quests will need to be restarted from the beginning.
      
      
      Quests were reset to allow players the means for reacquiring lost quest items and to participate in the many quests that have been fixed and rebalanced.
      
      RESISTANCES
      
      The beginnings of the new resistance system are in the game. Players and some creatures now have the ability to resist damage from offensive spells and abilities based on their total resistance, their level and the level of the person or creature causing the damage.
      
      
      New items, with better resistances, will be available in the future.
      
      INTRODUCTION CINEMATIC FOR ALL RACES
      
      A cinematic is now available for each race and will be played after character creation takes place.
      
      POSTAL SYSTEM INTRODUCED
      
      Players now have the ability to send and receive in-game mail through World of Warcraft's postal system. Every inn has a mailbox that players can right click in order to access mailbox functionality.
      
      
      There are several types of mail:
      
      
       * Normal Mail: This is text only mail written on stationery. Normal mail may also include money.
       * Package: Players will receive a package when an item is sent to them. A package can also include a text message and money.
       * C.O.D: Players will receive a C.O.D. mail when an item has been sent to them that they still need to pay for. C.O.D. mail will need to be accepted and paid for, rejected or postponed until its expiration date.
      
      
      Normal Mail will arrive at its destination immediately while Packages and C.O.D items will take one hour to arrive.
      
      
       * Normal mail: expires in 30 days, deleted when expired.
       * Package: expires in 30 days, returned to sender when expired.
       * C.O.D.: expires in 3 days, returned to sender when expired.
      
      
      Mail can be sent to players by NPCs.
      
      LEVEL CAP RAISED
      
      The level cap has been increased to 45. New zones, quests, items and content have been added to accommodate the level increase along with the ability to purchase and ride mounts!
      
      MOUNTS
      
      Race specific mounts are now available. A player can train in any mount; however, the skill points necessary to train for a mount assigned to a different race will cost significantly more skill points.
      
      
      The Warlock spell to summon the Nightmare, a Warlock specific mount, is available as well. The Paladin's class specific mount, the Charger, will be available at a later date.
      
      WIDE SCREEN SUPPORT
      
      Support for wide screen ratios (16:9, 16:10 and 5:4) have been added as a fullscreen choice. The video options have been enhanced to list individual display resolution modes. At this time, windowed mode will still be limited to a 4:3 ratio.
      
      MACINTOSH OS UPGRADE
      
      World of Warcraft beta testers using the Macintosh version will need to upgrade their OS to OS X 10.3.4 or World of Warcraft will not run. OS X 10.3.4 is a free upgrade from any previous 10.3 releases and contains OpenGL drivers that are now necessary for World of Warcraft to operate on a Macintosh system.

 *  MAJOR CHANGES
   AUCTION HOUSES
   
   Auctioneer NPCs have been placed in each major city (Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Orgrimmar, Thunder Bluff and The Undercity). The Auctioneer's are faction specific, allowing Alliance characters to trade with other Alliance characters and Horde characters to trade with other Horde characters. Each city's Auction House is run independently; all Auctioneers that exist in the same city are all a part of the same Auction House.
   
   
   One non-faction based Auction House is located in Booty Bay. The Booty Bay Auctioneer NPCs have the same functionality as the aforementioned faction based Auction Houses, with the additional capability of allowing trade between Horde and Alliance characters.
   
   
   Sellers are able to place items up for auction, set a starting price, set the auction duration and include a buyout price by speaking with an Auctioneer.
   
   
   All auctions will be initially charged a deposit fee; the deposit fee is refunded upon the successful sale of the item. All successful sales are charged an auction consignment fee which is extracted directly from the final sale price. All fees are higher in Booty Bay.
   
   
   Buyers are able to search through items up for auction, place bids and purchase items that include buyout prices by speaking with the Auctioneer. Players are not able to place bids on items being sold by a character on their own account.
   
   
   All items won at an Auction House will be delivered through the in-game mail system.
   
   TALENT SYSTEM
   
   Talents are now available for the Warrior and Mage classes! Players can open the talent interface by using the "Talents" button which resides next to the "Spellbook and Abilities" button, or by pressing the "N" default hotkey.
   
   
   Talents will eventually be available for all classes.
   
   PVP CHANGES
   
   Players that die in PvP, either versus another player or versus a PvP-Flagged NPC must now wait 2 minutes before resurrecting at their corpse. This delay does not apply to players that are resurrected by other players or by using resurrection items.
   
   
   Control types of spells such as Charm, Fear and Stun will now be subject to diminishing returns. This means that if a second spell of the same type is used against the same player within 15 seconds of the first effect wearing off, the second spell's duration will be reduced by 50%, the third's duration will be reduced by 75% and the player will be immune to the fourth casting.
   
   CLICK TO MOVE
   
   A new option has been added under Video Options called Click to Move (by default this option is off). Players will need to turn it on to use this new functionality by clicking on Options, Video Options and then checking the radio box next to Click to Move.
   
   
   Click to Move is an auto-interaction feature that will allow players to do several things by using their mouse. With Click to Move turned on, a player can do the following:
   
   
    * Right click on the ground to move to that location.
    * Right click on a creature to automatically move to that creature and initiate combat.
    * Cast a benefit spell and left click on a friendly player to automatically move within casting range and cast that spell.
    * Select monster and left click on a ranged weapon or spell icon to automatically move within shooting range and initiate combat by shooting the weapon or casting that spell.
   
   
   We are aware of several problems with this new interface. Please use the /bug feedback form to submit any bugs that you find.
   
   REST STATE CHANGES
   
   The Rest State system has undergone several changes. There are now two tiers of rest states: Rested = 200% experience and Normal = 100% experience.
   
   
   At level one, players will all start in the normal tier. When a player rests be it in a city or at an inn they will gain rest bonus at a very slow rate. Eight hours of rest will be needed for a player to gain one "bubble" of rest bonus. At any given time, players will be able to accumulate a maximum of 30 "bubbles" worth of rest bonus which translates into approximately 1.5 levels worth of rested play (before your character returns to normal rest state).
   
   
   The changes to the Rest State have been made with the understanding that most players will be in the Normal experience tier most of the time. The Rested tier is primarily intended for players that take a day or more off from playing or are very casual with their play schedules. This has enabled us to greatly reduce the experience necessary for all players to level regardless of which rest state tier they play under.
   
   NEW GUARD SYSTEM
   
   A new guard system has been added. This new system will enable NPCs to call for guards when they see an enemy as well as when they are attacked. The guards will chase players and then return to the NPC that called for help once they lose track of, or kill the player. If a guard is killed, another guard will be called to take its place. There is a limit to how many guards each town can have which will recharge over time. The cities that currently have the new Guard System in place are: Astranaar, Auberdine, Bloodhoof Village, Brill, Crossroads, Goldshire, Razor Hill, Sen'jin Village, Sentinel Hill, Sepulcher and Thelsamar. The Guard System will be implemented in other cities in future patches.

 *  MAJOR CHANGES
   HUNTERS
   
   The Hunter Class is now available to test! Hunters track, tame, and slay all manner of animals and beasts found in the wild. Whether they rely on bows or firearms, Hunters consider their weapons and pets to be their only true friends. Races allowed to become Hunters are the Night Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Tauren, and Troll.
   
   
   Hunters are great for pulling monsters as they are able to set traps that hinder monsters that the Hunters pull to attack. Hunters are also able to use various beast-related special abilities, take on bestial traits that give them supernatural powers, control and tame beasts, and use a wide variety of ranged attacks complimented by a few melee abilities.
   
   
   Hunters are closely related to their pets and must remember to always keep their pet's happiness in mind. When using a pet, Hunters will notice an icon in the top left corner of their screen that depicts their pet's happiness. The more Hunters use their pets, the lower their pet's level of happiness will become. Hunters should always remember to feed their pets to raise their pet's level of happiness or worry about their pet abandoning them or even attacking the Hunter! Hunters are also the only class able to name their pets.
   
   
   The Hunter can use the following weapons: Axes, Daggers, Guns or Bows, Crossbows (with training), Fist Weapons (with training), Spears (with training), Staves (with training), Swords, (with training), Thrown (with training), Two-Handed Axes (with training), Two-Handed Swords (with training). The Hunter can use the following armor: Cloth, Leather, Shields, and Mail (at level 40, with training).
   
   BOATS AND ZEPPELINS
   
   Our first pass at Boats and Zeppelins has been added to the world in two locations. A boat has been added between Booty Bay and Ratchet, and a Zeppelin has been added between Orgrimmar and Tirisfal. A second zeppelin has also been added between Grom'gol and Orgrimmar. The round trip on all three of these new transports is around five minutes, with a pause at each destination of one minute each. If you miss a transport, you will have a very short wait before it returns. If you log out or crash during your journey, you will log back in on the same transport you were on when you logged out, although you will likely be at a different location along its path. Because this was the original intention for our world travel, the instant teleport NPCs have been removed. Please do not jump off of Boats and/or Zeppelins when riding them. Keep in mind that the Goblin Transit Authority is not responsible for accidents of this nature and you may land in a place where you cannot reach your corpse.
   
   TALENT SYSTEM
   
   Talents are now available for the Priest and Rogue classes! Priest and Rogue players can now utilize the talent interface by using the "Talents" button, which resides next to the "Spellbook and Abilities" button, or by pressing the "N" default hotkey.
   
   
   Talents for other classes will continue to be added as the beta progresses. Please note that all Mages and Warriors have had their talent points refunded. You will now start earning talent points at level 10.
   
   
   Finally, for the duration of the beta, you will be able to find an NPC in each city that will allow you to reset your talent points and experiment with different talent paths. (Note: this option is ONLY available in the beta).
   
   LEVEL CAP RAISED
   
   The level cap has been increased to 55. New zones, quests, items, and content have been added to accommodate the level increase.
   
   ITEM STATS CHANGED
   
   Items have had a major overhaul. Armor values, damage, stats, and resists have been modified to reflect current play balance. Some items have also had their level requirements changed. Items that were subjected to this change and that were equipped on a character prior to the patch have been placed in the character's bag. If a character did not have space in its bags, please make room in that character's bags and re-login. Below are additional changes to items in general.
   
   
    * Several axes, swords, and maces were changed from main hand only to either hand for dual-wielding purposes.
    *  [Horned Viking Helmet] has been updated with a new effect.

   SHARING QUESTS
   
   You can now share your quests with your entire party. In order to utilize this option, you need to open your quest log, select a quest, and press the "Share Quest" button. All members of your party will now be presented with the quest like you were the quest giver NPC. Some restrictions:
   
   
    * You can only share with party members
    * Party members must be nearby when you share
    * Party members must meet the pre-requisites of the quest itself. For example, if you are on step 2 of a quest and your friend is still on step 1, you could not give him a "short-cut" to step 2.
    * Quests generated from items cannot be shared.
   
   NEW MICRO-DUNGEON DESIGNS
   
   The Level Designers have gone in to the game and redesigned some of the Goldmine and Mushroom Cave Micro-Dungeons. Players can now find these redesigned Micro-Dungeons in both Alliance and Horde lands.
   
   
   Goldmines in Hillsbrad Foothills, Mulgore, and Blasted Lands have been redesigned.
   
   
   Mushroom Caves in Searing Gorge, Wetlands, Western Plaguelands, Felwood, Hinterlands, Swamp of Sorrows, Arathi Highlands, Ungoro Crater, Deadwind Pass, Stranglethorn, and Redridge have been redesigned.

   Alliance -- Faol's Rest Horde -- Deathknell FACTION/REPUTATION
   
    * Ratchet, Gadgetzan, and Booty Bay now utilize our most current system of factions and reputation adjustments. Assaulting bankers, vendors, transportation specialists, etc., may result in a loss of permanent reputation with these cities.
    * The "Steamwheedle Cartel" faction represents the neutral goblin state that is comprised of Booty Bay in the Eastern Kingdoms, and Gadgetzan and Ratchet in Kalimdor. Affecting your reputation in one of these cities will affect it in the others.
    * Players start out Neutral with the above-mentioned factions. Losing reputation will result eventually in becoming Unfriendly with the local populace; names and target reticules will appear in orange to indicate this status. While reputation remains at Unfriendly, players cannot interact with vendors, trainers, etc. that are of the faction in question.
    * Below Unfriendly is Hostile reputation and finally Hated reputation. Both of these are indicated by red names and target reticules.

   NEW RAID ENCOUNTERS

Both factions will need to complete unique, and challenging quests to gain access to the Onyxia encounter. **During the beta testing there will be a temporary placeholder vendor who sells keys to Onyxia’s lair for testing purposes. Discovered in the heart of Blackrock Mountain beyond the Depths, lies the Molten Core. Within the Molten Core lives a multitude of ancient and powerful evil. Adventurers be ware, for the dangers found within the Molten Core are many and takes many forms. ** Raid loot is being worked on and temporary loot has been placed in raid encounters NEW KODO MOUNTS!
   There is but one creature in all of Kalimdor that possesses the strength and stamina to bear a tauren rider into battle: the majestic kodo beast. Swifter and slightly smaller than their wild cousins, kodo mounts nevertheless demonstrate the same resilience and fearlessness found in their untamed brethren, traits that serve them well when bearing their equally resolute riders. It is said that only the most virtuous of tauren can win the affection of a kodo war mount, for these mighty beasts only serve those that approach them with honor and respect in their hearts. Tauren players will no longer have the Plainsrunning ability, due to the availability of Kodo mounts! Tauren players can purchase the Kodo mount at Bloodhoof village. ** Currently there is an active bug that prevents players from purchasing mounts from different races regarding of reputation, this bug will be addressed in the next patch.

NEW HIGH-LEVEL ARMOR SETS!

Weather has been introduced in the following areas around Azeroth:


 * Elwynn Forest
 * Tirisfal Glades
 * Dun Morogh
 * Darkshore
 * Alterac Mountains
 * Stranglethorn Vale
 * Feralas
 * Un'Goro Crater
 * Tanaris

We will be adding more weather to the world as time progresses; this is simply the beginning!

HIGH-LEVEL INSTANCE CHANGES

Along with the new Armor Sets, the high-level 5-10 man dungeons have received some changes regarding loot. Many items have been improved in quality and use. In addition, several epic items, such as Headmaster's Charge and the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare, have had their drop rates significantly increased. In order to preserve the challenge of these dungeons, they have had their instance caps lowered. Stratholme, Scholomance, and Blackrock Depths now allow a maximum of five players inside, and Blackrock Spire allows a maximum of ten.

QUEST EXPERIENCE TO GOLD CONVERSION AT LEVEL 60

Previously, quest experience was wasted if one completed a quest at level 60. In this patch, any quests done at maximum level will have their experience reward converted to a healthy amount of gold, thus adding additional incentive to completing those quests in your log once you hit 60.

NEW FINAL DESTINATION FLIGHT PATHS!

If you're making several jumps to get to your destination, you will now be able to choose that flight path from your initial Flight Master. The costs will remain the same, but you no longer need to manually click on each path. The UI has also been improved significantly.

HUNTERS

 *  [Multi-Shot] - This ability now has its attack power normalized the same as melee instant attacks. This means that the attack power contribution from all ranged weapons will be the same, no matter what their speed. All weapons will contribute attack power as if they were 2.8 speed. Weapons slower than 2.8 speed will do slightly less damage than previously; weapons faster than 2.8 speed will do slightly more damage.

 *  [Arcane Brilliance] - Range and area of effect increased.
 *  [Impact] - When a fire spell is reflected back at the caster, the caster will now correctly receive the Impact effect.

 *  [Judgement of Justice] - This judgement will now always hit.
 *  [Righteous Fury] - Righteous Fury will now always generate the correct amount of additional threat on all holy damage. There were some abilities, such as Retribution Aura, where this did not work correctly.
 *  [Holy Shock] - This ability now works with Divine Favor and Illumination.
 *  [Holy Shield] - Mana cost reduced approximately 15%. The effect now has a small bonus coefficient from spell damage items and effects.
 *  [Eye for an Eye] - This talent can now trigger while you are mounted.
 *  [Blessing of Sacrifice] - This Blessing can no longer be used to prevent the death of a target that is supposed to die for a spell effect (e.g.: [Sacrifice], [Demonic Sacrifice], [Divine Intervention], [Ritual of Doom]).
 *  [Seal of Command] - Will now be able to proc when the Paladin is silenced.
 * Improved Seal of Righteousness - Tooltip updated to reflect actual functionality. This talent increases [Seal of Righteousness] and Judgement of Righteousness by 3-15%.
 *  [Lay on Hands] - Range increased.
 *  [Divine Intervention] - Range increased.

 * Most creatures that were previously immune to Scorpid Sting are now also immune to the Paladin Talent [Vindication].
 * Fixed problem where occasionally repeated casts of [Consecration] will not deal damage.
 * If a paladin avoids damage with [Divine Shield], [Eye for an Eye] will not react.
 * Fixed stacking of Paladin auras so they overlap, but only the best aura in a given category is in effect.

PRIESTS

 * Due to significant talent changes, Priests will have all talent points refunded and can be respent. Training costs for all talent spell replacements have been significantly reduced.
 * All racial priest spell replacements have had their training costs reduced.
 *  [Prayer of Fortitude] - Range and area of effect increased.
 *  [Holy Fire] - Is now available to all priests, starting at level 20.
 *  [Mind Soothe] - Is now instant cast.
 *  [Shadowform] - Now reduces all physical damage taken (melee and ranged), as the tooltip suggests.

 *  [Elune's Grace] (Night Elf) - Now also increases chance to dodge. Ranged damage reduction increased, duration decreased, mana cost decreased, now has a cooldown.
 *  [Shadowguard] (Troll) - Is now instant cast. Updated tooltip to reflect that damage caused by Shadowguard causes no threat. This was previously the case, but was undocumented.

The healing debuff does not stack with the warrior's Mortal Strike ability, although the damage penalty now stacks with either Touch of Weakness or Curse of Weakness. Mana cost decreased substantially.
 *  [Starshards] (Night Elf) - This spell now works like Curse of Agony, with lower initial damage which increases as the duration continues. Mana cost dropped approximately 30% on all ranks. Ranks 1 and 2 increased to 6 second duration. Damage increased approximately 17%.
 *  [Lesser Heal] - Mana cost dropped approximately 9%.
 *  [Heal] - Ranks 2, 3, and 4, cast time reduced to 3 seconds. Rank 1 mana cost dropped approximately 9%. Rank 2, 3, and 4 the healing amount has been reduced to generate the same amount of healing per cast time as before the cast time was reduced. Rank 2, 3, and 4, the mana cost was reduced to cost approximately 9% less mana per point of healing generated. The net effect on all ranks is that the healing per mana is 10% higher, the cast time is limited to 3 seconds, and the healing per second is unchanged. Note that spells with less than 3.5 second cast time will not receive the full bonus from plus healing items.
 *  [Greater Heal] - Cast time reduced to 3 seconds. Healing and Mana cost reduced so that the healing per second is unchanged, but the healing per mana is increased approximately 10%. Note that spells with less than 3.5 second cast time will not receive the full bonus from plus healing items.

SHAMAN

 *  [Lightning Shield] - Bonfires and other environmental damage sources will no longer consume charges of the Lightning Shield. Warsong Gulch power-ups will also no longer consume the charges.

ITEMS

 * Relics have been introduced to the game. These are class specific items for Druids, Paladins, and Shaman which can be equipped in the ranged slot. Currently there are a handful for each class which can be found scattered throughout Blackrock Depths, Blackrock Spire, Dire Maul, Scholomance, Stratholme, and The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj. We hope that you enjoy the first round of available relics and we will continue to add more in future patches.
 * Many items in Blackrock Depths, Stratholme, Scholomance, and Blackrock Spire have been re-evaluated and adjusted to make them more appealing. In addition several new items have been added to all of these instances.
 * The following item sets have had their set bonuses adjusted: Valor, Magister's, Lightforge, Shadowcraft, Dreadmist, Devout, Wildheart, Beaststalker, and Elements.

 * The tooltip on Thunderfury has been clarified to indicate that only the primary target will receive the slowing effect. In addition, the two effects have been broken down into two different debuffs to prevent incorrect information from appearing in the debuff tooltip for secondary targets (previously secondary targets were told they were slowed when they were not actually slowed).
 *  [Wrath of Cenarius] will now trigger off all damaging spells.
 * The charges from the [Zandalarian Hero Charm] will now be consumed by melee and ranged abilities and spells which do non-physical damage. This includes: [Hammer of Wrath], Judgement of Righteousness, [Seal of Command], Judgement of Command, [Volley], and [Arcane Shot]. The trinket will also now burn charges from each casting of a damage over time spell, heal over time spell, and area aura spells such as [Blizzard] and [Consecration]. Only one charge will be burned per area spell cast, rather than multiple charges per target hit as was previously the case.

 * Many Recipes now have different icons. Recipe icons should correspond with the item color; a green-glowing scroll is a green recipe, and a blue-glowing scroll is a blue recipe, for example.

USER INTERFACE

 * The Reputation UI has gotten a significant overhaul:
    * You can now click on a faction in the reputation pane to get additional details/options.
    * You can display one of your reputations on your main display where your experience bar currently displays. If you are not level 60 it displays two thin bars - experience and reputation.

SHADOW OF THE NECROPOLIS

Horrors of the past and new terrors yet to be unleashed are gathering inside the necropolis as the Lich King's servants prepare their assault. The Scourge marches again...


Naxxramas is the new 40-man raid dungeon that will present even the most experienced and powerful players with an epic challenge.

GENERAL

 * The cost to unlearn talents will now decay over time. This cost will be reduced by a rate of 5 gold per month to a minimum of 10 gold.
 * Logging back in after a disconnect from the server has been greatly improved, and players should now rarely receive the message "A character with that name already exists."
 * Temporary item buffs (e.g. poisons, sharpening stones and shaman weapon buffs) will persist through zoning or logging out.
 * Fear: The calculations to determine if Fear effects should break due to receiving damage have been changed. The old calculation used the base damage of the ability. The new calculation uses the final amount of damage dealt, after all modifiers. In addition, the chance for a damage over time spell to break Fear is now significantly lower. Note that Fear continues to be roughly three times as likely to break on player targets as on non-player targets. In addition, [Intimidating Shout] now follows that player versus non-player distinction, while previously it did not.
 * Periodic Healing: Spells which do periodic healing will now have their strength determined at the moment they are cast. Changing the amount of bonus healing you have during the duration of the periodic spell will have no impact on how much it heals for.
 * Reflection: Effects which cause reflection will no longer reflect triggered effects separately from their base effects (e.g. Impact, Improved Shadow Bolt, Aftermath, etc.)
 * Spell and Item Auras with Charges: These auras will now correctly remember their number of charges when you enter or leave an instance, change continents, or log out.
 * All controlled units will now be titled based on the creature type. All beasts will be referred to as Pets, for example (no matter how they are controlled). Previously, there were several inconsistencies.
 * Beneficial spells and abilities that target multiple units will no longer consume resources (i.e. mana, rage etc...) if they fail to affect anyone.
 * Chain targeted spells and abilities (e.g. Multi-shot, [Cleave], [Chain Lightning]) will no longer land if target cannot be seen by the caster due to stealth or invisibility.
 * Character model transparency has been modified to fix an issue where PC's would appear to have a large hole in their model (be on the lookout!).
 * Optimization code known as "M2Faster" is now enabled by default. M2Faster can improve performance in crowded scenes when "Vertex Animation Shaders" is turned on. This function can be turned off by setting M2Faster to "0" in the config.wtg.
    * Reduces the unique number of vertex shader permutations that we will choose to use in rendering
    * Sorts the drawing of items in the scene a little differently to reduce the number of times we re-program the vertex shader hardware.
   
   

PVP

 * In an effort to keep their armies better outfitted the Horde and Alliance have both taken it upon themselves to update their available rewards.

 *  [Nature's Grace]: You will no longer consume this effect when casting a spell which was made instant by [Nature's Swiftness].
 *  [Swiftmend]: This new talent has been added to the Druid Restoration tree, replacing Innervate as the 31 point ultimate talent. It consumes a [Rejuvenation] or [Regrowth] aura to produce an instant heal.
 *  [Enrage]: Tooltip edited to clarify functionality.

HUNTERS

 *  [Counterattack] (Survival Talent) - All ranks of this talent will now share the same cooldown.
 *  [Scorpid Poison]: Duration slightly lengthened.

 * Improved Scorpid Sting: The aura from this Sting will now be removed (as intended) when a different Sting aura is placed on the victim.

PALADINS

 * Benediction: This talent will no longer incorrectly provide a double discount to [Seal of Justice].
 *  [Blessing of Light]: It is no longer possible for a target to appear to have multiple ranks of Blessing of Light. These multiple auras had no beneficial effect, merely causing confusion. Problems with targeting the spell when the caster has Blessing of Light effect on them have also been fixed.

 * Illumination: When several critical effect healing spells are cast very quickly, you will now receive the correct mana refund for each one.

 *  [Mind Control]: If you cast [Power Word: Shield] while Mind Controlling a target, the Recently Shielded aura will now appear on the correct target instead of yourself.
 *  [Spirit of Redemption]: This spell has a number of fixes: Spirit of Redemption form now has casting animations. Priests prematurely leaving battlegrounds with this aura on will now receive the Deserter debuff (as intended); Priests in Spirit of Redemption form at the completion of a battleground will have the aura removed without dying; It will now work correctly with the Darkmoon Card Twisting Nether item, resurrecting you after Spirit of Redemption has run its course; If you should die underwater the Spirit of Redemption will no longer have a breath bar appear; the Warlock [Drain Soul] spell will terminate producing 1 shard when the Priest switches to Spirit of Redemption form; You will no longer have to wait 30 seconds for graveyard resurrection upon your first death while using Spirit of Redemption.
 *  [Vampiric Embrace]: This ability will no longer heal for damage caused when the target had no life remaining.
 * Shadowguard: This Troll Priest racial spell now works with Vampiric Embrace, [Blackout], and [Shadow Weaving].

 * We have re-evaluated the mechanics of consumable items in the game and concluded that these should work in a more intuitive manner. As such, most items that can not be equipped with right click abilities have been streamlined into one of three categories. Using an item of a particular category will trigger a shared cooldown among all other items in the same category. The categories break down as follows with category cooldowns as listed.
    * Potions 2 minutes: This includes items such as Health Potion, [Mana Potion], [Invisibility Potion] and [Mighty Rage Potion].

When this is turned on, anytime a player is in a party or raid, it will show the portrait and health of whatever your current target has targeted. You can click on that portrait to target that thing directly or if you have the spell glove up you can cast spells on the target of target without targeting it directly.
 * Bags that you are carrying now have a brown background when opened and bags that are in your bank have a gray background when opened. This will allow a player to more easily tell the difference between a bag they are carrying and one that is in their bank.

DETAILS
GENERAL

 * Threat Reduction Effects
    * This system has been redesigned to eliminate inconsistency in how the effects work. Previously, some were additive (for example: 30% reduction + 20% reduction = 50% reduction) while others were multiplicative (30% reduction and 20% reduction made 44% reduction, from 0.7*0.8). They are now all multiplicative. This also prevents unpredictable behavior when the total reduction percentage was equal to or greater than 100%. Please note that in almost all cases, when stacking multiple threat reduction effects you will experience less threat reduction than previously.
   
   
 * Haste and Slow effects
    * Previously Haste and Slow effects worked inconsistently, with spells working differently from weapons, and hastes and slows not acting as inverses of each other. We have revised the system so that all haste and slow effects work the same way, and haste and slow percentages of the same magnitude perfectly cancel each other out (30% haste and 30% slow combine to no change). As a result, we had to change the tooltip numbers on all spell haste effects, and on all melee and range slow effects. The numbers in the tooltips are different, but the game functionality is unchanged (other than slight rounding errors). Those tooltips that changed will now display larger numbers than they used to display. Conceptually, haste values indicate how much more of that activity you can perform in a given time. 30% melee haste means 30% more swings in a given time. Slow values indicate how much longer an activity takes to complete. 30% slow means an action takes 30% longer to finish.
   
   
 * The deserter debuff will now continue to expire even while you are offline.
 * Honorable Kills now diminish at a rate 10% per kill rather than 25% per kill.
 * Temporary item buffs (e.g. poisons, sharpening stones and shaman weapon buffs) will no longer persist through zoning or logging out due to technical issues. This feature is anticipated to be activated once more with the expansion.

DRUIDS

 *  [Barkskin]: The tooltip has been changed to 25% due to the haste effect change.
 *  [Cat Form]: This form now has an innate threat reduction component.
 *  [Ferocious Bite]: Book of Ferocious Bite (Rank 5) now drops off The Beast in Blackrock Spire. In addition, Ferocious Bite now increases in potency with greater attack power.

 *  [Rip]: Lesser potency Rips will no longer overwrite greater potency ones.

 *  [Growl] now correctly initiates combat when used by a pet in passive mode.

 *  [Frostbite]: The effect of this talent will now still be placed on the victim if the caster is killed before their spell reaches the target.

 * Reduced the number of messages that appear in the combat log when using [Combustion].
 *  [Winter's Chill]: The effect of this talent will now still be placed on the victim if the caster is killed before their spell reaches the target.

 *  [Sap]: Enemy rogues will now always lose stealth when you Sap them.

SHAMAN

 *  [Reincarnation] should now display the cooldown timer when used.
 *  [Chain Heal] - After the initial target is healed, the healing effect will jump to the most damaged target (by absolute health) within range. In addition, if a raid member is the initial target it will look for valid raid targets to jump to rather than non-raid targets as a priority, making it consistent with group targeted Chain Heals.

 *  [Life Tap]: This spell now benefits from effects which increase your spell damage. At rank 3 and above, the base amount of health lost and mana gained will increase by 80% of your bonus spell damage effects. Talents and items can further modify those values. Rank 1 and 2 receive reduced effect.

WARRIORS

 *  [Bloodthirst]: This ability will now correctly benefit from attack power bonuses versus specific creature types.

 *  [Shield Slam]: This ability will sometimes no longer remove more than one beneficial effect from the target.

ITEMS

 *  [Blade of Eternal Darkness]: The triggered effect from this weapon will no longer occur when the spell being cast has its effect broken by causing damage.
 *  [Blazefury Medallion]: The triggered effect from this item will no longer break [Gouge].

 *  [Eye of the Dead]: [Holy Shock] now interacts properly with this item.
 * Ranged Elemental Damage: Our ranged combat system does not allow a ranged weapon to do a mix of Elemental (Fire, Frost, Arcane, etc.) and Physical damage. Many ranged weapons existed which were listed as doing Elemental damage and did not function properly (the damage was dealt, but was treated as Physical). All of those weapons have been changed to deliver the Elemental damage as a chance on hit effect. [Hurricane] was previously changed this way in 1.11. The following ranged weapons are also fixed in 1.12: [Bow of Searing Arrows], [Dwarven Hand Cannon], [Heartseeking Crossbow], [Dark Iron Rifle], [Galgann's Fireblaster], [Quillshooter], [Shell Launcher Shotgun], [Venomstrike], and [Verdant Keeper's Aim].

 * Fixed a bug with the [Jom Gabbar] trinket which was causing it to trigger a category cooldown for a duration longer than intended.
 *  [Wrath of Cenarius]: This item will now trigger from [Arcane Missiles].
 * Clarified the tooltips for the Stormshroud armor and [Kalimdor's Revenge] to explain that they deal Nature damage.
 * Fixed a bug that caused the [Blooddrenched Mask] to hide a character's hair.
 *  [Warbear Leather] now stacks to 20.
 *  [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] may now be equipped in either hand.

 * The cooldown timer on transforming [Anathema] and [Benediction] may no longer be circumvented by zoning or logging out.

 * Engineering: Explosive sheep do fire damage instead of physical damage.

UNDOCUMENTED CHANGES (COMPARED TO THE TEST REALM PATCH NOTES)

Source: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-realm-test&t=304238


 

BATTLEGROUNDS

 * In order to whisper a player from another server in your battleground you must append "-Servername" to the end of their name. These whispers will not show up on your screen, but will show up on theirs.
 * Conjured items are the only type of items that can be traded to players from another server (anything else will give an error message).
 * When you join a battleground, you are automatically added to a raid group. You MAY NOT leave that group. To speak in this raid, use /bg instead of /ra.
 * Leadership of the battleground raid is granted to whomever has the highest PvP rank when the raid is formed (approximately 1 minute before the battleground starts).
 * You may be in a battleground group and a regular group at once, but the battleground group will be the one you see in the party frame as well as the raid tab.
 * The mini-battlemap in will reopen automatically if closed. (This is likely a bug)

WORLD PVP

 * Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands both now have battlemaps like battlegrounds do.

HONOR SYSTEM

Nethaera (Blizzard Poster)


 * The curve has been adjusted to allow more people into the ranks. No, I can't give specific details on how many where but it should help at least for now.

ROGUE

 * Ruthlessness still appears as a Improved Relentless Strikes pre-req but this is just a graphic bug.
 * Murder is now only increased damage to Humanoids but by 2/4% instead of 1/2%. (This is a bug [1])
 * Expose Armor is now a non-ranked ability and the armor reductions are by % ([2] -- Can someone test whether this still replaces sunder armor or if it now stacks?) -- TESTED: Expose Armor not stacking with and still replaces sunder armor.

HUNTER

 * Solenor the Slayer's Soul Flame buff can now be correctly removed.


 

WARLOCK

 * Succubus and Voidwalker now speak when summoned.
 * The trick of Demonology specced Warlock Engineers using Jumper Cables to resurrect a pet that's been Demonic Sacrificed, thereby giving both buffs, has been removed. The buff from Demonic Sacrifice now vanishes whenever you have a pet active regardless of how that pet got (back) into the world.

ITEMS

 * The eating/drinking buffs are removed once you reach full hp or mana. This has the unfortunate side effect of making you unable to get the food buffs that require you to eat for 15 seconds if you are at full hp. This is probably somewhat bugged. (This is a bug [3])

INTERFACE

 * The interface options dialog is now full-screen and opaque meaning it can no longer be used while moving.
 * Raid boss emotes are now shown in center of screen like a warning.
 * Target of Target can be set to show/hide depending on if you're in a group/raid or not.

API CHANGES

From 1. Upcoming 1.12 changes - Concise List | 7/11/2006 6:33:26 PM PDT by Iriel:


This is a consolidated list of the announced (and sometimes observed) changes in the User Interface API's and functionality for the 1.12 patch. Please note that this thread is to discuss the upcoming changes and any clarifications or features that are a direct result of those changes, or things which we've been asked to remind slouken of.


IMPORTANT: Off-topic or entirely redundant posts are liable to get deleted. It is however in everyone's best interest to not post them in the first place - We'd rather slouken could spend his time coding us cool things than moderating this thread!

XML

 * Added Color and BorderColor elements to the XML for backdrops.

COMMUNICATIONS

 * There will be a new SendAddonMessage("prefix", "text", "PARTY|RAID|GUILD") method that transmits a 'hidden' message to the appropriate group of recipients as the normal SendChatMessage would have been.
 * Messages will be delivered as a new CHAT_MSG_ADDON event, with arg1 the prefix, arg2 message, arg3 the distribution type ("PARTY","RAID", "GUILD", "BATTLEGROUND"), and arg4 the sender.
 * The combined length of message plus prefix can be at most 254 characters. The prefix must not contain a tab character.
 * The message will be unaffected by inebriation, but otherwise is subject to normal channel rules (no \n or bad links).
 * (RELEASE - Not on PTR) Messages sent to "RAID" when not in a raid will be delivered as if it had been sent as a "PARTY" message.
 * (RELEASE - Not on PTR) The "BATTLEGROUND" will also be valid as a destination for use with the auto-raid that's formed in battleground, but only in the release build.
 * Using "RAID" or "PARTY" when not in a party or raid sends no message.

INSPECT

 * The inspect distance will be approximately double its current value.
 * The SetInventoryItem method will also respect the correct interact distance limit.

EVENTS

 * RAID_ROSTER_UPDATE will not be sent if you're not in a raid when entering the world.

UNIT FUNCTIONS

 * (RELEASE - Not on PTR) New UnitPlayerOrPetInParty("unit") - Returns 1 if the specified unit is a member of the player's party, or is the pet of a member of the player's party, nil otherwise (Returns 1 for "player" and "pet")
 * (RELEASE - Not on PTR) New UnitPlayerOrPetInRaid("unit") - Returns 1 if the specified unit is a member of the player's raid, or is the pet of a member of the player's raid, nil otherwise (Returns 1 for "player" and "pet")

WARRIORS

 * Canceling [Bloodrage] while in PvP or dueling will no longer remove you from combat.

ITEMS

 *  MAJOR CHANGES
   HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
   
   The holidays are here and the citizens of Azeroth are celebrating the occasion with festive decorations and winter time activities. Keep an eye out for some fun and exciting surprises throughout the world!
   
   NEW DUNGEON - MARAUDON
   
   In the vast gray of Desolace lies the earthen tomb of Zaetar, fallen Keeper of the Grove and son of Cenarius. Zaetar rejected his Keeper heritage when he joined with the princess of the chaotic earth elementals, Theradras. Their unholy union gave birth to the misshapen and cursed centaur, who promptly slew their father for his part in their misbegotten creation. Fearful of Cenarius' wrath, the grief-stricken Theradras sequestered her dead lover's body in her secret sanctuary, the Crystal Caverns of Terramok, where she watches over him to this day. Travelers who come to Desolace have little trouble spotting Zaetar's tomb, for the blessing of nature that permeates his being transformed his resting place into a verdant paradise of flora and tranquil pools. Today, this tomb is now trodden by the hooves of Zaetar's children, who have claimed this great cavern as their sacred stronghold Maraudon.
   
   
   Maraudon, a level 40-49 dungeon in Desolace, is now open and ready for business
   
   CLOAK & HELM GRAPHICS
   
   There are now interface options that let you not display your helm and/or cloak on your character. These options will allow a player to wear a cloak or helm, but not have it show up in the game world. The check boxes to control this functionality are in the Options menu under "Interface Options."
   
   GENERAL CHANGES
   GENERAL
   
    * Players will now receive credit for killing a monster even if they die during battle.
    * Players will now be able to purchase and train mounts from other races in their faction. However, you will first need to obtain "Exalted" reputation status with that race in order to do so. Mounts of the opposing faction are not available for purchase.
    * A "Looking for Group" channel has been added. Additional improvements in looking for group functionality will be added in future patches.
    * Daze chance has been reduced in degrees depending on the level of the monster versus the level of the player. Thus, a monster will have a better chance to Daze a player equal in level than it would Dazing a player five levels higher.
    * If you die in Molten Core, you will now be able to retrieve your corpse at the Blackrock Depths instance line.
    * Several instance bosses and sub-bosses have had their levels slightly lowered.

    * Amount of threat generated by [Shield Bash] when [Shield Discipline] is active has been increased.

   PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER
   
    * Gurubashi Arena - The arena in Stranglethorn Vale has been changed so that free-for-all PvP will only take place on the floor of the arena, and no longer in the stands or on the entrance ramp. Please keep in mind that on PvP realms, members of the opposite faction can still attack you anywhere in the arena because Stranglethorn Vale is a contested area.
    * There is now a short countdown before a duel starts.

    * Many Stranglethorn Vale quests had their experience rewards changed to be more in line with the difficulty of the quests. Some Stranglethorn Vale quests were also increased in difficulty, due to increased kill requirements or balance changes to the quest target creatures.

   BUG FIXES
   
    * A bug with bandages has been fixed. Previously, only the lowest rank bandage ( [Linen Bandage]) was working correctly in that it brought up a channeling bar and required you to remain still while bandaging. All of the other bandage types (Heavy Linen through Heavy Runecloth) were working incorrectly, but have been fixed to operate the same way that Linen Bandages do.
    * Cenarion Vindicators no longer summon Forces of Nature as quickly.
    * Severed Dreamers no longer summon Nightmares as quickly.

    * The Emerald Dragon Whelp will assist you when summoned.
    * Aquatic creatures will no longer eventually teleport to you if you harass them from land.
    * Undead players will no longer be invisible when they first log in after watching the intro cinematic.
    * Fixed the rotating animations of the crystals in Un'Goro Crater.
    * Reginald Windsor's yell can be heard during [60R] The Great Masquerade.
    * Kodos in the Barrens will no longer stomp incessantly while in combat.
    * The Ward of Laze is now summoned at a more appropriate level, instead of level one.

    * Rare creatures in many of the higher level outdoor zones will now use their appropriate combat abilities.
    * Autoloot has been fixed to work with skinning.

    * Rolling for items in the French and German will now work properly.
    * Resolved an issue with looting in click to move mode that could cause crashes.
    * Performance issues occurring with certain CPUs have been resolved.
   
   


 *  PALADIN
   Seal of the Crusader: Fixed a bug where damage per swing was increasing instead of decreasing when Seal of the Crusader was active.This resulted in a dramatic increase in damage per second (DPS) that was unintended. The tooltip for the spell displays the intent of the spell: "Fills the Paladin with the spirit of a crusader, granting additional attack power. The Paladin also attacks faster, but deals less damage with each attack." The overall increase in DPS from Seal of the Crusader should only result from the increase in attack power and not from the increase in attack speed. We understand this is a significant decrease in the power of this spell, but was a necessary bug fix to ensure both overall game balance and the viability of different Paladin Seals. LOCALIZATION
   
    * Various text strings and audio have been corrected for the French and German versions of the game.
   
   MACS
   
    * Fixed a bug that incorrectly enabled the vertex animation shader option on some GPU's that do not support it. This bug was causing player character models in-game and in the character selection screen to appear invisible or distorted. The fix should benefit users with NVIDIA GeForce 2MX or 4MX GPU's and ATI Radeon 7000/7500 GPU's. It should no longer be necessary to manually turn off the vertex animation feature on these systems * it should now be off and disabled automatically.
   
   BUG FIXES
   
    * Group loot has been fixed to work as originally intended. It will now work exactly like round robin does, with the exception that when an item of threshold level or above drops, it will use the auto-rolling system. (Prior to this fix, when in group loot mode, the round robin system was only being used for items (all players could loot coins), which was rather confusing).
    * Fixed a group loot permission bug that was telling players they did not have permission to loot.
    * Fixed a bug that was causing the game to freeze when scrolling through auctions in the Auction House.
    * Murlocs play the drown animation when they die underwater now.
    * Onyxia correctly hovers instead of standing in midair.
    * You can target vocal emotes again.
    * Pets and summoned creatures attacking enemies will now tap the enemies for their owners.

   ADDENDA
   
    * These changes were made after the publication of the patch notes and thus could not be added to the in-game patch notes. 
       * Hunter and Warlock pets will now correctly "tap" the targets they attack, thus giving the pet owner kill credit for a target even if another player later attacks the same target.
       * The tooltip for the Warrior's Intercept ability has been updated to reflect the proper rage cost. Using Intercept costs 10 rage, not 15 rage. The tooltip now accurately reflects that.

    * Dueling across factions remains intact in the patch, in consideration of players' desires to duel members of the opposing faction.
   
   


 *  BUG FIXES
   
    * We have deployed a client-side change that should improve performance when large numbers of players are gathered in a small area of the world. No other changes are included with this emergency patch.
   
   


 *  UPDATED CHANGES
   
    * Players who have completed the Molten Core discovery quest can now port directly to the zone, bypassing Blackrock Depths.

    * Various Bind on Pickup items that were previously of common quality (white) have been changed to green (ie: Corruptor's Scourgestone).

   MAJOR CHANGES
   DIREMAUL
   
   Diremaul, a new dungeon for players level 56-60, is now open and ready for business. Diremaul is populated by a fierce tribe of ogres and is located in the western region of Feralas. Diremaul will be limited groups of no more than five players each.
   
   NEW OUTDOOR RAID BOSSES
   
   Two new outdoor raid bosses have been introduced to Azeroth. Azuregos, a monstrous blue dragon, has landed in Azshara, while Lord Kazzak the demon can be found in the Tainted Scar of the Blasted Lands.
   
   MEETING STONES
   
   Meeting Stones are located outside of each dungeon to help players find a group to adventure with in the dungeon. The meeting stone will try to find you a viable five-person group by looking for a tank, a healer, and so on. As time passes and you are unable to find a group, the meeting stone will become less picky about who it groups you with.
   
   DUNGEON PLAYER CAPS
   
   All dungeons now have a cap on group size to limit the number of players that may enter the dungeon. It was necessary to add this cap as raiding these dungeons trivialized much of the content. Because of this change we can now look to adding better loot to them during future content patches.
   
   
   With that in mind, the dungeons below now have the following caps:
   
   
    * Onyxia/Molten Core - 40 members
    * Blackrock Spire - 15 members
    * Diremaul - 5 members
   
   
   All other dungeons in the game will be capped at 10 members.Several dungeons will be re-examined for balancing in light of this change. In addition, will have their loot improved significatnly for the next content patch.
   
   GENERAL CHANGES
   
   (detailed information for each below)
   
   GENERAL
   
    * Previously, in many cases, a Block, Parry, or Dodge was translated into a "Miss," thus causing confusion over actual miss rates. We've made the following changes in an attempt to be more clear as to what is actually happening in combat: 
       * Block: All creatures will now report a Block on attacks from the front, reducing damage caused instead of converting the attack into a "Miss." Creatures will no longer be able to Block attacks from behind.
       * Dodge: Every time a creature Dodges, it will report a Dodge. We will no longer translate a creature's Dodge of a rear attack to a "Miss."
       * Parry: All creatures will now report a Parry on attacks from the front instead of translating them into a "Miss." Creatures will no longer be able to Parry attacks from behind.
      
      
    * Blocking an ability that takes place on the next swing now blocks the normal amount of damage instead of all of it.
    * Skill-up rate improved for bows, crossbows, guns, thrown, and wands.
    * Improved line of sight for large creatures.
    * In-game mail sent from GMs will now use official Blizzard stationery.
    * The Drunk effect has been greatly enhanced.
    * If you resurrect without releasing your spirit, your resurrection timer will decrease normally.
    * You can no longer accept a warlock summoning while you are in combat.
    * Increased stun resistance will now also help resist some non-melee based stun spells from creatures.
    * Mounts now are Horde or Alliance restricted in the tooltip. We do not intend to allow Horde players to ride Alliance vendor-purchased mounts and vice versa.
   
   PVP
   
    * Numbers and punctuation will not be passed through chat communication to members of the opposing faction.
    * Spells in PvP now have a slight increase in range and area of effect when targets are moving. This should improve the overall usability of spells and ranged attacks.
    * Priests can no longer kill players with Shadow Word: Pain and Mind Control in duels.
    * Certain key NPCs (such as bankers and auctioneers) in the cities and main outposts are now harder to kill. Additionally, when they die, they will respawn more quickly.
    * Patrolling scouts that can see through stealth and invisibility have been added to both Orgrimmar and Ironforge.
    * Players under Mind Control pass reputation changes due to kills to the controlling player, and do not receive the reputation changes themselves.
    * You cannot see your enemies' buffs while you are charmed.
    * Dueling players can now cast helpful spells on their allies (but not vice versa).

    *  [Cat Form] - DPS increase at levels 40-60.

    * New Spell: [Barkskin] (available at level 44) - The druid's skin becomes as tough as bark. Physical damage taken is reduced. While protected, taking damage will not cause spellcasting delays, but non-instant spells take longer to cast and melee combat is slowed.
    * New Ability (Bear Form): [Frenzied Regeneration] (available at level 36) - Converts an amount of rage into health every second for a short duration.
   
   HUNTER
   
    * Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was decreased.
    * Sandfury Guardians are no longer tameable.
    * Fixed a bug where Hunter pets were sometimes unattackable by opposing faction players.

    *  [Improved Blizzard] - Chill duration reduced to 1.5 seconds (4.5 seconds w/ [Permafrost]) and refreshes with each damage tick rather than at the beginning of the spell. In addition, a target that resists the damage will also resist the chill effect.

    * Blink can now be used to escape more of the stun effects used by creatures in the world.
    * Blink is no longer usable on boats or zeppelins.

    * New Spell: [Conjure Water] (Rank 7) (Available through quest at level 60).
    *  [Arcane Missiles]: Fixed a bug where the spell would not function properly against spell-reflecting targets.

    *  [Power Word: Shield] - Now castable on all raid targets.
   
   ROGUE
   
    * A number of areas in the world now have footlockers in them. These areas are in place for rogues to visit to increase their lockpicking skills. The contents of these footlockers are only token amounts of treasure, but they should allow for a more interesting experience while increasing lockpicking skill. The difficulty of the locks in the area correspond to the level of the zone, so if your lockpicking skill is around 100, you would go to Durnholde Keep in Hillsbrad. But if your skill is 250, you might head to Tyr's Hand in Eastern Plaguelands. 
       * Hillsbrad Foothills - Durnholde Keep
       * Redridge Mountains - Lake Everstill
       * Ashenvale Forest - Zoram Strand
       * Stonetalon Mountains - Windshear Crag and Associated Mines

    * Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was decreased.

    *  [Astral Recall] - The tooltip now includes the home point the spell will recall you to.

The Infernal will now immediately attack targets within the radius of the spell.
    *  [Enslave Demon] - Is no longer dispellable.
    * Curse of Agony - Now benefits from items that increase shadow damage.
    * Nightfall - Fixed a bug where the Shadow Trance effect was lost without benefit. Previously, the talent had a 3%/4% chance of triggering. It now has a 2%/4% chance of triggering, and the tooltips have been updated to accurately reflect this change.
    *  [Ritual of Doom] - The death caused at the completion of the ritual no longer causes durability loss.

    * Warbringer Constructs now have less armor than before.

   GURUBASHI ARENA EVENT

   ELEMENTAL INVASIONS!
   
   Invasions by elementals at different locations on Kalimdor have reportedly been occurring sporadically every few days. Concerned adventurers should investigate Silithus, Un'Goro Crater, Azshara, and Winterspring to counter these incursions.
   
   DETAILS
   GENERAL
   
    * Charm and [Polymorph] mechanics can now be reactively countered by spells and abilities (e.g. Druid Shapeshifting will now cancel Polymorph effects).
    * Mana regeneration is now disrupted when a spell has completed casting rather than at the start of casting. It will resume normally five seconds after the last spell cast. This change increases the total time spent regenerating mana and therefore increases the total contribution from Spirit for mana-based classes.
    * Level 60 mounts purchased at vendors now have a whole new look. Faster undead mounts already have a different look and so have not changed. The new mounts can be seen standing near the mount vendors. If you have one of the old fast mounts, you can exchange it for one with a new look at the mount vendor.
    * Healing-over-time spells should now be improved by "+Healing" items when cast on other players.
    * Mind Controlled characters will no longer receive a durability penalty when they die.
    * When a non-Hunter resurrects a pet, the pet will no longer receive resurrection sickness.
   
   PVP
   
    * A handful of spells were added to the list of spells subject to diminishing returns in PvP. It is our goal to set as few spells as possible to be diminished. We've identified this short list of spells as having durations and cooldowns sufficient to almost permanently slow or immobilize targets but without adequate controls or other limiting factors. When a spell with diminishing returns is used against a target in PvP, the first effect has full duration. On the second use of the same category of spell (e.g. slowing), that spell's duration is reduced by 50%. On the third use, the duration is reduced by 75%. On the fourth attempt, the target becomes immune to the spell. Spells must be used on the same target within 15 seconds of the *end* of the duration in order to be diminished. In other words, if a target hasn't had a slowing spell active on them for more than 15 seconds, the next slowing spell will have full effect. The list of affected spells is: 
       *  [Frost Shock]
       *  [Entangling Roots]
       *  [Frost Nova]
      
      
    * Guard directions, signs and signposts have been added to point you toward the PvP Officer Lounges in Stormwind City (Champions' Hall) and Orgrimmar (Hall of Legends).
   
   RACIAL TRAITS

    *  [Viper Sting] - This spell can no longer be used on warrior and rogue targets. In addition, while it can be used on a druid target at any time it will only drain mana when the druid is in caster form.
   
   MAGES
   
    *  [Amplify Magic] and [Dampen Magic] effects should now replace each other properly.
    *  [Improved Scorch] (Talent) - Redesign. Scorch spells have a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to cause your target to be vulnerable to Fire damage. This vulnerability increases the Fire damage dealt to your target by 2% and can be stacked up to 5 times for a total of 10% increased Fire damage.
    * New Spell: [Arcane Brilliance] (available at level 56 - Loot) - Infuses the target's party with brilliance, increasing their Intellect.
    *  [Improved Mana Shield] - Design changed. Instead of increasing the amount absorbed, it now decreases the mana lost per point of damage taken by 10/20%.
    * An error message is now displayed if you try to use [Blink] on boats and zeppelins.
    *  [Wand Specialization] - Fixed a bug where the damage increase with this talent was higher than the listed amount.

    * Paladin Epic Mount quest added. To begin, talk to the paladin trainers Duthroian Rall or Brandur Ironhammer.
    * Paladins who have completed their Epic Mount quest can repeat the final event in Scholomance for fun (and loot) by speaking with Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker.

    * Resistance Auras - Paladins should now be able to switch from a resistance aura to any other resistance aura without canceling the current one first.
    *  [Improved Seal of Justice] - Fixed a bug that caused the talent to have no effect. It will now increase the frequency that the stun effect will land.

    * A new Priest epic quest series is now in the game and waiting to be found.
    *  [Levitate] - Duration and mana cost increased.
    *  [Touch of Weakness] - Should now be affected by the [Blackout], [Darkness], [Force of Will], [Shadow Focus], [Shadow Weaving] and [Silent Resolve] talents.
    *  [Starshards] - Should now be affected by the [Focused Casting], [Force of Will], and [Silent Resolve] talents.
    *  [Holy Fire] - Should now be affected by the [Focused Casting] talent.
    *  [Mind Flay] - Should now be affected by the [Focused Casting] talent.
    *  [Desperate Prayer] - Should now be affected by the Holy Specialization talents.
    *  [Vampiric Embrace] - Active icon tooltip rewritten to be more clear.
    *  [Holy Nova] - Now causes an explosion of holy light around the caster, causing Holy damage to all enemy targets within 10 yards and healing all party members within 10 yards. These effects now cause no threat as opposed to reducing threat temporarily.
    *  [Holy Fire] - Several changes were made to Holy Fire in an effort to make this a more usable and efficient damage spell. The cast time was reduced from five seconds to four seconds, which reduces the damage caused. Therefore, the damage was increased and more of the spell's potency was shifted into the damage-over-time portion. The duration was also increased and mana cost and cooldown were both decreased. While the direct damage portion was reduced slightly from the previous version, each tick of damage should be unchanged, and the spell now delivers one additional tick of damage. In total, the relative damage and efficiency of the spell has been increased.
    *  [Wand Specialization] - Fixed a bug where the damage increase with this talent was too high.
   
   ROGUES
   
    * Combo points will no longer be removed if the target is deselected. They will only be removed if a different target is selected.
    * Fixed a bug where combo points were not always being applied to the target when using [Cheap Shot], [Ambush] and [Garrote].
    *  [Vanish] - Increased stealth bonus.
    *  [Ambush], [Backstab], [Ghostly Strike], and [Riposte] now properly increase the attack power contribution by the percent modifier. Our goal is to make the dagger-based Backstab/Ambush build a viable alternative to the sword/mace-based [Sinister Strike] build. As a side effect, fixing this bug also increased maximum critical Ambush damage beyond our intentions. After considering a variety of balance changes (including reducing the percent modifier or base damage of Ambush, or reducing the [Improved Ambush] talents) we decided to change the [Lethality] talent to no longer affect Ambush. This does not counteract the DPS increase from the bug fix as Backstab is the primary source of DPS while Ambush is a source of high, one-time damage and cannot be used as consistent DPS. After all balance changes are considered, here are some details:
      (Using a [Barman Shanker] with 2.0 weapon speed and between 500 and 800 attack power) 
       * Ambush without the [Lethality] bonus and attack power bug fix (patch 1.4.0) causes between 4-12% more damage than --- • Ambush with the [Lethality] bonus and attack power bug (patch 1.3.1).
       *  [Backstab] (patch 1.4.0) causes between 9-13% more damage than Backstab (1.3.1).
      
      
    * The [Kick] ability prevents the target from casting spells in the same school when channeled casting is interrupted.
    * If using [Gouge] triggers the Stormshroud Armor lightning effect, the Gouge effect will no longer be instantly interrupted.
    * The Rogue trainers will now point the player to an appropriate area with boxes to unlock depending on the lockpicking skill of the player.
    *  [Preparation] - Will now clear the cooldown of the [Blade Flurry] ability.
    *  [Riposte] - Fixed a bug that prevented the ability from being used when the target had no weapon or was already disarmed.
   
   SHAMAN
   
    *  [Earth Shock] - The visual for ranks two through seven has been changed to be consistent with rank one.
    *  [Windfury] - Fixed a bug that caused an additional attack beyond what was intended. In addition, fixed a bug that caused the next normal melee attack to happen sooner than intended.
    * Level 58+ Shaman should talk to Sagorne Creststrider in Orgrimmar; there is a special quest for them involving a dreaded death knight who dwells in the depths of the Scholomance.
    *  [Frost Shock] - Now subject to diminishing returns in PvP. This is considered a slowing effect.
    *  [Grounding Totem] - Should no longer redirect area effect spells or be destroyed by area effects spells.
   
   WARLOCKS

   WARRIORS
   
    *  [Thunder Clap] - Visual and animation changed.
   
   ITEMS
   
    * The following set items have had their art updated: 
       *  [Devout Crown] and Mantle, [Magister's Crown], [Circlet of Prophecy], all parts of the Warrior "Might" set, [Lightforge Helm], [Helm of Valor], [Dreadmist Mask], [Wildheart Cowl] and Pauldrons, and [Coif of Elements]. Other class sets will receive updated art in future patches.
      
      
    * Random world items that had increased healing effects were mislabeled, and the amount of increased healing appeared to be half of what was actually occurring. The amount shown on the item is now an accurate representation of the healing increase.
    * The Celestial Orb and Robe of the Archmage will no longer trigger the cooldowns of a Mage's mana gems. Mana gems are now on their own unique cooldown category.
    * Tiny Black Whelping item changed to [Dark Whelpling] to reflect the name of the creature summoned.
    * Fixed a typo in the aura description for the Mighty Rage potion.

    * Onyxia Hide Backpacks are now 18 slot containers.
    *  [Warstrike Shoulder Pads] have been improved.
    *  [Living Leggings], Breastplate, and Shoulders now have Stamina, but had their Nature Resistance lowered.

    * Target Dummies now generate an initial taunt pulse so creatures will attack them for the first 5 seconds after they are dropped.
    *  [Gnomish Death Ray] damage increased slightly and cooldown reduced to 5 minutes.
    * The level of the Mechanical Dragonlings, Battlechicken, and Bombs dropped by the Goblin Bomb Dropper now scale with your engineering skill, so they will be always useful against enemies. Their damage and health has remained the same.
    * Requirements to make the [Helm of Fire] were reduced.
   
   RAIDS & DUNGEONS
   
    * Azuregos now has a new ability - Mark of Frost. A player who is hit with the Mark of Frost will be temporarily frozen in a block of ice should they attempt to re-engage Azuregos. Mark of Frost is extremely powerful and will persist through death and resurrection.
    * Bael'Gar, Lord Incendius, and Golem Lord Argelmach are now slightly lower level than previously. This will provide a much better progression of creature and boss levels in Blackrock Depths.
    * The Baroness Anastari encounter has been changed. Players who become unpossessed will now have full health, and after the Baroness unpossesses a player there will be a much longer cooldown before she can cast possess again. These changes should make her a more balanced encounter for a 5 man group.
    * Lava Surgers no longer respawn once you kill Garr.
    * When Majordomo Executus submits, a chest is spawned next to him. This chest should only spawn the FIRST time he is defeated in a saved instance. If a guild tries him a second or third night, no chest should spawn.

       * Onyxia will once again drop two upper tier class set helms.
       * Most of the non-class set items that dropped from Molten Core and Onyxia have had their effective levels increased, resulting in higher DPS weapons, and/or better stats and effects.

       * The loot tables for some of the Molten Core bosses have been improved so they drop an additional epic item per kill.
       * World bosses such as Onyxia, Azuregos, and Lord Kazzak will no longer drop random blue items of a level lower than 50.
       * Prior to this patch, Molten Core boss creatures could drop items from one of two different tiered sets for every character class. The loot tables have been changed so Molten Core bosses will now only drop items from the lower tier class sets. However, some of the items from those sets were not previously dropping in Molten Core. These missing class set items will now drop in Molten Core, allowing players to complete their lower tier class sets. The higher tier class set pieces that once dropped in Molten Core will be found once again in Blackwing Lair, the next raiding zone scheduled for release in a future patch.
       * Future patches will include even more item rewards for these raid encounters, as well as improvements to the statistics, effects, and set bonuses for both tiers of the raid armor sets.
      
      
   
   QUESTS
   
    * Party quest share information is now working.

Located in each of the cities, right-clicking on a battlemaster will allow your character to enter a battleground queue just like you normally would if you touched that battleground's entrance portal.

Likewise you can drag a group name to your playfield to have the players in that group displayed on your gamefield. In either case the display will show the health, mana and limited buffs or debuffs on each player in the group or class and you can click on a player listed this way to target that player. You can then right-click on the class or group UI element to make some modifications to how the UI displays or to remove the UI element.
    * If you cycle through targets with the Tab key, manually select a different target using another method, then quickly hit Tab again, your last Tab-selected target will be re-selected and you can continue Tab-selecting where you left off.

    * Graveyards 
       * Feralas, Durotar, Mulgore, Darnassus, Tirisfal Glades (excluding the Bulwark graveyard), Elwynn Forest & the Eastern Plaguelands have now all been converted over to the new graveyard system. The system will place your character's spirit at the closest allowed graveyard in the zone. For example, an Alliance character dying closer to the new Darnassus graveyard, detailed below, will use that graveyard rather than the one located at Dolanaar. Starting area graveyards are still reserved exclusively for characters of similar faction that die within their confines. For example, the spirit of a Horde character dying right outside of Deathknell will not use Deathknell graveyard, but will instead go to the next closest Tirisfal Glades graveyard.
       * A Horde-only graveyard has been added in the northern section of Durotar, just to the south of Orgrimmar.

       * A Horde-only graveyard has been placed at the northern base of Thunder Bluff in Mulgore. Horde characters dying in Thunder Bluff will also use this new graveyard. Alliance characters dying in Mulgore will continue to only use the graveyard at Bloodhoof Village.

       * An Alliance-only graveyard has been added just outside of Ironforge, around the side of the mountain. It is only for use by Alliance characters that die inside Ironforge and in the Gates of Ironforge sub-area of Dun Morogh. Horde characters dying therein will continue to only use the Kharanos graveyard.
       * The Ruins of Lordaeron above Undercity now has a Horde-only graveyard. Horde characters dying inside the Undercity will use this new graveyard. Alliance characters will continue to solely use the Faol's Rest graveyard.
       * A neutral graveyard has been added at the Eastvale Logging Camp in Elwynn Forest. The graveyard at Goldshire is now for use by the Alliance exclusively. Horde characters dying in Elwynn Forest and its sub-areas, as well as in Stormwind, The Stockade and the Deeprun Tram, will have their spirits travel to the new graveyard at the Eastvale Logging Camp.
       * A neutral graveyard has been added on the island of Caer Darrow in Western Plaguelands. It will serve characters who die on Caer Darrow and in Scholomance.
       * A neutral graveyard has been added in the Eastern Plaguelands near the northwestern shore of Blackwood Lake. Characters that die in The Fungal Vale will continue to use the Darrowshire graveyard due to the mountains between it and the new graveyard. Additionally, characters dying in Stratholme will now use the new Blackwood Lake graveyard.
       * A neutral graveyard has been added in Feralas, just to the southwest of Dire Maul. Characters dying in Dire Maul will use this new graveyard.
      
      
    * Darkmoon Cards have been seen dropping from high level Humanoids around the world. Collect a set of them and bring them to the Darkmoon Faire when it is in town!

DETAILS
   GENERAL
   
    * Instant Attacks
   
   The mechanics of most instant melee attacks have been modified to improve item balance. Previously, instant melee attacks did damage based on the damage range of the weapon, plus a bonus for the player's attack power. This bonus was then multiplied by the speed of the weapon. As a result, slow weapons did more damage than was intended, and fast weapons were considered inferior by most players. We have changed the way the attack power bonus is calculated for instant attacks. This change does NOT affect attack power calculations for normal melee attacks. Instead of multiplying by the speed of the weapon, the attack power bonus is now multiplied by a fixed number pulled from the following table: 
    * Two-handed weapons: 3.3
    * Daggers: 1.7
    * All other one-handed weapons: 2.4
   
   As a direct result of this, many weapons have shifted position in their relative power. In particular, many Epic (purple) quality items are now more powerful than slower Superior (blue) weapons. This change was not made to reduce the power of instant attacks, but to correct the relative imbalance of weapon itemization. At a given level requirement, epic quality weapons should always be more powerful than superior quality weapons. Please also note that all normal weapon swings will be completely unaffected by this change. The following abilities are affected by the design change: [Sinister Strike], [Ambush], [Backstab], [Whirlwind], [Mortal Strike], and [Overpower]. 
    * The cost per point of durability to repair plate, chain, and leather items has been reduced to be equal to the cost of repairing cloth items of the same quality.
    * You can now repurchase up to 12 items that you have sold to a vendor. There is now a buyback tab on all merchants that you can select to repurchase the last 12 items you sold since you last logged in. When your character leaves the game or zones to a different area, this list of items will be cleared, so if you have accidentally sold something, don't wait to buy it back. Buy it back immediately.
    *  [Perception] (Human Racial) is now usable while stealthed.
    * Guardians and pets in aggressive mode no longer attack civilians.
    * There is now a spell effect when you increase your reputation to a new level.
    * Channeled spells that are cancelled by movement can no longer be cast while moving.
    * Pets no longer break off attacks when their target is affected by Warlock [Fear].
    * The "Knockout" mechanic has been renamed "Disorient" and all tooltips that referenced this mechanic should be updated.
   
   PVP
   
    * Honor system 
       * The percentage of players that may reach ranks 6 through 14 has been increased.
       * Lower-level players should advance in the Honor System more quickly than they had previously (although this change does not affect the highest ranks they can achieve).
      
      
    * Battlegrounds 
       * Each Battleground has an individual turn-in quest associated with its related victory/loss condition. Upon completion of a Battleground, the winning side will be awarded three Marks of Honor while the losing side will be awarded one Mark of Honor. Three Marks of Honor may be turned in to the associated questgiver for Honor points and faction increase. Should players complete this turn-in quest, they will find that the bonus Honor Points for completion are twice that of normal turn-in conditions (individual).
       * Players of levels 10 - 19 will now be able to participate in the battle for Warsong Gulch.
       * Alterac Valley has received an overhaul: 
          * In order to keep teams in Alterac Valley more numerically balanced, players will now enter Alterac Valley on a one-for-one basis (i.e. if there are 30 players in the battleground for each side with 10 players in the Alliance queue and 2 players in the Horde queue, only two players from each team will be added, bringing the total to 32 per side).
          * The minimum number of players required to start a battle in Alterac Valley has been lowered to 20 (the maximum is still 40).
          * Points for completing the map and winning have been slightly decreased.
          * Graveyards and graveyard capture points are now at different locations. The banners players must interact with in order to capture a graveyard have been distanced from each other somewhat in order to alleviate "graveyard zerging" and make graveyards more meaningful to both defense and offense.
          * Several terrain changes were made to fix some geometry exploits as well as to adjust for the new graveyard mechanic.
          * Iceblood Graveyard has been fortified.
          * The Frostwolf Relief Hut now has appropriate guards.
          * A great avalanche has closed off both the eastern and western segments of Alterac Valley. This has displaced the Syndicate, the Wildpaw Gnolls, and many of the Winterax Trolls.
          * Due to the avalanche, Korrak the Bloodrager and a small band of surviving Trolls have made the Snowfall Graveyard their new home. Players will find that Snowfall is now under Korrak's control and they must defeat Korrak and his Troll guards if they wish to take Snowfall.
          * The quests Korrak the Bloodrager (Alliance), Korrak the Everliving (Alliance), The Legend of Korrak (Horde), and The Return of Korrak (Horde) have been removed from the game. The rewards for the initial quest involving Korrak have been moved and can be acquired by completing the quest associated with winning a match in Alterac Valley. We realize that some players may have had the Korrak quest and never completed it. These players may have already completed the quest for killing the General and thus might not be able to benefit from the rewards from the previous quest line.

THE GATES OF AHN'QIRAJ

The Gates of Ahn'Qiraj will house two massive, unique dungeons -- the Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj, a 20-man raid dungeon, and the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj, a 40-man raid dungeon. As players delve deeper into the mysteries of Ahn'Qiraj, they will discover revelations of the Silithid infestation and their shadowy masters, the Qiraji. Players will have to complete a world event of massive proportions before they can open the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj on their realm.


During the public test of Ahn'Qiraj, the world event to open the gates will be accelerated to allow testing of the dungeon content.[sic]

LINKED AUCTION HOUSES

Players will now be able to buy and sell goods with greater effectiveness using the Linked Auction House system. Auction Houses in Orgrimmar, Undercity, and Thunder Bluff will now share the same pool of Horde player-created auctions, and Alliance players will find the same to be true when visiting Ironforge, Stormwind City, and Darnassus Auction Houses. This system has been expanded to support the neutral Auction Houses as well. Tanaris, Everlook, and Booty Bay will all be linked for players of both factions to access. In addition, the "Looking for Group" and "Trade" channels have been unified among the corresponding cities, meaning, for example, that you can trade your goods or look for groups in Ironforge while in Stormwind.

MULTIPLE BATTLEGROUNDS QUEUES

Players will be able to enter multiple battleground queues. No longer must you make the hard decision of which queue to join -- when queued for all three, you can join the first one available or hold out for that particular battleground which you've really got your heart set on. Should a queue open while you are already in a battleground, you may switch to the new battle or remain in the current on.

SOUL SHARD BAGS

Tailors now can make soul bags to hold soul shards. The smallest is a 20-slot bag, the recipe for which can be purchased in Gadgetzan. The recipe for a 24-slot bag can be found in Scholomance, and one for an even larger bag can be found in Molten Core. In the main UI, these soul bags will display how many shards they contain. So long as the soul bags have room, any soul shards a warlock creates will automatically go into the bag. The counter on the bag will max out at the number of bag slots even if you have more soul shards in your inventory.

RAID CALENDAR SYSTEM

The raid-lockout system has undergone a significant change. The new system will have all instances reset at a certain server time, regardless of when you were actually saved to the instance. The reset schedule is as follows:


 * Molten Core: Every 7 Days, resetting during weekly maintenance.
 * Blackwing Lair: Every 7 Days, resetting during weekly maintenance
 * Onyxia: Every 5 Days
 * Zul'Gurub: Every 3 Days
 * Temple of Ahn'Qiraj (40-man): Every 7 Days, resetting during weekly maintenance
 * Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj (20-man): Every 3 Days


All resets will occur during off-hours, when the least amount of raids are active.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR MAC OS X USERS

The minimum supported Mac OS X revision for WoW will be changed in a post-1.9.0 patch, from 10.3.5 to 10.3.9. If you are running 10.3.5 - 10.3.8 and need to get the free update, you can use Software Update or you can click here for the direct download. This change will make it easier for us to release future updates to the game, for example to support upcoming Mac models based on Intel processors.

LOOKING FOR GROUP INTERFACE TOOL

A new Looking For Group tool designed to assist players in finding groups for instanced dungeons and quests will now be available. This interface gives players the option to be added to a pool of other players also looking for a group, as a means to expedite the process. In addition, players will also be able to search for additional members in situations where they have a group and are simply looking to find more players. For a complete overview of this new interface, please take a moment and read the information contained on our comprehensive Looking for Group preview.

THE BURNING CRUSADE

Several years have passed since the Burning Legion's defeat at the Battle of Mount Hyjal - and the races of Azeroth have continued to rebuild their once shattered kingdoms. With renewed strength, the heroes of the Horde and Alliance have begun to explore the broken lands beyond the Dark Portal. What dangers or rewards await mortal champions in Draenor? And what will the Alliance and Horde do when they discover that the demons they thought vanquished have returned to renew their terrible Burning Crusade?

GENERAL

 * A stirring of events has begun throughout Azeroth and rumor points to the Dark Portal as its source.

 * The Auction House now sorts by buyout price first, then by current price. This should filter all of the items with outlandish buyout prices to the bottom of the list.
 * Players will now need to be level 58 to pass through the Dark Portal. (The Burning Crusade Expansion must be installed.)
 * Collector Edition pets are now blue items and a confirmation dialogue will appear to prevent accidental deletion.
 * Pets will no longer attack targets that are under the influence of crowd control ( [Polymorph], [Banish], etc.).

UNDOCUMENTED CHANGES

The following is a list of undocumented changes observed by players. They may not be agreed upon by everyone. They are not part of the official Blizzard release notes.


 * Fixed several raid interface bugs
 * Fixed a bug where flags in Alterac Valley could be captured at extremely long distances. (Cannot confirm; rogues can still exploit DBAS)

SUMMARY

 * Increased the maximum number of realms that can be listed in the Realm List.
 * Updated the Terms of Use.
 * Created an option to disable UI Acceleration for users of select video cards experiencing graphical corruption of the User Interface. To utilize this option, enter the following line to the Config.wtf file, located in the WTF subfolder of the game:

Set UIFaster "x"
Where x equals:
   0 - This turns off all UI acceleration
   1 - For Internal Use Only - DO NOT USE!
   2 - Enables partial UI acceleration only.
   3 - Enables all UI acceleration. 
Example:
   Set UIFaster "2"


Note: For users experiencing graphical corruption of the User Interface, it is recommended to try option 2 in order to correct the problem. If this does not solve the issue, then use option 0 to disable all UI acceleration.[1]

PATCH PROBLEMS

Patch 2.0.5 was initially released on the morning of January 14, 2007. However, due to authentication issues, some players were not able to log on. Blizzard altered the servers to allow players with and without the patch to continue play the game. Those who have patched to 2.0.5 may be stranded as there is no rollback procedure for the game client.


The problem stemmed from a change in authentication.[2] Under the new patch, the authentication servers would only allow clients with the Burning Crusade installed, of which publicly, there were none at the time.


Hours later, Blizzard announced that the problem has since been fixed, and that clients 2.0.4 and 2.0.5 could coexist. Patch 2.0.6 was released the following week.

THE BLACK TEMPLE

The Temple of Karabor was the center of draenei worship until its priests were slaughtered by demonically corrupted orcs. In the massacre's aftermath the warlocks of The Shadow Council seized the structure and gave it a new name: The Black Temple.


When The Alliance invaded Draenor after The Second War, the orc shaman Ner'zhul hastily opened several dimensional portals in order to escape. The resulting magical backlash ripped the world apart. Drawn by these portals, the pit lord Magtheridon arrived in what had come to be known as Outland and took the temple as his seat of power.


His dominion over Outland remained unchallenged until the arrival of Illidan the Betrayer. The pit lord proved no match for the wielder of the Twin Blades of Azzinoth. Today Illidan occupies the temple, awaiting any and all who would challenge his rule.

DRUID EPIC FLIGHT FORM INTRODUCED

The Druid Epic flight form will be available through a series of quests, similar to the Warlock and Paladin Epic mount quests before it. This quest series will also open up a new boss in Sethekk Halls, and ultimately lead to the epic flight form.

ETHEREUM PRISON

Players in good standing with the Consortium will be tasked to deal with the most recent activities of the nefarious Ethereum. With new quests, items, and content for the solo and small-group level 70 player, the Ethereum Prison will be the proving grounds for many aspiring to greatness.

SKETTIS

The Skyguard, Sha’tari warriors specializing in their command of the skies above Shattrath, have taken the offensive directly to the Arakkoa capital city, Skettis. Perched high in the mountains of Terokkar, and only accessible with use of a flying mount, Skettis holds new and exciting content for the solo or small-group level 70 player. All new quests, 5-person bosses, rare and epic items, and a new type of flying mount await those willing to lend their sword or stave to the battle.

NETHER DRAKE

The Netherwing faction and quest line continues and the long awaited Nether Drake becomes available. The Nether Drake is a special 280% speed epic flying mount that is obtainable through solo and small-group play. The quest to obtain one will be difficult, but the reward will surely show your dedication to the Netherwing cause as you soar through the skies of Outland on your very own ethereal drake.

OGRI'LA

The ogre plateau of enlightenment opens to those who prove their worth in Blade's Edge Mountains. Level 70 players will be able to help the ogres of Ogri'la battle invading forces and engage in new and exciting quests, such as a repeatable and ever popular bombing-run, this time using your own flying mount but with a dangerous twist! Featuring tons of new quests, the Ogri’la faction, 5-person bosses, and rare and epic items, Ogri’la is a place we’re hoping all will aspire to enter.

THE RUINS OF LORDAERON ARENA

For those combatants engaging in the Steamwheedle Cartel’s gladiatorial combat, an arena nestled within the Ruins of Lordaeron has been added to the mix of venues. Players taking part in either rated battles or skirmishes may now find themselves battling for glory within the new arena.

THE GODS OF ZUL’AMAN

The stronghold of Zul'Aman has stood for millennia as the Amani trolls' seat of power and bastion of the fearless, cunning warlord Zul'jin.


Zul'jin has spent several years plotting behind Zul'Aman's walls. Furious at the Horde for allowing his hated enemies, the blood elves, to join its ranks, he eagerly embraced a scheme that the witch doctor Malacrass recently proposed: to seal the power of the animal gods within the bodies of the Amani's strongest warriors.


Now Zul'Aman's army grows more powerful by the day, hungry to exact vengeance in the name of its fearless leader, Zul'jin.

GUILD BANKS INTRODUCED

The Guild Bank will allow players with the appropriate permissions to store items and money for use by the rest of the guild. Permissions to withdraw and deposit money and items are controlled by the guild leader through the guild controls menu. The Guild Bank is divided up into separate tabs so that the guild leader may restrict access or group items into distinct categories.


 * Up to 6 purchasable tabs each containing 98 item slots (tabs cost 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, and 5000, a total of 9350 for all 6 tabs)

 * Sorting of auction house searches has been simplified so you can only sort by one column, and automatic sub-sorts have been created for those columns to be as useful as possible.

 * When you speak with an NPC with a single function (Banker, Flight Master, Etc) and who has no other gossip options or quests you will go straight to their functional pane rather than to the gossip pane. Most importantly this means that clicking on a flight master will bring up the flight path map directly rather than the gossip pane with the option to bring up the flight path map.
 * Quests that are much below your level will now have the tag (Low Level) in the gossip pane attached to the quest. This will make it easier to tell which quest to accept when a quest giver has both low and high level quests.

    * /threshold Epic- also sets the party loot threshold to Epic items or better quality
    * /threshold Rare-sets the party loot threshold to Rare items or better quality
   
   
 * Corpses that belong to someone in your party, but that you cannot loot will say in the corpse mouseover who has loot rights on that corpse. This will help skinners who want to know who to talk to in order to skin their corpse, as well as master looters when special loot drops on a normal monster. Everyone will then see that there is a monster that the master looter has loot rights on.
 * When an item drops that you cannot loot due to uniqueness or other factor, you will get a chat message letting you know what the item was that you passed rolling on.
 * If a player is looting a corpse and there are one or more items on it that player cannot loot, the player will still be able to see those items (although not able to loot them). This only is for green or better quality items. The cases this should affect are for the profession recipes that only a player of that profession can loot or when master looter is on and there is a threshold or better item on the corpse.
 * The raid panes that have been pulled out into the gamefield should save their option settings between sessions now.
 * When raid bosses send an important message to the center of your screen it will be larger and have an effect that makes it more noticeable.
 * The raid warning command now appears in a larger font in the center screen and grows and shrinks slightly when it appears to make it more noticeable.
 * NPC's with level appropriate quests will now always appear on your minimap as yellow exclamation points.

In addition flight masters that you have not yet gotten the flight point for will display on the minimap as a green exclamation point.
 * Npc's will display an icon on mouseover that gives a more specific indicator of their function rather than just a gossip bubble. Questgivers will now show an exclamation mark as their in game mouseover. Innkeepers will show a hearthstone as their in game mouseover and so on.
 * When an Addon attempts to perform an action that is prohibited in combat, you will get a chat message "Interface action failed because of an AddOn". This only occurs once per login.

 * Voice chat will now display the nameplate for who is talking when you are in a custom channel. Currently it only displays the nameplate when you are in a party/raid.
 * Added a Use Hardware option. This should only be used by advanced users with specific hardware configurations, as it may significantly alter your sound performance.
 * When multiple people are talking in a voice chat session, it will show the names of up to four people who are talking at the same time.
 * The value of the TargetNearestDistance setting is validated at load time.
 * If a non-standard refresh rate is selected in the video options, it will now be saved.
 * The Spell Detail slider setting has been reset to the default setting. Prior to 2.3 the default for all systems was the maximum setting which was not appropriate for all hardware.
 * Many On Use items now display the cooldown in the item tooltip.
 * The tooltip for Block on the character sheet now displays the amount of damage reduced by a successful block.
 * New macro commands: /targetlastenemy, /targetlastfriend
 * New macro command to target by entire name: /targetexact
 * If you get a message "Interface action failed because of an AddOn", this means that an AddOn interfered with the Blizzard UI in some way. To diagnose this, enter the following into chat "/console taintLog 1" and restart the game and try to reproduce it. If you reproduce it, you can quit the game and search through the file Logs\taint.log for the word "blocked" and mail the log to the author of the AddOn listed there. Once you have done this you can turn off logging by entering the following into chat "/console taintLog 0”

       * The queue system remains active for the entire battle. As soon as a player leaves, a new one will be chosen from the queue.
       * Trying to enter Wintergrasp during an active battle for which you have not been chosen will teleport you out. Please note that, as you are now able to fly over Wintergrasp, you will only be teleported out if you try to land and join the battle.

    * The ID of any instance to which a player is saved can be extended. Doing so will extend the instance lock period by the same amount of time as the original lock (i.e. extending an Ulduar instance ID will add 7 days, a Heroic: Halls of Lightning instance ID will add 24 hours, and a Zul'Gurub instance ID will add 3 days to the instance lock time).
    * An ID can be extended more than once.

 * Emblem System Changes
    * Both the 10 and 25-player instances of the Crusaders' Coliseum drop a new [Emblem of Triumph].

    * New achievements have been added to collect various amounts of any combination of emblems.

 * Tauren now have the option of changing skin tone by visiting the Barber Shop.

ITEMS: GENERAL

 * Agility: The amount of agility required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This change required recalibrating the amount of dodge a player has with 0 agility by a slight amount as well, so all players will see their dodge percentage vary a small amount.
 * Block rating: The amount of bonus block value on all items has been doubled. This does not affect the base block value on shields or block value derived from strength.
 * On-Use Block Value Items: All items and set bonuses that trigger temporary increases to block value have been modified. Instead of increasing their block value amount by 100% like other items, they have all had their effect durations doubled. This applies to [Glyph of Deflection], [Gnomeregan Autoblocker], [Coren's Lucky Coin], [Lavanthor's Talisman], [Libram of Obstruction], [Tome of the Lightbringer], [Libram of the Sacred Shield], the tier 8 paladin [Shield of Righteousness] bonus, the tier 5 paladin [Holy Shield] bonus, and the tier 5 warrior [Shield Block] bonus.
 * Dodge Rating: The amount of dodge rating required per percentage of dodge has been increased by 15%. This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply.

    * The Item Buy Back time will now expire if the player enchants or sockets an item. Players will see a confirmation dialog box now when they attempt to enchant or add gems to an item giving them a last chance to reconsider.
   
   
 * Items with Triggered Effects: These items generally have cooldowns on how often they can be triggered. Those cooldowns are now triggered each time the item is equipped (example: A trinket has a 45-second cooldown on an effect triggered by player attacks; when a player equips that item, the effect will be unable to be triggered for the first 45 seconds it is worn).
 * Mounts
    * The cast time for summoning any ground or flying [2] mount is now 1.5 seconds, down from 3 seconds.

    * Artisan Riding (Skill 300): Faction discounts now apply (Honor Hold or Valiance Expedition for Alliance; Thrallmar or Warsong Offensive for Horde).

    * Flying over Dalaran and Wintergrasp is now possible so long as players keep a healthy distance above the ground.
   
   
 * Mana Regeneration: All items that provide "X mana per five seconds" have had the amount of mana they regenerate increased by approximately 25%.
 * Parry Rating: The amount of parry rating required per percentage of parry has been reduced by 8%. This is before diminishing returns. Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply. Parry still diminishes more quickly than dodge.
 * Resilience: No longer reduces the amount of damage done by damage-over-time spells, but instead reduces the amount of all damage done by players by the same proportion. In addition, the amount of resilience needed to reduce critical strike chance, critical strike damage and overall damage has been increased by 15%.

CLASSES: GENERAL

 * All pets now receive 40% of their master's resilience and 100% of their master's spell penetration. In addition, if a player is at their appropriate spell hit chance or hit chance maximum, their pet will be at the maximum for spell hit chance, hit chance, and expertise. If they are below the maximum, their pet will be proportionately below those maximums.
 *  [Replenishment]: This buff now grants 1% of the target's maximum mana over 5 seconds instead of 0.25% per second. This applies to all 5 sources of Replenishment ( [Vampiric Touch], [Judgements of the Wise], [Hunting Party], [Enduring Winter] Frostbolts and [Soul Leech]).
 *  [Silence], [Strangulate], [Silencing Shot], and [Arcane Torrent]: These abilities will also apply a 3 second interrupt effect against non-player controlled targets, making them more versatile against creatures immune to silencing effects.

DEATH KNIGHTS

 * Due to significant talent changes, all death knight talents will be reset for players.
 *  [Blood Plague]: Damage done increased by 15%.

 *  [Frost Presence]: 10% bonus health reduced to 6% bonus stamina.

       *  [Lichborne]: Duration reduced to 10 seconds, and cooldown reduced to 2 minutes.
       *  [Threat of Thassarian]: New 3-point talent. When dual-wielding, your Death Strikes, Obliterates, Plague Strikes, Blood Strikes and Frost Strikes have a 30/60/100% chance to also deal damage with your off-hand weapon. Off-hand strikes are roughly one half the effect of the original strike.
       *  [Toughness]: This talent now grants 2/4/6/8/10% armor instead of 3/6/9/12/15%, placing it in line with similar abilities of other classes.
      
      
    * Unholy
       *  [Desecration]: This talent has been reduced to 2 points for 25/50% snare and no longer increases damage done by the death knight. It has also been moved one tier earlier in the tree and its spell effect has been made more transparent.
       *  [Desolation]: New talent. This talent is in the position formerly occupied by Desecration. It causes Blood Strikes to increase all damage the death knight deals by 1/2/3/4/5% for 12 seconds.
       *  [Scourge Strike]: Weapon damage bonus reduced to 40%, down from 45%. Damage increased by 10% per disease on the target, down from 11%.

       *  [Unholy Blight]: This talent has been redesigned. It no longer deals damage to nearby targets. Instead, when you deal damage with Death Coil, the target will take periodic damage for 10 seconds equal to 20% of the damage done by Death Coil. This damage accumulates in the same way as Ignite and Deep Wounds.

 *  [Exorcism]: Now has a 1.5 second cast time, but can once again be used on players.
 * Reckoning: Redesigned. Now does damage only when the target does not currently have the caster targeted, but damage done increased to 50% of attack power, occurring after the taunt effect is applied.
 * Judgments: Some of these attacks were considered ranged and some melee. They are all now considered melee attacks that can't be dodged, parried or blocked.

 *  [Lay on Hands]: The buff from this ability now reduces the physical damage taken by the target by 10/20% instead of increasing the target's armor.

 *  [Seal of Blood]: This ability has been removed.
 *  [Seal of the Martyr]: This ability has been removed.
 *  [Seal of Vengeance] and [Seal of Corruption]: These seals have been redesigned. Only auto-attacks and [Hammer of the Righteous] can place the debuff on the paladin's current target(s). However, while the seal is active, each melee swing or ability (excluding judgements) that lands on the target will deal a percentage of weapon damage as Holy damage to the target. This damage maxes out at 33% weapon damage with 5 applications of the debuff and scales upward evenly based on how many applications of the debuff are active. This Holy damage deals double-damage critical strikes. In addition, the damage-over-time debuff is now considered a melee attack for the purposes of determining its chance to hit, miss, be dodged or parried.
 *  [Shield of Righteousness]: Now deals 100% of shield block value as damage instead of 130%. In addition, the benefit from additional block value this ability gains is now subject to diminishing returns.

    * Holy
       *  [Beacon of Light]: The healing amount on the Beacon of Light target is now based on the total healing done (including over-healing) instead of the effective healing done.

       *  [Divine Intellect]: This talent now gives 2/4/6/8/10% increased intellect instead of 3/6/9/12/15%.

    * Protection
       *  [Ardent Defender]: Redesigned. Any damage that takes the paladin below 35% health is reduced. This reduction applies only to the portion that pushes the paladin below 35% health (example: a paladin at 50% health takes a 40% hit; the first 15% hits as normal while the next 25% is reduced). In addition, once every 2 minutes an attack that would have killed the paladin will fail to kill, and instead heal the paladin for up to 10/20/30% of maximum health depending on the paladin's defense rating (example: a paladin with defense equal to only 5 times his or her level will receive no healing from the talent, while a paladin who is immune to critical strikes from boss creatures through defense will receive the maximum amount).
       *  [Guarded by the Light]: This talent will no longer cause [Divine Plea]'s duration to be refreshed by using [Judgement of Wisdom], [Judgement of Justice], or [Judgement of Light].

       *  [Earth Shield]: Dispel effects will now remove charges of Earth Shield rather than the entire aura.

       *  [Mana Tide Totem]: Totem health now equal to 10% of the shaman's health.
       *  [Nature's Guardian]: Redesigned. Now has a fixed 100% proc rate, has a 30 second internal cooldown and increases the shaman's maximum health by 3/6/9/12/15% for 10 seconds.

Realm Restarts - Patch 3.2.0a - 8/19/09 | 2009-08-19 19:26 | Wymdar

We'll be releasing a minor bug fix patch to version 3.2.0a. This sort of patch is very small in size, and we use them to fix specific issues that can’t be hot-fixed. Issues addressed with this patch:
 * Fixed an exploit players were using with / commands.
 * Fixed a performance issue with players logging into the game.
 * Fixed an issue with Mac clients freezing near water.
 * Fixed a crash Mac clients were experiencing with shadows on Fixed Function cards.
 * Fixed an art issue with Freya Hard Mode where the light beams were visually too hard to see.
 * Fixed an issue with Loaner mounts requiring [Cold Weather Flying].

We will be bringing all realms down very soon for this small, but urgent patch. Downtime is expected to be quite minimal, as only rolling restarts will be required. Updating your game client will take only a small download.GENERAL

ICECROWN CITADEL: THE FROZEN HALLS

Looming over the stark wastes of Northrend, Icecrown Citadel awaits those who would see the Lich King and his Scourge brought low and the threat they pose wiped from the face of Azeroth. The heroes who venture within will face some of the greatest horrors yet seen. But before you burst into the front gate of the citadel, an alternate means of entry beckons. Journey through three separate wings of the new five-player dungeon, Icecrown Citadel: The Frozen Halls, and follow Jaina Proudmoore or Sylvanas Windrunner into the Lich King's domain.

ICECROWN CITADEL: THE FROZEN THRONE

All across Northrend, many battles have been fought against the vile Scourge. Countless lives have been lost since the Alliance and the Horde first reached these frozen wastes, but the champions of Azeroth continue to march forward—and Icecrown Citadel, the cornerstone of the Scourge's power and the home base of the Lich King, is their final target. Tirion Fordring and the Argent Crusade have forged an accord with Darion Mograine and the Knights of the Ebon Blade to form the Ashen Verdict. This coalition's strongest combatants, along with the champions of the Alliance and the Horde, will lead the charge against the citadel. In the new Icecrown Citadel raid dungeon, Azeroth's mightiest will face terrifying challenges before ascending to the Frozen Throne, where the Lich King and his runeblade, Frostmourne, await to deliver the heroes to their deaths...

CROSS-REALM DUNGEON FINDER

The Dungeon Finder is now available, providing players with quick and easy access to five-player parties. This feature connects all realms within a battlegroup using an advanced matchmaking system, making it easier for players of all levels to find a dungeon group. In addition, players can reap additional rewards through the Dungeon Finder by choosing the Random option, which is available to both pick-up and pre-formed groups. Check out the User Interface section for more details.

GETTING STARTED AND QUEST TRACKING

A number of changes have been made to World of Warcraft's introductory experience, including updated character and class information at the character-selection screen, more robust tooltips with images, improved health and mana regeneration at lower levels, and adjustments to various classes designed to make it easier for players to get started. In addition, all-new quest-tracking features have been added to assist players in finding objectives, including new interface functionality in the quest log, the map ("M" key), and the Objectives pane.

GENERAL

 * Icecrown Citadel
    * Three separate 5-player dungeons – The Forge of Souls, Pit of Saron, and Halls of Reflection – containing all new challenges and missions of discovery, await players in normal and Heroic modes.
    * 10- and 25-player challenges await players in Icecrown Citadel. Only when all challenges have been overcome in the raid dungeon can players unlock hard modes for individual bosses. For more information on how the Icecrown Citadel raid content will be made available, please visit our Dungeons & Raids forum.
   
   
 * Character Creation: The descriptions for races, classes, and race/class combinations have been improved to provide new players with a better idea of the roles and advantages of each class and race.
 * Dazed: Creatures attacking a player from behind can no longer cause players level 1-5 to be dazed, and have a reduced chance to cause players level 6-10 to be dazed.
 * Knockbacks no longer dismount players. If on a flying mount, you will be knocked back a short distance before being able to resume flying.
 * The existing /welcome emote now greets/welcomes targets (character says "hello"), while the new /yw is for saying "you're welcome."
 * Many of the tail sweeps with knockback effects will no longer hit players' pets.
 * Level 1 characters no longer start with food or water in their inventory.
 * Attack is now called Auto Attack. The tooltip has been changed to reflect that the player will continue automatically attacking a target.
 * Meeting Stones: To use any Meeting Stone, it is only required that the character's minimum level be 15. There is no maximum character level requirement for any Meeting Stone.

CLASSES: GENERAL

 * Area-of-Effect Damage Caps: We've redesigned the way area damage is capped when hitting many targets. Instead of a hard cap on total damage done, the game now caps the total damage done at a value equal to the damage the spell would do if it hit 10 targets. In other words, if a spell does 1000 damage to each target, it would hit up to 10 targets for 1000 each, but with more than 10 targets, each target would take 10,000 damage divided by the number of targets. 20 targets would be hit for 500 damage each in that example.
 * Attack: Level 1 druids, mages, priests, and warlocks will no longer start with the Attack button placed on their action bars by default.
 * Default Equipment: Starting weapons are now more uniform. Rogues now start with a pair of daggers equipped. All other classes except shamans start with a 2-handed weapon equipped and the required skill already known. Shamans start with a 1-handed weapon and a shield, as they benefit more from the shield than they would from a 2-handed weapon.
 * Glancing Blows: The mage, warlock, and priest classes no longer have an increased chance for their melee attacks to be glancing blows; and the damage penalty due to their glancing blows is the same as for other classes.
 * Health and Mana Regeneration: These regeneration rates have been increased by up to 200% for low level characters. As a player's level increases, the regeneration rates gradually reduce, returning to normal rates at level 15.
 * Pet Resilience: All player pets now get 100% of their master's resilience.
 * Spell Mana Costs: These costs have been reduced for almost all lower level spell ranks. In general, if a spell decreased in cost with a higher level rank in patch 3.2.0, that spell now has the decreased cost at all ranks. In addition, spells learned before level 20 with reduced cast times and/or durations have even further reduced mana costs, proportionate to their reduction in cast time or damage.
 * Taunt Diminishing Returns: We've revised the system for diminishing returns on Taunt so that creatures do not become immune to Taunt until after 5 Taunts have landed. The duration of the Taunt effect will be reduced by 35% instead of 50% for each taunt landed. In addition, most creatures in the world will not be affected by Taunt diminishing returns at all. Creatures will only have Taunt diminishing returns if they have been specifically flagged for that behavior based on the design of a given encounter.

RACES: GENERAL

 * Orc and troll shamans now have their own unique totem art.
 * Racial Attribute Bonuses: These bonuses have been recalibrated to even out the amount of starting health on the various races. All races start with a standardized level of stamina, except for orcs, dwarves, and tauren who now start with 1 extra point of stamina. For each class, bonuses and penalties to all attributes have been adjusted so that each race has an equal attribute total.
 *  [Will of the Forsaken] now shares a 45-second cooldown with similar effects, including the [Medallion of the Horde]ω , Titan-Forged runes, [Insignia of the Horde], etc.

PVP

 * Arenas
    * All abilities that have base cooldowns of 10 minutes or longer cannot be used in Arenas, down from 15 minutes.
   
   
 * Battlegrounds
    * Battleground Experience: Battleground experience gained is now based on the level of the player gaining experience, rather than the highest possible player level in that Battleground.
    * All level 71-80 Battleground daily quests will now award 25 Arena points in addition to their current rewards.
   
   
 * Wintergrasp
    * You must now have the following ranks to build or pilot siege vehicles:
       * Rank 2: Build/pilot Catapults.
       * Rank 3: Build/pilot Demolishers.
       * Rank 3: Build/pilot Siege Engines.
      
      
   
   

DUNGEONS & RAIDS

 * Naxxramas
    * Players no longer need to kill the final bosses in all four wings of this dungeon in order to teleport to Sapphiron. Teleportation orbs have been added to allow players access back and forth from Sapphiron's lair.
   
   
 * Oculus
    * Azure Ring Guardians aggro distance changed from 50 to 40 yards.
    * Many bosses and creatures have had their total health reduced.
    * Several bosses and creatures have had cooldowns on specific abilities increased, effect durations reduced, and damage on some of these abilities reduced.
    * Ring-Lord Conjurers and Sorceresses now hang out in packs of 4 instead of packs of 5.
    * Vehicle scaling on the drakes based on the rider's item level has been increased to make them more powerful.

       *  [Scourge Strike]: Redesigned. The base ability now deals 50% weapon damage plus an additional amount as physical damage. However, for each disease the death knight has on the target, the target will take additional shadow damage equal to 25% of the physical damage done.
       *  [Unholy Blight]: This talent now deals only 10% of [Death Coil] damage as a damage-over-time effect on the target.

 *  [Deterrence]: Now also increases the chance for ranged attacks to miss the hunter by 100% while under its effect.

In addition, multiple hunters can now misdirect threat to the same friendly target simultaneously.
 * Talents
    * Beast Mastery
       *  [Intimidation]: If the hunter's pet is in melee range of its target, the stun from Intimidation will now be applied immediately instead of on the pet's next swing or attack.
      
      
   
   
 * Pets
    * Avoidance: This talent has been replaced by [Culling the Herd]. Hunter pets now innately take 90% less damage from area-of-effect abilities like all other class pets. This does not apply to area-of-effect damage caused by other players.
    *  [Cower]: Redesigned. This ability no longer affects threat, and instead reduces damage taken by the pet by 40% for 6 seconds with a 45-second cooldown. While cowering, the pet's movement speed is 50% of normal speed. Cower now only has a single rank and is available at pet level 20.
    *  [Culling the Herd]: This pet talent has replaced the Avoidance talent in the pet trees (Hunter pets now gain that benefit automatically without expenditure of talent points).

    *  [Demoralizing Screech]: The attack power reduction from this ability has been increased by 40%, equaling the maximum possible attack power reduction from the abilities of other classes.
    *  [Improved Cower]: Redesigned. This talent now reduces the movement penalty of Cower by 50%/100%.

In addition, the duration has been changed to 6 seconds, however the effect does not terminate when Divine Sacrifice is removed before its full duration.
       *  [Divine Sacrifice]: Redesigned. The effect of Divine Sacrifice is now party-only and the maximum damage which can be transferred is now limited to 40% of the paladin's health multiplied by the number of party members. In addition, the bug which allowed Divine Sacrifice to sometimes persist despite reaching its maximum damage has been fixed.

Existing characters will automatically learn this new spell in place of the totem. With a Fire Totem active, shamans will be able to use Fire Nova (fire magic) to emit the same area-of-effect damage as the old Fire Nova Totem from the active Fire Totem, not consuming the totem in the process. Fire Nova will activate a 1.5-second global cooldown when used and has a 10-second spell cooldown.

       *  [Conflagrate]: Redesigned. This talent now consumes an [Immolate] or [Shadowflame] effect on the enemy target to instantly deal damage equal to 9 seconds of Immolate or 8 seconds of Shadowflame, and causes additional damage over 3 seconds equal to 3 seconds of Immolate or 2 seconds of Shadowflame. In addition, the periodic damage of Conflagrate is capable of critically striking the afflicted target.
       *  [Destructive Reach]: This talent now reduces threat by 10%/20%, up from 5%/10%.

       *  [Damage Shield]: This ability will no longer trigger any chance-on-hit effects from the warrior or the opponent it damages.
      
      
   
   

USER INTERFACE

 * Many of the default Interface Options settings have been changed for greater ease of use by new players. Existing players who create new characters may want to review the Interface Options in the event that the default settings feel different.
 * Quest Tracking Feature
    * Players can now track quest objectives on the map ('M' key).
    * Quest Log
       * A Show Map button has been added to the Quest Log.

Any other active quests in a player's Quest Log for that zone will also be displayed.
      
      
    * Map
       * The map interface has been separated into four separate panes: a map pane (left), a pane listing active quest names for the zone being viewed (right), a pane listing the full quest text for any highlighted quest (bottom left), and a pane listing the quest rewards for any highlighted quest (bottom right).
       * All active quests listed in the right pane for the zone being viewed on the map will be assigned a number. These numbers will be displayed on the map according to the areas of interest for each quest.
       * Highlighting a quest name in the right pane will highlight the corresponding area of interest on the map in the left pane, show its quest text in the lower left pane, and list the quest rewards in the lower right pane.
       * Given that some quest objectives can be achieved in multiple locations within a given zone, highlighting such a quest will highlight an area of interest closest in proximity to the character's current location.
       * This feature can be disabled by un-checking the Show Quest Objectives box in the bottom right corner of the new map interface, restoring the map to its standard full-screen display.
       * Clicking on the arrow in the top right corner of the new map interface will hide all but the map pane, bringing the map out of full-screen mode and allowing players to leave it open while navigating a zone or engaging in combat.
      
      
    * Objectives Tracking
       * This frame has been improved to offer new functionality and can be used with the new shrunken map option.
       * The Objectives frame is now docked below the mini-map next to the right 2 action bars and will track up to 10 quests for a zone.
       * Numbers have been added next to each quest name and objective corresponding with those areas of interest displayed on the map.
       * If a quest objective has been completed, the number will be replaced with a yellow question mark symbol.
       * The arrow button in the top right corner of the Objectives frame can be used to toggle between minimizing and maximizing the quest objective display.
      
      
    * Quest Difficulty Tracking

 * Dungeon Finder
    * This feature has replaced the Looking For Group tool and provides all-new dungeon party creation functionality.
       * Players can join as individuals, as a full group, or a partial group to look for additional party members.
       * Groups using this tool will be able to teleport directly to the selected instance. Upon leaving the instance, players will be returned to their original location. If any party member needs to temporarily leave the instance for reagents or repairs, they will have the option to teleport back to the instance.
       * Players can choose the Random Dungeon option.
          * The Heroic Wrath of the Lich King Daily Random Dungeon option will award two [Emblems of Frost] no more than once a day.
          * The normal Wrath of the Lich King Daily Random Dungeon option will award two [Emblems of Triumph] no more than once a day.
          * Continuing to complete Wrath of the Lich King Heroic instances using the Daily Random Dungeon option will award players two additional Emblems of Triumph each time.
          * Daily Heroic and normal dungeon quests have been removed. These quests have been replaced with weekly raid quests (see the "Quests" section for details).
          * Level-appropriate rewards will be offered to players who choose the Random Dungeon option for pre-Wrath of the Lich King dungeons.
          * Players can be placed in a group for a random dungeon no more than once every 15 minutes.
          * Random Dungeon rewards will be placed in each player's inventory automatically upon completion of the dungeon (final boss killed). A pop-up notification will display any rewards earned through the Dungeon Finder.
         
         
       * Instead of choosing a random dungeon, players can also choose specific dungeons appropriate for their level range. Multiple instances can be selected at one time. The feature no longer limits the choice to look for only 3 dungeon groups at one time.
       * Pick-Up Groups
          * Cross-realm instances are now available and use an improved matchmaking system to assist players in looking for additional party members. As with Battlegrounds, the realms in each Battlegroup are connected.
          * As part of the matchmaking system, some of the more difficult dungeons will have a minimum gear requirement. Players also need to meet the requirements for dungeons that require attunement, such as keys or quests. If a player does not meet the requirements for a particular dungeon, a lock icon will be displayed next to that dungeon. Hovering over this icon will display the requirements which have not been met.
          * Only conjured items and loot dropped in a dungeon for which other party members are eligible can be traded between players from different realms.
          * A Vote Kick feature will be available in the event a member of a party is not performing to the expectations of the other members.
          * Players who leave the group prematurely are subject to a Deserter debuff preventing them from using the Dungeon Finder for 15 minutes.
          * If an existing group loses a member, the leader will be asked if he or she wants to continue the dungeon. Choosing to continue will automatically place the group back into the Dungeon Finder queue.
          * A Player will not be placed in a group with people on his or her Ignore list.
          * Players who take part in groups who have one or more members who have been matched with them randomly from within the Dungeon Finder will receive extra rewards, up to and including the coveted [Perky Pug] non-combat pet. The more random players with whom one groups, the faster the pet can be obtained.
          * The Need Before Greed loot system will be the unalterable default looting system for pick-up groups in the Dungeon Finder and has been updated.
             * Need Before Greed will now recognize gear appropriate for a class in three ways: the class must be able to equip the item, pure melee will be unable to roll on spell power items, and classes are limited to their dominant armor type (ex. paladins for plate). All items will still be available via Greed rolls as well as the new Disenchant option should no member be able to use the item.
             * Players will be able to roll on items with a required minimum level higher than a player's current level.
            
            
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Looking For Raid
    * There is a new Looking For Raid option available to players that can be accessed via the Raid Information screen in the interface or by typing "/LFR".
       * Players will be able to browse the system manually for any other players looking for a raid dungeon group.
       * While browsing LFR players may sort the list ascending or descending by left-clicking the following headers: Name, Level, Class, Tank Role, Healer Role, and Damage Role. The crown is the Leader Role (representing a raid group with 2 or more people). Players can left-click on this header to sort the list with groups at the top or at the bottom.
       * Hovering over players listed in LFR will display their name, class, level, roles and comments. Hovering over a raid/group will display the leader's name, the raid information (number of people in the raid), comments, if there are any bosses dead (and which ones), and if there are any friends from your Friends list or ignored players from your Ignore list in the raid group.
      
      
   
   
 * The Looking For Group chat channel has returned and can be accessed in all major cities (similar to the Trade chat channel) without the use of the Dungeon Finder interface.
 * Players may only be queued or listed in one of the following systems at a time: Dungeons, LFR, Battlegrounds, or Arenas.
 * Ignore List: The amount of characters a person can ignore has been increased to 50. In addition, players on other realms can be placed on the Ignore list.
 * Buffs and Debuffs: This is a new section added to Interface Options.
    * New option - Castable Debuffs: Enabling this will cause only debuffs you have cast on an enemy target to appear.
    * New option - Consolidate Buffs: Enabling this adds a buff consolidation box near the mini-map. Very short term buffs (e.g. [Replenishment]) and very long term buffs (e.g. [Prayer of Fortitude]) are filtered into the buff box. The icons are stacked here, but they can still be seen by moving the mouse cursor over the buff box. Long term buffs will move out of the box when they are about to expire. Buffs such as important procs (e.g. Art of War, Maelstrom Weapon), cooldowns (e.g. [Bloodlust] / [Heroism], [Combustion]) or limited in range (e.g. totems and paladin auras) are always displayed.
   
   
 * Tutorial System: The tutorial pop-ups are now larger, contain images, and better try to direct players to the relevant locations or user interface elements on the screen. In addition, several new tips have been added, while some existing tips will now appear at more appropriate times for new players.
 * Dungeon & Raid Difficult Display: A group's dungeon or raid difficulty setting will now be displayed via an icon off of the mini-map.
 * Group Disenchanting Option: In addition to rolling Need or Greed on items, players now have the option to elect for an item to be disenchanted if an enchanter of the appropriate skill level is in the group. Disenchant works exactly like Greed except if a player wins the Greed roll, they will receive the disenchanted materials instead. Players who choose Need will always win the item and will always beat those that choose Greed or Disenchant.
 * Lag Reports: Players can now report high latency or lag by accessing the Help Request menu.
 * Unit Nameplates
    * The range at which players can see unit nameplates has been increased by 40 yards.
    * Unit nameplates are now subject to line-of-sight limitations in certain situations (this does not pertain to objects like Arena pillars or bridges).
    * Players can now adjust select unit nameplate display settings listed below under Interface Options via the Names tab.
       * Friendly/enemy pet nameplates can be toggled.
       * Enemy totem nameplates can be toggled (friendly totem nameplates are never displayed).
       * Players can choose whether or not unit nameplates overlap.
      
      
    * Unit nameplates for critters are never displayed.
   
   
 * Non spell-based tracking now persists through logout.

 * Players will be warned when their talents are reset due to a new patch.
 * "/Settitle" command has been added.
 * Instant quest text is on by default.
 * Tentative status added for calendar responses.
 * Players below level 10 may not join raids.
 * Ignore list expanded to 50 to match the friends list.
 * Unit frames added for special encounters.
 * Interface element added next to the mini-map to show what dungeon you are in (ex: 10- and 25-player Heroic dungeons marked with a skull).
 * Experience earned for a quest will display in the Quest Rewards section.
 * Confirmation box added when buying stable slots.
 * Macro Changes
    * Symbol "@" added as a synonym for "target=". For example: "/cast [@focus] Flash Heal".
    * New macro conditionals: "vehicleui" (if the player has a vehicle UI) and "unithasvehicleui" (if the target of the macro has a vehicle UI).
   
   
 * Addon Author Changes
    * "registerForClicks" added to XML buttons.
    * "MouseIsOver" has been converted to a "C" function for increased efficiency (e.g. /dump PlayerFrame:IsMouseOver() ).
    * When an addon file is loaded, the addon name and an addon table are passed to the file through '...'. The same addon table is passed to every file loaded by a particular TOC file (example at the top of a Lua file: "local addonName, addonTable = ...;".
    * "motionScriptsWhileDisabled" attribute added to buttons. This allows "OnEnter" and "OnLeave" to fire while the button is disabled.
    * "GetFileHeight()" and "GetFileWidth()" added to Texture objects. 0 is returned if no texture file is associated with the texture.
    * You can now query for a list of completed quests with "QueryQuestsCompleted()" then wait for the "QUEST_QUERY_COMPLETE" event, and call "GetQuestsCompleted(<luatable>)".
   
   
 * For additional notes on Lua and XML changes please visit the UI & Macros forum.

GRAPHICS

 * A new feature has been added to the D3D graphics engine to improve texture management (particularly for Windows XP users). If you are experiencing random crashes related to file read errors or out of memory, this new backend may help. To enable the new backend, add the following line to your Config.WTF file: SET gxApi "d3d9ex". For more information please visit our Tech Support forum.

PROFESSIONS

 * Enchanting
    * Enchant Weapon - Black Magic: This enchantment now sometimes increases haste rating for the caster rather than inflicting the caster's target with a damage-over-time effect. It is also now triggered by landing any harmful spell rather than inflicting damage with a spell.
    * Enchant Weapon - Unholy: This enchantment now inflicts Shadow damage in addition to its original effect.
   
   
 * First Aid
    * The training costs for most bandages have been reduced.
   
   
 * Fishing
    * The all-new Kalu'ak Fishing Derby, a test of fishing skill with a healthy dash of luck, has come to Northrend! Every Saturday beginning at 2 PM players can try to catch the elusive [Blacktip Shark]. Elder Clearwater sits in Dalaran for one hour awaiting the return of the quickest, most experienced fisher to bring him this shark. This champion fisher will be rewarded in-kind for returning with the first catch. Those who aren't able to return with the first catch will still receive just reward for getting the Blacktip Shark to Elder Clearwater before he takes his leave. It is said that these sharks' favorite meal are the bite-sized [Pygmy Suckerfish]. Perhaps a hook in their waters will do the trick.
   
   
 * Mining
    * Enchanted Thorium: This ability now uses the Mining skill and is learned from trainers at a skill level of 250.
   
   

QUESTS

 * Weekly raid quests are now available from Archmage Lan'dalock in Dalaran. Every Tuesday at 3 AM the Council of Six will choose a different strategic target that must die from either: The Obsidian Sanctum, Naxxramas, The Eye of Eternity, Ulduar, Trial of the Crusader, or Icecrown Citadel.

 * " The Party's Over" has been removed from Achievements and is no longer a part of the " Glory of the Hero" Meta-Achievement.
 * " Master Angler of Stranglethorn" has been changed to " Master Angler of Azeroth" and can be achieved by winning either the Kalu'ak Fishing Derby or the Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza.

REPUTATION

 * Commendation Badges which award reputation with various Wrath of the Lich King factions can be purchased with [Emblems of Triumph] in Dalaran. Each badge costs 1 Emblem of Triumph.
 * Gaining reputation with the Ashen Verdict in Icecrown Citadel will grant players access to upgradeable rings from Ormus the Penitent. Players can switch between the type of ring (melee/caster/tank/healer) at any point in the upgrade path for 200.
 * The following reputations have been sped up by roughly 30%:
    * Argent Crusade

Other items or gold cannot be sent via mail to characters on the same realm and account if they are from differing factions.
 * Death Knight Tier-9 4-Piece Bonus (Damage-Dealing): This set bonus no longer grants [Frost Fever] a chance to be a critical strike. It still grants that possibility to [Blood Plague].

TECHNICAL SUPPORT

 * The cvar 'processAffinityMask' controls which CPU cores are available for the World of Warcraft client to use.

In the past this provided a performance boost on some CPUs and operating systems. We have identified several systems that are experiencing severe performance issues with this restriction and have removed it. Players who would like to restore the old behavior can do so by updating the Config.WTF file by adding: SET processAffinityMask "3".

PVP

 * The amount of Honor awarded for an Honorable Kill has been increased by 100% for characters of all levels. Since all Honor is awarded based on a conversion rate from Honorable Kills, this change will effectively double the amount of Honor received from Honorable Kills, or for completing Battleground and Wintergrasp objectives; however, the amount of experience gained from completing Battleground objectives and the amount of Honor rewarded for completing each Wintergrasp quest remain unchanged.

       * Bonus rewards will be offered for choosing the Random Battleground option.
          * Winning a Battleground using the Random Battleground option for the first time in a day will award players with 30 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency and 25 Arena points.

          * Losing a Battleground using the Random Battleground option will award players with 5 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.

       * When using the Random Battleground option, players will not receive additional rewards if the Battleground chosen is under the Call to Arms bonuses. In addition, the rewards for the first victory of the day cannot be earned more than once, regardless of whether or not it is obtained from the Random Battleground system or the Call to Arms Battleground.
      
      
   
   
 * Wintergrasp
    * The internal balance system now only changes when a faction achieves 2 consecutive defenses after an initial capture of Wintergrasp, up from 1. More details can be found on our PvP Discussion forum.

       * All rare holiday items (such as [The Horseman's Reins]) will have a chance of being found in holiday-themed loot troves which will drop once for each player in the party no more than once per day, in the same manner that doing the Random Dungeon daily quest will provide a specific reward the first time it is completed in a day.

       *  [Improved Icy Talons]: This effect is now passive instead of being a proc. The self haste buff remains unchanged.

    * Unholy
       *  [Scourge Strike]: Now deals 70% weapon damage, plus 12% of physical damage done as shadow damage for each of the death knight's diseases on the target.

QUESTS

 * Many quests which require vehicles have had their vehicle mechanics updated and improved in the interest of fun.

USER INTERFACE

 * All Alert pop-ups now have new and fresh Alert icons.
 * Auction House
    * If the Auction House on a realm is unavailable for any reason, an alert will pop up informing players who attempt to access it.
    * Players can now Right-Click to place an item in the Auction frame.
    * Entire stacks of a specific item type can be placed in the Auction frame and several options have been added for choosing how to list auctions.
       * Stack Size: If a stack of items has been added to the Auction frame, players can select the size of the stack they wish to sell. If an invalid stack size is entered (i.e. a stack of 21 Saronite Ore), the Create Auction button will be grayed out.
       * Number of Stacks: In addition to selecting the size of a stack, players can select how many stacks of an item they wish to sell (i.e. if a player has a total of 43 Saronite Ore in the Auction frame, they can choose to list 2 stacks of 20, 4 stacks of 10, 8 stacks of 5, 43 stacks of 1, etc. If the number and amount of stacks listed results in a remainder, the left-over items will be placed back in the player's bags automatically).
       * Stack Size and Number of Stacks are linked mathematically so that altering the variables of one may automatically calculate the amount of the other (i.e. if a player puts 20 in the Stack Size field and 43 Saronite Ore are in the Auction frame, the Number of Stacks field will change to 2 by default. If a player only wishes to sell one stack of 20 Saronite Ore, the Number of Stacks field can be manually changed to 1).
       * Price: Players can now choose to input the price of an item Per Stack or Per Item by selecting either option from a pull-down. If Per Item is selected and a player is selling a stack of that item, the Auction House will multiply the selected Per Item price by the amount of that item in the stack. If Per Stack is selected, the player can enter the total price he or she wishes to charge for each stack of that item being listed.
       * Auction Post Completion Bar: If multiple items or stacks of items are being listed at once by a player, a Posting completion bar will appear showing the total progress of each individual auction being listed once the Create Auction button is selected. The greater the number of individual listings being made in a single press of the Create Auction button, the longer this process will take. Players can still browse the Auction House while the Posting completion bar is in progress, but moving around will interrupt the progress, similar to moving while attempting to create multiple bandages with First Aid. Just as with creating bandages, auctions that were completed prior to the character moving or otherwise canceling the action will successfully be listed.
      
      
   
   
 * Dungeon Finder
    * The Deserter debuff given to players who leave a dungeon prematurely when queuing via the Random Dungeon option has been increased to 30 minutes, up from 15 minutes. The cooldown for using the Random Dungeon option remains 15 minutes.
    * The Random Dungeon cooldown is no longer displayed as a debuff. Instead, players will see the cooldown time remaining displayed in the Dungeon Finder window when Random Dungeon or Random Heroic Dungeon is selected from the pull-down.
    * If a player in your party has the Deserter debuff, or is on cooldown from the Random Dungeon option, his or her character name will be displayed in the Dungeon Finder window listed as "On Cooldown," preventing the group from queuing.
    * Anyone in a dungeon party can now re-queue their group for a dungeon, as players will still be prompted whether or not to accept their chosen role.
    * Players who use the Vote Kick option will now be prompted to provide a reason for kicking a party member. This reason will be presented to everyone in the party except for the person voted to be kicked.
    * When joining as a group, more generous level requirements will be used instead of Random Dungeon level requirements so that players of different levels joining together will be eligible for a greater number of dungeons.
    * Parties randomly created via the Dungeon Finder will always be arranged in the party interface from top to bottom in the following order: tank, healer, damage, damage, damage.
    * If a random party is created via the Dungeon Finder and a player cannot roll Need on an item, a reason will now be provided.
    * Players can no longer roll Need on Frozen Orbs in dungeons under Need Before Greed loot rules. Pass and Greed options will still be available.
   
   

The new authenticator field, for users with the Battle.net authenticator.
 * Authenticator Frame: If a player has a Battle.net Authenticator attached to his or her account and selects Remember Account Name at the login screen, the next time that player logs into World of Warcraft, a field to input the Authenticator code will be displayed below the password field.
 * The World Map will now provide an option to display different levels of a multi-layered dungeon, zone, or city (i.e. players can view the map of the Dalaran Sewers without having to be in that location).

Easily identifiable
 * Quest Tracking Feature
    * The Quest Tracking Objectives Frame can now be widened via the Interface Options menu.
    * The short description for a tracked quest is now displayed on the Map in the quest pane.
    * Quest items in a player's inventory which begin quests now each have an exclamation point overlaid on their icons to make them more easily identifiable.
    * If a players selects Track Low Level Quests, the quest objectives will no longer appear dim on the Map, nor will the exclamation points appear dim over NPC heads or on the Mini-Map.
    * Objectives Frame
       * The Objectives Frame will now list the number of quests displayed at the top. In addition, players can now click on the word "Objectives" at the top of the Objectives Frame for a list of sorting and filtering options which will determine how quests are ordered. Any quests or achievements filtered or sorted out of the Objectives Frame are still being tracked and are simply hidden in this frame.
          * Sorting
             * Sort by most difficult quests.
             * Sort by least difficult quests.
             * Sort by quests closest in proximity to the player (this will automatically update as players travel around).
             * Manual sorting: This allows players to Right-Click on each quest name in the Objectives Frame and determine in what order they should be placed.
            
            
          * Filtering
             * Toggle achievement tracking.
             * Toggle completed quest tracking.
             * Toggle tracking quest objectives in other zones.
            
            
         
         
       * Players can now Shift + Click on a quest objective or check the Track Quest box on the Map to track a quest in the Objectives Frame.

ASSAULT ON THE RUBY SANCTUM

For ages the red dragonflight and its noble matriarch, Alexstrasza the Life-Binder, have dedicated themselves to preserving all life on Azeroth. Recently, the very heart of this virtuous dragonflight has come under threat.


An eerie silence has settled over the Ruby Sanctum, the red dragonflight's sacred lair within the Chamber of the Aspects. This troubling development has led to fears that the sanctum, home to Azeroth's largest clutch of red dragon eggs, has been breached by an unknown, sinister force. If these claims are true and immediate action is not taken, the benevolent red dragonflight might be crippled forever.

REAL ID: A NEW WAY TO CONNECT WITH YOUR FRIENDS ON BATTLE.NET

One of our goals for the new Battle.net is to create the framework for an online gaming experience that is even more accessible, more engaging, and more entertaining than the previous Battle.net. The newly released Real ID feature, available to World of Warcraft players as part of patch 3.3.5, is an integral part of this effort, providing you with advanced ways for forming and maintaining meaningful relationships with your friends on the service.


Real ID is a completely voluntary and optional level of identity that keeps players connected across all of Battle.net. When you and a friend mutually agree to become Real ID friends, you'll have access to a number of additional features that will enrich your social gaming experience in new and exciting ways. Go here for more details.

GENERAL

 * The Ruby Sanctum, an all-new 10- and 25-player raid dungeon featuring normal and Heroic difficulties, has been added! Players will find the dungeon entrance below Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight. Please note due to the way this patch is being applied in all regions, this dungeon will not immediately be available in North America. Stay tuned to our General Discussion forum for an official announcement on the opening of the Ruby Sanctum.
 * The functionality of the Vote Kick feature in the Dungeon Finder will now behave differently according to a player's history with the system. Players using the Dungeon Finder who rarely vote to kick players from a group, or rarely abandon groups before a dungeon is complete, will find that the Vote Kick option will have no cooldown. For players who frequently abandon groups or vote to kick other players, the Vote Kick option will be kept on a cooldown. This functionality will adjust itself as a player's behavior while using the Dungeon Finder changes.

USER INTERFACE
CHAT FRAME

 * Players can now right-click on any chat type (Tell, Trade, General, Party, Raid, etc.) and choose to move conversation types into separate windows. This will move that chat type to a separate tab in the Chat frame which can be undocked and moved anywhere on the screen.
    * Using the Move to Whisper Window option on a Whisper will place the conversation with that player in a separate tab.
    * Any time a conversation with another player is put into its own tab, the tab will glow when a new message is received.
   
   
 * Hovering over the Chat Frame and using the mouse wheel will allow players to scroll through chat text.
 * Players can select Classic Mode under Interface Options to keep the Chat Frame functionality closer to what it was prior to patch 3.3.5.
 * The Simple Chat User Interface option has been removed.

FRIENDS LIST

 * A new icon has been added to the top left of the Chat Frame which will open up the Friends list.
 * In addition to its current functionality, the Friends List will now allow players to add Battle.net accounts (Real ID). Players will have to confirm that they are friends in order for a Real ID to be added. Once Real ID friends, players can communicate cross-game, cross-faction and cross-realm.
 * A new Pending tab has been added where players can accept or decline a Real ID friend request, or select the Report Spam or Block Communications buttons.
 * Players can now select from three statuses which will be visible to their friends: Available, Away and Busy.
 * A Broadcast window has been added to the top of the frame. Players can use this to broadcast a message to all of their Real ID friends online. This message will also be displayed under the broadcaster's Real ID information in each friend's list.
 * For additional notes on Lua and XML changes please visit the UI & Macros forum.

BUG FIXES

 * WoW can now be launched on machines with Windows XP SP2.
 * Vertical scroll bars now appear in the "Chatting with a GM" window.
 * Fixed the memory leaks occurring on certain machines.

GENERAL

 * Cataclysm Launcher Update
    * The new Cataclysm Launcher allows you to stream game data while you play. This will reduce the time you spend downloading, installing, and patching World of Warcraft. We'd like to get your feedback on the toolset and gameplay experience. Please head to the forums here for additional information.
   
   
 * Reforging
    * Players can now visit special Reforging NPCs in capital cities located near Enchanting trainers. 40% of any one secondary stat on an item can be allocated to add a new secondary stat to the item. The stat being added cannot already exist on the item. An item cannot have more than one reforged stat at a time, though the Reforging of an item can be undone and changed.
   
   

DUNGEONS AND RAIDS

 * Flexible Raid Lock System
    * Icecrown Citadel and Ruby Sanctum now use the new Flexible Raid Lock system. This system provides the opportunity for a character to defeat each raid zone’s encounters once a week. A character may now complete the encounters during the week with different raids of either 10 or 25 players.
    * Learn more about this feature by visiting the official European forums here: http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=14713237976&sid=1
   
   
 * Icecrown Citadel
    * The Chill of the Throne effect has been removed.
   
   

CURRENCY

 * PvE Currency Changes
    * All [Emblems of Frost] and [Emblems of Triumph] have been converted to new [Justice Points].
    * Any dungeon or raid which awarded these emblems will reward Justice Points instead. Anything below Emblems of Triumph, including badges from The Burning Crusade dungeon and raid content, have been converted into gold and sent to players via the in-game mail system.
    * Any bosses players defeat that are level-appropriate to them award Justice Points.
    * All items that previously cost emblems or badges of any type now cost Justice Points.
    * Higher-tier Valor Points will be awarded to players who kill dungeon and raid bosses in the latest tier of PvE content after the launch of Cataclysm.
   
   
 * PvP Currency Changes
    * All Arena Points, Honor Points, Battleground Marks of Honor, [Stone Keeper's Shards], [Venture Coins], and [Spirit Shards] have been converted into new Honor Points.
    * Honor Points will be awarded instead of these currencies, with the exception of Arena Points.
    * Higher-tier Conquest Points will be awarded to players competing in each of the latest Arena or Rated Battleground seasons after the launch of Cataclysm.
   
   
 * For more information on the changes to the currencies and conversion rates for each type, please visit Blizzard's official Cataclysm forum: http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=14574620792&sid=1

WARLOCKS

 * There is now a new spell fly-out UI feature for warlock pets. Clicking on this single button will open up the list of available pets to summon.

ITEMS

 * Resilience no longer reduces the chance a player will be critically hit by an opponent.
 * Durability: cloth, leather, and mail now have as many points of durability as plate, making the repair cost on death much closer to equal for all classes.

PROFESSIONS

 * The glyph system has been updated to now feature three different types of glyphs, Prime, Major and Minor glyphs, 3 for each type for a total of 9 slots available at one time. Now glyphs are learned permanently on use, much alike a spell learned from a class trainer. Removing/replacing a glyph you have "activated" from your spellbook now costs 1x [Vanishing Powder], for characters lev. 80 or lower, while for characters lev. 81 or higher will require 1x [Dust of Disappearance] for each glyph you want to remove/replace. Many class glyphs have been added, altered, or moved to different glyph types.

 * When in a Looking For Dungeon group, using an instance portal to that instance will now take players to the Looking For Dungeon entrance point instead of the normal destination of that portal. This will make it easier to return to the instance after dying in an LFD group.
 * Honorable Kills are no longer awarded for killing players below level 5.

USER INTERFACE

 * Added pets to the new raid unit frames when displayed in party.
 * The default UI Scale has been altered so it will be set at a 1:1 pixel/texel ratio. This will result in a smaller UI appearance for higher resolution monitors.
 * Players may now adjust the local "Lag Tolerance" time for better precision of spell timing. This is an advanced-users-only feature found in the Interface Options (Combat) panel. (Must be turned on before able to adjust the slider).

BUG FIXES

 * Macros now handle spell variant transitions better. For example, [Trap Launcher] causes a different version of Frost Trap to be cast. Previously the macro system was not handling this transition properly.
 * Queuing in Looking For Dungeon for a different wing of the instance a player is already in now works properly. For example, a party can now queue for Scarlet Monastery - Library after completing Scarlet Monastery - Graveyard.
 * Killing High Interrogator Gerstahn before killing Emperor Dagran Thaurissan in a Blackrock Depths - Upper City random Looking For Dungeon run will now provide the proper reward. This also applies to Archmage Arugal and the Crown Chemical Company bosses in Shadowfang Keep during the Love is in the Air holiday event.
 * Repeatedly inspecting other players should now function correctly.
 * Area heal-over-time effects should no longer cause players to stand up.
 * Male blood elves have received a crash course in dancing and now know to stop dancing when they run.

    * Shadow

RISE OF THE ZANDALARI

The days when great troll empires stretched across ancient Kalimdor are long past. Millennia of war and internal strife have stripped these nations of their power, lands, and glory. As Azeroth recovers from the destruction of the Cataclysm, the world's divided troll populations face a bleak future. These dark times have spurred the trolls of the Zandalar, the historically wise and scholarly tribe from which all trolls originated, to take drastic action. They have embarked on a bold crusade to save their race by uniting trolls into a single mighty empire. With the Zandalari's aid, the fallen capitals of the Gurubashi and Amani nations—Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman—are already rebuilding, replenishing their forces for a bloody campaign to expand their territories.


Yet Vol'jin and his Darkspear trolls are not aligned with the Zandalari. They have sworn to stand with their Horde comrades—and even work with the Alliance—should the trolls ignite a new war on Azeroth. Soon, Vol'jin might be forced to act on his promise, for if the Gurubashi and Amani are left to their own devices, the world will know the legendary strength and savagery of the ancient troll empires once again.

GUILD CHALLENGES

Built into the Info panel of the guild user interface, Guild Challenges are weekly tasks guild groups can tackle for additional guild experience, achievements, and gold. At the top of the guild user interface Info pane, a new Guild Challenges section is displayed and broken into three categories: Dungeons, Raids, and Rated Battlegrounds. Any guild group will qualify for Guild Challenges credit and there is a set number of times each challenge can be completed per week.

GUILD FINDER

Guild Finder is a new system designed to enable easier and faster guild recruitment. Guild leaders and players who are looking for a guild to call home will use the Guild Finder to meet one another and begin communications that can lead to a prosperous membership. Whether you're a guild leader looking to fill your ranks or a player looking for a guild that meets your strictest requirements, the Guild Finder provides an easy way to make new friends!

DUNGEON FINDER: CALL TO ARMS

A new system intended to lower queue times, Dungeon Finder: Call to Arms offers additional rewards for queuing as the currently least represented role. To be eligible for the additional rewards you must solo queue for a random level-85 Heroic in the role that is currently being Called to Arms, and complete the dungeon by killing the final boss. Every time you hit these requirements (there is no daily limit) you'll receive a goodie bag that will contain some gold, a chance at a rare gem, a chance at a flask/potion, a good chance of receiving a non-combat pet (including cross faction pets), and a very rare chance at receiving a mount.

GENERAL

 * Conquest is now purchasable from the Valor vendor at 250 Conquest per 250 Valor.

 * Justice is now purchasable from the Honor Commodities Vendor at 250 Justice per 375 Honor.
 * Resilience scaling has been modified for linear returns, as opposed to increasing returns. Under the new formula, going from 30 resilience to 40 resilience gives players the same increase to survivability as going from 0 to 10. Resilience now scales in the same way armor and magic resistances do. A player with 32.5% damage reduction from resilience in 4.0.6 should see their damage reduction unchanged in 4.1. Those with less than 32.5% will gain slightly. Those with more will lose some damage reduction, increasingly so as their resilience climbs.
 * A dead player can now be resurrected by targeting them using the Party or Raid Frame even if they have released. No more hunting for corpses.
 * Portals to each of the capital cities have returned to Dalaran and Shattrath City.

 * Rated Battlegrounds
    * The achievements to win 100 rated Battlegrounds have been renamed to " [Veteran of the Alliance]" and " [Veteran of the Horde]", and now award those titles.
    * Achievements to win 300 rated Battlegrounds have been added, awarding the "Warbound" and "Warbringer (title)" titles to the Alliance and Horde respectively.
   
   
 * Arathi Basin
    * The achievement " [We Had It All Along *cough*]" now requires the player to win Arathi Basin by 50 points or less, up from 10 points or less.

    * The achievement " [Jugger Not]" now requires the player to win The Battle for Gilneas by 100 points or less, up from 10 points or less.

 * Several persistent ground effects now display different visuals for hostile and friendly players. The following spells have the same visual effects for friendly players, but new alternate visuals for hostile players: [Ring of Frost], [Consecration], [Desecration], [Wild Mushroom], [Flare], [Ice Trap], [Power Word: Barrier], [Smoke Bomb], and [Hand of Gul'dan]. As a general rule, the alternate effects have a red tint or hue indicating they are created by an enemy player.

 DEATH KNIGHTS

 *  [Dark Simulacrum] now works on numerous additional spells in dungeon encounters.
 *  [Raise Ally] has been redesigned to be a battle resurrection, analogous to [Rebirth]. It is instant cast, but costs 50 Runic Power to use, and has a 10-minute cooldown. It shares the same global battle resurrection cap with Rebirth and Soulstone.
 * Talent Specializations
    * Blood
       * Blood Shield now only works while in [Blood Presence].
       *  [Death Strike] self-healing no longer generates threat.

       *  [Frost Strike] now deals 130% of weapon damage, up from 110%.
       *  [Howling Blast] damage has been increased by 20%. To compensate, the area-of-effect splash now does 50% of the single-target damage, down from 60%. The net result of this change leaves the area-of-effect damage roughly the same as 4.0.6 numbers. In addition, Howling Blast now has a facing requirement.

USER INTERFACE

 * Moved Video and Sound to a new “Options” screen.
 * Added a network category to the new Options screen and included the two network checkboxes.
    * The Network category contains the options "Optimize network for speed" and "Enable IPv6 when available". "Optimize network for speed" will be enabled by default, and will send packets more frequently at the cost of higher bandwidth. The higher bandwidth may lead to disconnects for some players who have limited bandwidth. Players getting disconnected frequently should try unchecking this box.
   
   
 * Visual Settings Updates
    * Removed the red bar preventing the overall graphics slider from going to ultra based on computer specs.
    * When a player moves the overall slider to a setting that would have previously been prevented, any option that can't go as high as that setting will get the warning icon with a tooltip explaining why it can't go higher. For example: a player sets the overall slider to Ultra and the water setting can only go to Fair. The water setting would automatically switch to Fair.
    * Support for DirectX 11 can now be found in the Advanced tab of the Options screen.
   
   
 * At the login screen:

ELEMENTAL BONDS

What was to be an auspicious event at the ancient World Tree Nordrassil has ended in tragedy. There, members of the Cenarion Circle and Earthen Ring, including former warchief Thrall, had gathered with the noble Dragon Aspects to unite their powers and restore Nordrassil for the good of Azeroth. Yet word has now spread that a shadowy Twilight's Hammer agent interrupted the ceremony and struck down Thrall with dark magics... casting his spirit into the four domains of the Elemental Plane. If these terrible rumors hold true, the Earthen Ring--indeed, all of Azeroth--has lost one of its greatest champions.

THE REGROWTH AND MOLTEN FRONT

Although the night elves and their allies repelled Ragnaros's initial invasion of Hyjal, their work on the sacred mount is far from over. Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage has gathered his comrades at the Sanctuary of Malorne within the newly healed Regrowth to invade Ragnaros's domain: the Firelands. Once inside the Elemental Plane, Hyjal's defenders hope to establish a permanent stronghold. Yet these plans have come under threat by a ferocious new elemental assault that has swept through the Regrowth. Despite this setback, Hyjal's protectors remain steadfast in their mission, for they know that it is in the molten heart of the Firelands that the fate of Mount Hyjal will be decided.

THE FIRELANDS

The time to strike at Ragnaros draws near. The battle to protect Mount Hyjal now rages in the depths of Ragnaros's smoldering realm. As territory is gained by Azeroth's defenders and they draw closer to the inner sanctums of the Firelands, a monumental task awaits. Ragnaros's lair--Sulfuron Keep--is closely guarded by his most loyal servants, including the traitorous Druids of the Flame and their mysterious leader. Yet the brave heroes who have ventured into this ash-choked domain cannot afford to shy away from any danger. The outcome of the battles that lie ahead will determine the very survival of Azeroth.

DRAGONWRATH, TARECGOSA'S REST

Uncertainty looms over the blue dragonflight's domain, the Nexus, as its members struggle to appoint a new leader. Split between the two likeliest successors--Kalecgos and Arygos--the flight has agreed to meet during a rare celestial event known as the Embrace in the hopes that a new Aspect will finally be chosen. The bronze dragon Anachronos, however, has detected something sinister at work around the Nexus, threatening to compromise the ceremony. If a hero does not rise to investigate these dark forces and uncover their intentions, Anachronos believes that Azeroth's doom is imminent.

GENERAL

 * New Daily Quests: The Regrowth and Molten Front
    * A large assortment of all-new daily quests and rewards are now available in Hyjal, where players can help the Guardians of Hyjal push back the allies of Ragnaros and establish a forward operating base in the Firelands! In order to partake in the Regrowth and Molten Front daily quests, players must have at least completed Mount Hyjal up to and including the quest [81] Aessina's Miracle. Once this quest has been completed, players should speak with Matoclaw in the Sanctuary of Malorne to take part in the Regrowth efforts.
   
   
 * New Quest Chain: Elemental Bonds
    * A New quest line is now available to level-85 Horde and Alliance characters, bringing brave adventurers to Thrall's aid. [85] The Call of the World-Shaman, the quest which will point players toward Thrall and [85] The Nordrassil Summit, can be obtained at the Earthshrines in Stormwind or Orgrimmar.
   
   
 * New Raid: The Firelands
    * Located within the Elemental Plane, the Firelands is an all-new 10- and 25-player raid featuring normal and Heroic difficulties! Battle-hardened veterans of the Horde and Alliance now have an opportunity to strike at Ragnaros the Firelord and his loyal servants by venturing into their domain via Sulfuron Spire in Mount Hyjal.
   
   
 * New Legendary Item: [Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest]
    * Steadfast raiders have an opportunity to embark on a series of quests to create an all-new legendary caster staff. In order to begin the process of assembling the staff, players must first kill a Molten Lord in the Firelands, or have completed any of the achievements [The Bastion of Twilight], [Blackwing Descent], or [Throne of the Four Winds]. Once any of these achievements have been unlocked, players can accept the quest [85] A Legendary Engagement from Ziradormi in Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar, or Coridormi atop the Wizard's Sanctum in Stormwind (players who have already completed any of these achievements are immediately eligible for this quest). Players who become eligible for the quest series by killing a Molten Lord in the Firelands will automatically receive the quest [85] Your Time Has Come, leading them to the start of the questline. The legendary item questline is only available to druids, mages, priests, shaman, and warlocks.
   
   
 * New User Interface Feature: Dungeon Journal
    * A host of dungeon information is now built into the user interface via the all-new Dungeon Journal. This feature can be accessed via a new button in the Navigation tray from anywhere in the world. Boss background story, encounter details, abilities, and loot can be viewed with the Dungeon Journal for all bosses which have been integrated into the new system (this includes bosses for all Cataclysm dungeons and raids). Additional dungeons are planned to be incorporated in future updates.
   
   
 * Recruit-A-Friend now awards bonus experience and free level grants to level 80, up from level 60.
 * Players with a copy of the original World of Warcraft who had not yet upgraded to The Burning Crusade have had their accounts upgraded to access the content and features of The Burning Crusade expansion at no additional cost.

ACHIEVEMENTS

 *  [Bear-ly Made It] (new achievement): Save all four prisoners before they are sacrificed in Zul'Aman on Heroic difficulty.

CLASSES
GENERAL

 * All healing critical strikes now heal for 2 times a normal heal (+100%), up from 1.5 times a normal heal (+50%).
 * Players are once again free to dance in combat (without causing graphic errors). Other animations, such as attacks, will take precedence over dancing. The dance animation will be suppressed until the higher priority animation is complete. Fun has been unnerfed.
 * Buffs
    * All class abilities which place a buff on friendly targets no longer generate any threat. This goes for raid-wide buffs like [Mark of the Wild] and [Power Word: Fortitude], as well as triggered effects such as [Blessed Resilience] or [Fingers of Frost], and single-target buffs like [Dark Intent] and [Hysteria]. The exception is buffs which directly cause healing or damage, such as [Thorns] or [Renew]. Abilities such as these still generate normal threat.
   
   
 * Crowd Control
    * Many crowd control abilities no longer cause creatures to attack players when they are cast. The creature will not attack the player when the crowd control wears off, and nearby creatures will not become hostile to the player either. However, if a visible player gets too close to the target creature, the creature will remember and attack the player when the crowd control effect wears off. The intent is to make it easier for dungeon groups to manage crowd control assignments and pulling packs of hostile NPCs. The abilities affected by this change are: [Hibernate], [Entangling Roots], [Wyvern Sting] (will still cause hostility when it begins to deal damage), [Freezing Trap], [Polymorph], [Repentance], [Shackle Undead], [Blind], [Hex], [Bind Elemental], [Banish], [Seduction].
   
   
 * Pets
    * The Aggressive pet stance has been removed and replaced with the Assist stance. This stance will cause the player's pet to attack the player's target. The pet will not change targets unless the master attacks a new target for a few seconds.
    * The Defensive pet stance will now only cause the player's pet to attack enemies which attack the pet or the master.
   
   
 * Spell Interrupts
    * When interrupted while casting a single-school spell such as [Mind Flay] or [Frostbolt], players will now be able to cast dual-school spells such as [Mind Spike] (Frost and Shadow schools) or [Frostfire Bolt] (Frost and Fire schools). However, being interrupted while casting a dual-school spell will still interrupt all respective schools as intended.
   
   
 * Stats
    * Death knights, paladins, and warriors no longer receive any bonus to their chance to dodge from Agility. Their base chance to dodge is now a fixed 5%.
    * Death knights, paladins, and warriors now receive 27% of their Strength bonuses as parry rating, up from 25%. This conversion still only applies to Strength above and beyond their base Strength.
   
   
 * General Class Bug Fixes
    * Players should no longer incorrectly receive a message stating they interrupted a spell cast when they did not.
    * Action bars will no longer briefly disappear when characters that have a stance bar enter a vehicle.
   
   

 DEATH KNIGHTS

 *  [Obliterate] base damage has been reduced to 150% weapon damage, down from 160%.
 * Talent Specializations
    * Frost
       *  [Hungering Cold] now has a 1.5-second cast time.
       *  [Might of the Frozen Wastes] now increases two-handed weapon damage by 3/7/10%, down from 4/8/12%.
      
      
    * Unholy
       *  [Unholy Might] now increases Strength by 20%, up from 5%.
      
      
   
   
 * Glyphs
    *  [Glyph of Dark Succor] has been redesigned. Rather than placing a 15% maximum health floor on [Death Strike] healing while in Frost or [Unholy Presence], it causes the next Death Strike within 15 seconds after killing a foe that yields experience or [Honor Points] to heal for at least 20% of the death knight's maximum health (still requires Frost or Unholy Presence).
   
   
 * Death Knight Bug Fixes
    * The talent [Killing Machine] can now properly be triggered from off-hand attacks as well as main-hand attacks.
   
   

 DRUIDS

 * Druids now gain 1 attack power per point of Strength, down from 2. They continue to gain 2 attack power per point of Agility while in [Cat Form] or [Bear Form]. In addition, Cat Form's scaling rate from gear upgrades was slower than other classes, which was causing them to fall behind in damage with higher item levels. To counter the Strength change and improve scaling, the following changes have been made. All numbers cited are for level-85 druids.
    *  [Ferocious Bite] damage has been increased by 15%. In addition, its base cost has been reduced to 25 energy and it can use up to 25 energy, for up to a 100% damage increase.
    *  [Mangle] (Cat) damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 540% weapon damage, up from 460%, and bonus damage has been lowered to 302.
    *  [Rake] initial damage on hit now deals the same damage as each periodic tick (and is treated the same for all combat calculations). Periodic damage now gains 14.7% of attack power per tick, up from 12.6%, and base damage per tick has been lowered from 557 to 56. There is a known issue with Rake's tooltip being incorrect from this change will be corrected in a future patch.
    *  [Ravage] damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 950% weapon damage, up from 850%, and bonus damage has been lowered to 532.
    *  [Savage Roar] now grants 80% increased damage to melee auto attacks, up from 50%. The Glyph of Savage Roar remains an unchanged bonus of 5% to that total.
    *  [Shred] damage at level 80 and above has been increased to 540% weapon damage, up from 450%, and bonus damage has been lowered to 302.
   
   
 *  [Entangling Roots] and the equivalent spell triggered by [Nature's Grasp] no longer deal damage.
 *  [Innervate] now grants an ally target 5% of his or her maximum mana over 10 seconds, but still grants 20% of the druid's maximum mana over 10 seconds when self-cast.
 *  [Omen of Clarity] clearcasting buff from now lasts 15 seconds, up from 8 seconds.
 *  [Starfire] damage has been increased by approximately 23%.
 *  [Swipe] (Cat) now deals 600% weapon damage at level 80 or higher, down from 670%.
 *  [Wrath] damage has been increased by approximately 23%.
 * Talent Specializations
    * Balance
       *  [Earth and Moon]'s duration has been increased to 15 seconds, up from 12.
       *  [Fungal Growth] spell visual effect has been updated to be less visually intrusive and more aesthetic.
       *  [Lunar Shower] has been redesigned. When casting [Moonfire], the druid gains Lunar Shower. Lunar Shower increases the direct damage done by Moonfire by 15/30/45%, and reduces the mana cost by 10/20/30%. This effect stacks up to 3 times and lasts 3 seconds. While under the effects of Lunar Shower, Moonfire generates 8 Solar Energy, and [Sunfire] generates 8 Lunar Energy. The amount of Lunar/Solar Energy gained does not change based on the number of points spent in the talent, or stacks of Lunar Shower. Those druids who wish to delay transition in or out of an [Eclipse] state should now cast the one of their two basic attacks which will not move the Eclipse bar (either [Starfire] or [Wrath]).
       *  [Solar Beam] has a new spell effect.
       *  [Wild Mushroom: Detonate] can now also trigger Earth and Moon, in addition to Starfire and Wrath.
      
      
    * Feral
       * Bear damage abilities were scaling too fast with higher gear levels compared to other tanks, so the following balance changes have been made. All the numbers cited are for level 85 characters; numbers will be lower for lower-level characters.
          *  [Faerie Fire (Feral)] base damage has been raised to 2950, up from 679. Attack power scaling has been decreased to 10.8%, down from 15%.
          *  [Maul] base damage has been raised to 35, up from 8. Attack power scaling has been decreased to 19%, down from 26.4%.
          *  [Pulverize] weapon damage percent has been decreased to 60%, down from 80%. Damage per Lacerate application has been increased to 1623, up from 361.

    * Restoration
       *  [Symbiosis] (Mastery) has been removed and replaced with Harmony. Harmony increases direct healing by an additional 10%, and casting direct healing spells grants an additional 10% bonus to periodic healing for 10 seconds. Each point of mastery increases each bonus by an additional 1.25%. [Healing Touch], [Nourish], [Swiftmend], and the initial heal from [Regrowth] are considered direct healing spells for the purposes of this Mastery. All other healing from druid spells is considered periodic.
      
      
   
   
 * Glyphs
    *  [Glyph of Berserk] duration increase is now 10 seconds, up from 5.

    * The 4-piece Balance druid tier 11 PvE set bonus, Astral Alignment, now provides a total of 15% critical strike chance with 3 charges, decreasing by 5% per charge, instead of 99% decreasing by 33% per charge. This change was made because the set bonus proved so valuable it was not possible to upgrade out of the set into tier 12. To compensate, changes have been made to Starfire and Wrath (listed at the top of the druid class section).
    * The 2-piece Restoration druid tier 11 PvE set bonus has been redesigned to work with the new Restoration druid mastery. Druids with this bonus now receive the bonus to Spirit while the Harmony mastery bonus to periodic healing is active.

Players will need to progress through the Hyjal Regrowth and Molten Front daily questing areas in order to unlock access to the full gamut of taming challenges.
    *  [Intervene] (Pet Tenacity) has been redesigned. The pet runs at high speed toward a group member, reducing the damage done by the next melee or ranged attack made against them equal to 50% of the pet's total health.
   
   

 MAGES

 *  [Arcane Blast] damage done has been reduced by 5%.

 *  [Spellsteal] mana cost has been increased by 100%.
 * Talent Specializations
    * Fire
       * When [Impact] spreads [Living Bomb], it will only be spread to two additional targets. The net effect is that if the mage's most recent Living Bomb target is the same as their Impact target, that target will no longer lose the Living Bomb effect. If Living Bomb is active on multiple targets when the Impact effect is cast, Living Bomb will remain active on the most recent Living Bomb target, and will be added to two other nearby targets.
      
      
    * Frost

In addition, Seal of Righteousness procs can now be critical effects.
 * Talent Specializations
    * Holy
       *  [Beacon of Light] can no longer be dispelled. In addition, it now transfers 100% of the heal from Holy Light, but still 50% of the heal from other spells.
       *  [Denounce] has been redesigned. It still reduces the mana cost of [Exorcism]. However, it no longer has a chance on Holy Shock of making Exorcism free and instant. Instead, it has a 50/100% chance to prevent the Exorcism target from causing critical effects for the next 6 seconds. This effect can be dispelled.
       *  [Holy Shock] mana cost has been decreased to 7% of base mana, down from 8%.
       * Illuminated Healing (Mastery) has been adjusted slightly so that if a paladin refreshes an existing copy of his or her own Illuminated Healing on a target, the new absorption amount will be added into the old absorption amount and the duration will be reset. The total absorption created can never exceed 1/3 of the casting paladin's health.
       *  [Infusion of Light] can now lower the cast time of Flash of Light by 0.75/1.5 seconds, in addition to Holy Light and Divine Light. In addition, the old Denounce spell overlay effect has been transferred to Infusion of Light since Denounce is no longer a proc.

       *  [Judgements of the Wise] now procs on attempt rather than on strike, which means judgements that miss can still grant mana. This is to help ensure Protection paladins are not starved for mana if they aren't capped on hit rating.
      
      
    * Retribution
       *  [Inquiry of Faith] now increases [Inquisition] duration by 66/133/200%, up from 50/100/150%.

When Water Shield is active, Resurgence causes critical direct heals to restore mana (Resurgence rank 2 is roughly equal to 150% of the old Improved Water Shield value when a [Healing Wave] or [Greater Healing Wave] critically hits, and scaled down accordingly for faster or multi-target spells).
       *  [Mana Tide Totem] now grants 200% of the caster's Spirit, down from 400%.

CURRENCY

 * Conquest & Honor Points
    * All existing [Conquest Points] in the Currency tab have been converted to [Honor Points]. All Honor Points exceeding the 4,000 point cap have been converted into gold at a rate of 35 silver per point and mailed to characters.
    * The minimum cap on Conquest Points earned per week from Arenas is now 1350 at 1500 or less Arena rating. The maximum cap is now 2700 at 3000 or more Arena rating. The cap continues to scale non-linearly between those two points. For comparison, during season 9 the cap ranged between 1343 and 3000.
    * The game now separately tracks different Conquest Point caps for Battlegrounds and Arenas. Battleground ratings receive a bonus of 22.2% to the cap they generate, meaning the cap from Battleground rating now ranges between 1650 and 3300. Players may earn a total number of Conquest Points per week equal to the higher of these two caps, but once players have reached the cap for either Arenas or Battlegrounds, they can no longer earn Conquest Points from that source. Conquest Points from Battleground holidays only count toward the total Conquest Point cap.
       * Example: During the first week of Season 10 everyone starts with a rating below 1500. Therefore, the cap from Rated Battlegrounds will be 1650 and the cap from Arena rating will be 1350. In the first week, the character wins enough Arena matches to reach the 1350 point cap. After that point, Arena wins will no longer grant Conquest points for the week. However, the character can still earn up to 300 additional points, but can only earn those points from either Rated Battlegrounds, or from the Conquest Point bonus for holiday and/or daily random Battlegrounds. The following week the cap will be recalculated based on the character's ratings, and it is possible Arena rating could now generate the higher cap. The second week, the character's cap from Arena rating is 1800, and the cap from Rated Battlegrounds is 1650. The character has a total cap of 1800 Conquest points for the week. Up to 1650 points can be earned from Rated Battlegrounds, but the last 150 must come from a different source.
      
      
   
   
 * Valor & Justice Points
    * All existing [Valor Points] in the Currency tab have been converted to [Justice Points]. Any points above the Justice Point cap will be converted into gold at a rate of 47 silver per point and mailed to characters.
    * The maximum number of Valor Points which can be earned in a week from any and all applicable dungeons and raids is now 980, down from 1250.
       * The maximum number of Valor Points awarded for completing Rise of the Zandalari dungeons remains at 980.
       * The maximum number of Valor Points awarded for completing Heroic dungeons remains at 490.
       * The number of Valor Points awarded for killing a boss in the Firelands is 120 in 10-player mode, and 140 in 25-player mode.
       * The number of Valor Points awarded for killing Occu'thar in Baradin Hold is 120 in 10-player mode, and 140 in 25-player mode.
       * The number of Valor Points awarded for killing a boss on Heroic difficulty in The Bastion of Twilight, Blackwing Descent, and Throne of the Four winds is 35 in 10-player mode, and 45 in 25-player mode.

 *  [Darkmoon Card: Hurricane] damage done when triggered has been increased by 40%, however, it can no longer deal critical strikes and no longer receives any modifiers to its damage from the equipping player.

 * PvP Items & Rewards
    * Applicable Season 9 items now cost Honor Points.
    * Gladiator Weapons
       * Season 10 Conquest Point weapons will only be purchasable once a required minimum sum of Conquest Points has been reached during the current season. For example, Ruthless Gladiator's Pike costs 3400 Conquest Points to purchase. However, players must first earn a total of 7800 Conquest Points during Season 10 before they are able to purchase it.
       * Season 9 Honor Point weapons will only be purchasable once a required minimum sum of Honor Points has been reached during the current season. For example, Vicious Gladiator's Pike costs 3400 Honor Points to purchase. However, players must first earn a total of 7250 Honor Points during Season 10 before they are able to purchase it.
       * Once the minimum sum of points required to purchase weapons is reached, all available weapons can be purchased for their listed costs. The point requirement is not reset once a purchase is made.
       * Weapon tooltips from the vendor will let players know how many more Conquest or Honor Points must be earned in the current season before the item can be purchased.
      
      
    * Rated Battleground Rewards
       * New PvP ground mounts, the Vicious War Wolf (Horde) and Vicious War Steed (Alliance), will be awarded to players for completing achievements to win 75, 150, and 300 Rated Battlegrounds respectively, rather than for being in the top .5% of the ladder at the end of each season as with Arenas. This award system is to better compliment the spirit of Battlegrounds. One account-bound mount will be awarded for each achievement unlocked, allowing players who obtain 150 and 300 Rated Battleground wins to earn this mount a second and third time. The additional mounts earned can then be sent to alt characters, given they're account-bound. These mounts are awarded as soon as an associated achievement is unlocked and do not correspond with end-of-season rewards.
      
      
    * Set Bonuses
       * The 2-piece resilience bonus from Cataclysm PvP sets no longer stacks. If a player wears 2 pieces each from 2 different Cataclysm sets, the player will only receive the 400 resilience rating bonus once. This change does not apply to PvP sets from prior expansions.

Eye of the Storm is otherwise still a 15-player Battleground with tug-of-war style capture points.
    * Warsong Gulch has been added back into the Rated Battleground rotation.
    * War Games
       * Many improvements have been made to the War Games interface. It now has its own panel for ease of use and raid/group leaders are the only ones who can challenge another group to War Games.

 * New Legendary Item: Fangs of the Father
    * The most deadly and experienced rogues will play a central role in the fate of the world the rogue’s way: by manipulating key events from the shadows. Players will travel across continents to accomplish crucial missions of reconnaissance, burglary, infiltration and, of course, assassination. Rogues who succeed will receive a paired set of daggers that will become increasingly lethal as their bearer progresses along the legendary quest. At the height of their strength, they will be imbued with the vile essence of the Old Gods, as well as the maddened fury of the Black Dragonflight -- bestowing great power upon their bearer. These powers include a stacking increase to Agility which builds until dark wings unfurl from the rogue’s back, removing the combo point cost and increasing damage of finishing moves for a short time. In addition, the wings which can be spread on command (with no combat benefit) to slow a rapid descent, allowing the rogue to slowly fall to the ground… or enact a little death from above!

CLASSES
GENERAL

 * Vengeance for Protection warriors, Protection paladins, Blood death knights, and Feral druids has been redesigned slightly. It no longer ramps up slowly at the beginning of a fight. Instead, the first melee attack taken by the tank generates Vengeance equal to 33% of the damage taken by that attack. In addition, as it updates periodically during the fight, it's always set to at least 33% of the damage taken by the tank in the last 2 seconds. It still climbs from that point at the rate it did previously, still decays when damage is not taken, and still cannot exceed a maximum based on the health and Stamina of the tank.
 * Threat generated by classes in active tanking modes has been increased to 500% damage done, up from 300%. This applies to druids in [Bear Form], death knights in [Blood Presence], warriors in [Defensive Stance], and paladins with [Righteous Fury] active.

TRIVIA

 * Patch 4.3 is the longest patch cycle between content releases in WoW history, lasting over ten months. 4.3 lasted, with few minor bug fix patches, from November 2011 until Mists of Pandaria was released in September of 2012. This extremely long dry streak had players very unsure of what Mists had to offer. This led to Blizzard releasing patches is a much faster fashion in MoP with a patch every 2-3 months and every other patch containing a raid.

      NEW RAID: SIEGE OF ORGRIMMAR
      
       * The tensions stoked by Garrosh Hellscream's arrogance have reached a boiling point with the devastation unleashed upon the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Now it's time for leaders of the Alliance and Horde to lay siege to Hellscream's capital and topple the ruthless Warchief once and for all!
       * Siege of Orgrimmar contains 14 new encounters across four expansive wings as members of the Horde and Alliance take the war directly to Garrosh's doorstep. 
          * Learn more about the new encounters in Patch 5.4 Raid Preview: Siege of Orgrimmar.

          * Information on the availability of each difficulty can be found in the Siege of Orgrimmar Raid Schedule.
         
         
      
      NEW FEATURE: FLEXIBLE RAID DIFFICULTY
      
       * This is a new raid difficulty designed for pre-made groups of 10 to 25 players or any number in between. This means it's possible to have raids of 15 or 22 players! Difficulty will adjust automatically based on the number of players present with encounters intended to provide a challenge roughly between Raid Finder and Normal difficulty.
       * Flexible Raid difficulty requires a pre-made group to join but has no minimum item level requirements or role restrictions. Both BattleTag™ and Real ID friends are eligible to participate.
       * Loot quality will be between Raid Finder and Normal difficulty and awarded through a personal loot system (similar to Raid Finder). Bonus rolls and loot specialization will also be supported.
       * Player spells with different target limits depending on raid size will gradually increase their limits based on the number of players in Flexible Raid difficulty.
       * Players will be able to earn raid achievements just like in Normal or Heroic difficulty.
       * Flexible Raid difficulty has a lockout that is separate from Raid Finder and Normal difficulty.
       * To learn more about Flexible Raids, please visit our blog titled: A Raid for All Seasons: Flexible Raid Preview.

       * The Timeless Isle is inhabited by all manner of strange and powerful creatures that will test the mettle of solo explorers, but great rewards await the brave and skillful: epic loot, bind-to-account gear, Mogu Runes of Fate, pets, mounts, fun toys, and much more.
       * The Isle is filled with secrets and mysteries, many of which dynamically become available to explorers. Keep an eye on your minimap while on the Isle for information on nearby events!
       * The Timeless Isle is home to five new world raid bosses! Players may face each of the four Celestials in a trial of combat.

       * To make Connected Realm feel seamless, player's home realms won't be indicated in the game world. In certain places, such as chat, the players' home realms will be displayed next to their name.
       * Learn more about this feature in our Patch 5.4 Feature Preview: Connected Realms.
      
      REDESIGNED ARENA SYSTEM
      
       * Players no longer need to create or join an Arena team to compete.
       * Similar to the Rated Battleground system, players in a party of the appropriate size (cross-realm groups are supported) may queue for an Arena bracket of the same size (2v2, 3v3, or 5v5).
       * Each player will have a personal rating that increase or decrease based on victories and defeats against other rated opponents. Opponents will be selected based on the average Match Making Rating of the party.
       * Conquest cap, requirements on gear and enchantments will be based on the player's personal rating.
       * The Arena ladder will no longer be sorted according to Battlegroup. Just like Rated Battlegrounds and normal Battlegrounds, all Arenas will now be region-wide!
       * At the end of an Arena season, the top players in a region will still earn titles and mounts.
       * For more details about the change to Arenas, please see the blog titled: Patch 5.4 Arena Update.

          * Vengeance gains from being critically hit have been reduced by 50%.
          * There are now diminishing returns on Vengeance gains while tanking multiple targets. Each additional target grants progressively less Vengeance.
          * So as not to affect Challenge Mode leader boards, the above Vengeance changes will not apply there. For Challenge Modes, Vengeance will continue to work as it did in patch 5.3.
         
         
       * Area knockback effects now all share a diminishing return category. After a player has been moved by one of these spells, the player will be immune for 10 seconds. This new category applies to: [Fellash], [Gorefiend's Grasp], [Glyph of Explosive Trap], [Thunderstorm], [Typhoon], [Ursol's Vortex], and [Whiplash].

       *  [Soul of the Forest] has been partially redesigned to make it more attractive to Balance, Guardian, and Restoration Druids. 
          * Balance: Wrath, [Starfire], and [Starsurge] casts have a 8% chance to cause [Astral Communion] to grant 100 Lunar Power or Solar Power instead of activating the next Eclipse.

    *  INTRODUCTION
      
      The Dark Portal in the Blasted Lands has turned blood red. Hundreds of strange-looking orcs are violently pouring into Azeroth, killing everything that stands in their path. Nethergarde and Okril’lon have already fallen, and while the Horde and the Alliance moved as quickly as they could to get reinforcements to their people, they are too late. The Iron Horde invasion has begun.
      
      
      In this desperate hour, King Wrynn and Warchief Vol’jin have called upon their greatest champions to join the front lines in the Blasted Lands and do whatever they can to stop the Iron Horde...before the rest of Azeroth falls before them.
      
      
      Prepare yourself. Draenor is waiting.

      CHARACTER AND CLASS CHANGES
      
      Welcome to a look at character and class changes. We're trying a new patch note format, which we hope will help better convey the reasoning for many of the changes being made and what they mean for you, while providing more background into issues we're trying to solve.
      
      
      Looking for a TL;DR summary of the character and class changes? Here you go!
      
      
       * Character stats have been squished into smaller numbers that are easier to understand. It's important to understand that this is not a nerf as enemies' stats have been squished as well.
       * Balanced functionality of Agility, Strength and Intellect.
       * New secondary stats: Bonus Armor, Multistrike, and Versatility.
       * Hit and Expertise have been removed; they're no longer needed in order to reliably land attacks!
       * The pacing of healing has been adjusted to allow for more tactical decision-making regarding efficiency and throughput, on both single-target and multi-target heals. Passive and auto-targeted healing have been reduced in effectiveness in order to emphasize the actions and choices of healers.
       * Racial traits have been rebalanced so that all races have similar combat performance.
       * All classes have had several abilities pruned, with a focus on redundant and less-used abilities to cut down on button and keybind bloat.
       * Amount of crowd-control in the game (primarily PvP) has been drastically reduced. Many crowd-control abilities have been removed, and many diminishing returns categories have been merged together.
       * Several common buffs and debuffs have been merged, or removed, where they were redundant.
       * All characters now learn some important Major Glyphs automatically as they level up.
       * Toned down the amount of instant healing in the game by giving cast times to several instant cast heals.
       * For tanks, Vengeance has been redesigned and renamed Resolve. 
          *  [Resolve] does not increase outgoing damage, but does now increase tank self-healing and absorption based on damage taken.
         
         
       * Facing requirements (character positioning) on some prominent abilities have been loosened or removed.
       * Reduced mana cost of resurrection spells to make it a little easier to recover from a wipe.
       * Professions no longer have combat benefit perks tied to them.
       * A multitude of class-specific changes, things like improved distinction between different talent specializations, and new Masteries. Please consult class-specific sections below for more information.
      
      STAT SQUISH
      
      Character progression is one of the defining characteristics of a role-playing game. Naturally, that means that we're continuously adding more power to the game for players to acquire. After 4 expansions and over 9 years of this growth, we've gotten to a point where the numbers involved are no longer easy to grasp. And worse, much of the granularity that's available is tied up in tiers of older content from Molten Core to Dragon Soul, none of which are really relevant anymore. It's no longer necessary for Borean Tundra quest gear to be nearly twice as powerful as Netherstorm quest gear, even though the two zones are only a couple of levels apart.
      
      
      In order to bring things down to an understandable level, we've reduced the scale of stats throughout the game, back to as if they continued scaling linearly through questing content from levels 1 to 90. This applies to creatures, spells, abilities, consumables, gear, other items... everything. Your stats and damage have been reduced by a huge amount, but so have creatures' health. For example, your [Fireball] that previously hit a creature for 450,000 out of its 3,000,000 health (15% of its health), may now hit that same creature for 30,000 out of its 200,000 health (still 15% of its health). In effect, you will still be just as powerful, but the numbers that appear will be more easily parsed.
      
      
      It's important to understand that this isn't a nerf, and we have special handling in place to preserve players' existing ability to solo old content. Players will deal bonus damage against lower-level creatures from past expansions, and will take reduced damage from them.
      
      
      We've also removed all base damage on player spells and abilities, and adjusted Attack Power or Spell Power scaling as needed, so that all specializations will scale at the same rate.
      
      
       * The amount of stats on items has been reduced to be much lower than before.
       * Creature stats have been reduced to compensate.
      
      
      We've also streamlined the multitude of various types of Haste % and Critical Strike % bonuses.
      
      
       * Spell Haste %, Melee Haste %, and Ranged Haste % have been merged into a universal Haste %.
       * Spell Crit %, Melee Crit %, and Ranged Crit % have been merged into a universal Crit %.
      
      PRIMARY CHARACTER STATS AND ATTACK POWER
      
      The "primary" stats, Agility, Strength, and Intellect, are foundations of a character's power. But they have not been created equally, making it difficult to properly balance them against secondary stats. The leading reason for this is that Agility and Intellect also provide Critical Strike chance, in addition to Attack Power or Spell Power, whereas Strength does not. In order to achieve better balance, we've removed the Critical Strike chance increase from Agility and Intellect. Still, it felt like Agility-based characters should critically strike more often, so we've raised those classes' baseline Critical Strike chance to compensate.
      
      
       * Agility no longer provides an increased chance to critically strike with melee and ranged attacks or abilities.
       * Intellect no longer provides an increased chance to critically strike with spells.
       * The base chance to critically strike is now 5% for all classes. There are no longer different chances to critically strike with melee, ranged, and spells.
       * There is a new passive, named Critical Strikes, which increases chance to critically strike by 10%. 
          * It is learned by all rogues, all hunters, Feral and Guardian druids, Brewmaster and Windwalker monks, and Enhancement shaman.
         
         
      
      
      We've consolidated the way that Attack Power and Spell Power function and scale, to make those values clearer and correct some scaling issues regarding caster weapons relative to physical weapons.
      
      
       * Each point of Agility or Strength now grants 1 Attack Power (down from 2). All other sources of Attack Power now grant half as much as before.
       * Weapon Damage values on all weapons have been reduced by 50%.
       * Attack Power now increases Weapon Damage at a rate of 1 DPS per 3.5 Attack Power (up from 1 DPS per 14 Attack Power).
       * Attack Power, Spell Power, or Weapon Damage now affect the entire healing or damage throughput of player spells.
      
      
      Active mitigation has worked very well as a tanking model. So, moving forward we want to keep the amount of Dodge and Parry on tanks on the low side. This helps prevent encounters from causing very spiky damage on tanks, which generally isn't much fun. Dodge and Parry gains from Strength and Agility are being reduced to help accomplish this. Additionally, items in Warlords of Draenor will not have Dodge or Parry on them as a stat. Some Dodge and Parry can still be gained through class-specific effects.
      
      
       * The amount of Dodge gained per point of Agility has been reduced by 25%.
       * The amount of Parry gained per point of Strength has been reduced by 25%.
      
      ITEMIZATION CHANGES
      
      We're making a number of changes to itemization based on a single philosophy: We want to increase the chance that any given item drop is useful to someone in your group. To support this philosophy we're making a few changes to stats. Most items found in Draenor will work for all specializations within a given class, so that you never have to grumble when you see, for example, Intellect plate drop in a group that lacks a Holy paladin.
      
      
      We're also reducing the number of role-specific stats: Hit and Expertise are gone, as are Dodge and Parry as stats on items, replaced with a single tank stat of Bonus Armor. Armor and Spirit will be specific to tanks and healers respectively, but all other secondary stats will have universal appeal.
      
      
      Because of the magnitude of this change, we're retroactively applying this philosophy to items in Mists of Pandaria. After the pre-expansion patch you may find that some of your items contribute different stats, but they should still be good for your class.
      
      
      New secondary stats added
      
      
       * Bonus Armor: Increases Armor and Attack Power for tanking specializations.
       * Multistrike: Grants a chance for spells and abilities to fire up to 2 additional times, at 30% effectiveness (both damage and healing).
       * Versatility: Increases damage, healing, and absorption done. Reduces damage taken.
      
      
      Mists of Pandaria and future items
      
      
       * Dodge and Parry have been replaced with Bonus Armor. If an item had both Dodge and Parry on it, it has been replaced with an additional useful secondary stat.
       * Head, Chest, Hand, Wrist, Waist, Leg, Feet, Weapon, Shield, and Off-hand items that had tanking stats (Dodge, Parry) or healer stats (Spirit) have been replaced with a different universally useful secondary stat.
      
      
      Warlords of Draenor and future items
      
      
       * Plate Armor pieces will always have Strength and Intellect on it.
       * Mail and Leather Armor pieces will always have Agility and Intellect on it.
      
      
      In an effort to reduce the physical mitigation of some classes, we've modified the amount of Armor provided by some armor types.
      
      
       * Plate, Mail, and Shields now have less Armor relative to Cloth and Leather armor.
      
      HIT AND EXPERTISE REMOVAL
      
      Hit and Expertise were not fun stats. They acted to remove a penalty, instead of making you stronger. Most players treated Hit/Expertise caps as mandatory (rightfully so), with failure to reach those caps as a trap of sorts. After adjusting, gemming, and reforging gear to meet that cap, players could then go after the actual damage-increasing stats. We decided to remove Hit and Expertise, and make it so you don't need them. We still want melee specializations to attack creatures from behind when possible, so attacks from the front will have a 3% chance to be parried that cannot be eliminated for non-tanking specializations.
      
      
       * General 
          * Hit and Expertise has been removed as a secondary stat.
          * Hit and Expertise bonuses on all items and item enhancements (gems, enchants, etc.) have been converted into Critical Strike, Haste, or Mastery.
          * All characters now have a 100% chance to hit, 0% chance to be dodged, 3% chance to be parried, and 0% chance for glancing blows, when fighting creatures up to 3 levels higher (bosses included).
          * Tanking specializations receive an additional 3% reduction in chance to be parried. Tank attacks now have a 0% chance to be parried vs. creatures up to 3 levels higher.
          * Creatures that are 4 or more levels higher than the character still have a chance to avoid attacks in various ways, to discourage fighting enemies that are much stronger.
          * Dual Wielding still imposes a 19% chance to miss, to balance it with two-handed weapon use.
         
         
       * Death Knight 
          *  [Veteran of the Third War] now also reduces the chance for attacks to be parried by 3%.
         
         
       * Druid 
          *  [Balance of Power] has been removed. A new level-100 talent with the same name has been added.
          *  [Nature's Focus] no longer increases the chance to hit with [Moonfire] and [Wrath].
          *  [Thick Hide] now also reduces the chance for attacks to be parried by 3%.
         
         
       * Monk 
          *  [Stance of the Wise Serpent] no longer increases Hit or Expertise.
          *  [Stance of the Sturdy Ox] now also reduces the chance for attacks to be parried by 3%.
         
         
       * Priest 
          *  [Divine Fury] has been removed.
          *  [Spiritual Precision] has been removed.
         
         
       * Paladin 
          *  [Holy Insight] no longer increases the chance to hit with spells.
          *  [Sanctuary] now also reduces the chance for attacks to be parried by 3%.
         
         
       * Shaman 
          *  [Elemental Precision] has been removed.
          *  [Spiritual Insight] no longer increases the chance to hit with [Lightning Bolt], [Lava Burst], [Hex], or [Flame Shock].
         
         
       * Warrior 
          *  [Unwavering Sentinel] now also reduces the chance for attacks to be parried by 3%.
         
         
      
      SECONDARY STAT ATTUNEMENTS
      
      A new concept that we're introducing is each specialization having an attunement to a particular secondary stat. These take the form of a passive ability that grants a 5% increase to the amount of a specific secondary stat gained. This provides a good starting point for where to focus your secondary stats. Usually, it will be your highest throughput stat (not counting Spirit for Healers, and Bonus Armor for Tanks, which is an optimal secondary stat in most cases). There are exceptions, and raw throughput may not even be the biggest concern in some situations. Treat this as a guideline, not a rule, about which secondary stat to favor.
      
      
       * All specializations now receive a 5% bonus to specific secondary stat bonuses received from all sources. This bonus is granted through new passive abilities or additional effects added to existing passive abilities.

      PLAYER HEALTH AND RESILIENCE
      
      We're planning several interconnected changes designed to provide better-tuned gameplay for healers and improve the healing dynamic in PvP.
      
      
      The high amount of base Resilience and Battle Fatigue in Mists of Pandaria caused characters to feel much weaker in PvP than they did in PvE. To address this disparity, we're approaching Warlords of Draenor with the goal of shrinking that gap as much as possible. To reduce dependence on Resilience, we needed to increase player survivability against other players, and we chose to do this by essentially doubling (post-squish) player health.
      
      
      On its own, that increase in health would make players more survivable in the world at large, so we're also increasing creature damage and the effectiveness of healing spells to balance things out. The net result of these changes is that individual attacks will knock a smaller chunk off of a player's health pool in PvP, but your survivability in PvE remains unaffected.
      
      
      Doubling player health gave us room to reduce Resilience and Battle Fatigue, but our goal was to be able to remove them entirely. In order to achieve that, we're also reducing PvP spike damage across the board by lowering Critical Damage and Critical Heals against players in PvP to 150% of their normal effect (down from 200%). The changes have allowed us to reduce Base Resilience to 0%, and [remove Battle Fatigue].[1]
      
      
      Changes to PvP
      
      
       * Base Resilience has been reduced to 0%.
       * Battle Fatigue has been [removed].[1]
       * Critical Damage and Critical Heals in PvP combat now deal 150% of the normal spell/ability effects (down from 200%).
      
      
      Changes to Health Pools
      
      
       * Amount of health gained per Stamina point has been doubled. The curve on this calculation has been smoothed out as well, so exact amount varies slightly by level.
       * Maximum mana has been doubled at all levels to keep pace with expected increases to maximum health from new Stamina values.
       * All consumables now restore twice as much health and mana.
       * All creatures had their melee damage doubled. Most creature spells and abilities have had their damage doubled as well.
       * All player-cast healing and absorption effects have been increased by approximately 50% in effectiveness. If they heal or absorb a percentage of maximum health, they are instead reduced by 25%. All other noted changes are in terms relative to that. 
          * For example, if another noted change is that "Mega Heal now heals for 40% more," that means that Mega Heal now heals for a total of 210% of what it used to, which is relatively 40% higher compared to other heals.
         
         
      
      RETUNING HEALING SPELLS
      
      One of our goals for healing is to tone down the raw throughput of healers relative to the size of player health pools. Currently, as healers and their allies acquire better and better gear, the percentage of a player's health that any given heal restores increases significantly. As a result, healers are able to refill health bars so fast that we have to make damage more and more "bursty" in order to challenge them. Ideally, we want players to spend some time below full health without having healers feel like their groupmates are in danger of dying at any moment. We also think that healer gameplay would be more varied, interesting, and skillful if your allies spent more time between 0% and 100%, rather than just getting damaged quickly to low health, forcing the healer to then scramble to get them back to 100% as quickly as possible.
      
      
      To that end, we're buffing heals less than we're increasing player health. Heals will be deliberately less potent compared to health pools than before the item squish. Additionally, as gear improves, the scaling rates of health and healing will now be very similar, so the relative power of any given healing spell shouldn't climb so much over the course of this expansion. For those concerned about what this means for raiding, don't worry—we're taking all of these changes into account when designing Raid content for Warlords of Draenor.
      
      
      It's also important to note that spells that heal based on a percentage of maximum health are being effectively buffed by the massive increase to player health pools, so we're lowering those percentages to offset the effect. That may make them appear to have been nerfed—however, the net result is that those percentage-based heals stay about the same as before relative to other heals.
      
      
      All of these changes apply to damage-absorption shields as well. Additionally, we're toning down the power of damage absorption in general. When they get too strong, absorption effects are often used in place of direct healing, instead of as a way to supplement it. We will, of course, take these changes into account when tuning specializations that rely heavily on absorbs, such as Discipline Priests.
      
      
      We also took a look at healing spells that were passive or auto-targeted (so-called "smart" heals). We want healers to care about who they're targeting and which heals they're using, so that their decisions matter more. To that end, we're reducing the healing of many passive and auto-targeted heals, and making smart heals a little less smart. Smart heals will now randomly pick any injured target within range instead of always picking the most injured target. Priority will still be given to players over pets, of course.
      
      
      Another of our goals for healing in this expansion is to strike a better balance between single-target and multi-target healing spells. We've taken a close look at the mana efficiency of our multi-target heals, and in many cases, we're reducing their efficiency, usually by reducing the amount they heal. Sometimes, but more rarely, raising their mana cost was a better decision. We want players to use multi-target heals, but they should only be better than their single-target equivalents when they heal more than two players without any overhealing. This way, players will face a meaningful choice between whether to use a single-target heal or a multi-target heal based on the situation.
      
      
      Finally, we're removing the low-throughput, low-mana-cost heals like [Nourish], [Holy Light], [Heal], and [Healing Wave], because we think that while they do add complexity, they don't truly add depth to healing gameplay. (We're also renaming some spells to re-use those names. For example, [Greater Healing Wave] is being redubbed Healing Wave.) However, we still want healers to think about their mana when deciding which heal to cast, and so the mana costs and throughputs of many spells are being altered to give players a choice between spells with lower throughput and lower cost versus spells with higher throughput and higher costs. Here are some examples from each healer class.
      
      Class Higher efficiency Higher throughput Druid [Healing Touch], [Rejuvenation], [Efflorescence] [Regrowth], [Wild Growth] Monk [Soothing Mist], [Renewing Mist] [Surging Mist], [Spinning Crane Kick] Paladin [Holy Light], [Holy Shock], [Word of Glory], [Light of Dawn] [Flash of Light], [Holy Radiance] Priest [Greater Heal], [Circle of Healing], [Prayer of Mending], [Holy Nova] (new Discipline-only version), [Penance] [Flash Heal], [Prayer of Healing] Shaman [Healing Wave], [Riptide], [Healing Rain] [Healing Surge], [Chain Heal] 
      All of this discussion of efficiency may cause most healers to start worrying about mana regeneration and their mana pool. To allay those concerns, we've increased base mana regeneration a great deal at early gear levels, while having it scale up less at later gear levels. This will make all of these changes play well even in early content such as Heroic Dungeons and the first tier of Raid content, and also play well in the final Raid tier without mana and efficiency becoming irrelevant due to extremely high regeneration values.
      
      
      That's a lot of big changes for healers: reduced throughput, a more deliberate pace, less powerful "smart" heals, weaker absorbs, fewer spells, and a new focus on efficiency decisions. We're confident that we can apply lessons learned from previous expansions to make this the best healer experience yet: more dynamic, less punishing, and frankly a lot more fun.
      
      
      General Changes to Healing
      
      
       * Smart heals will now randomly pick any injured target within range, instead of always picking the most injured target. Priority will still be given to players over pets.
       * Long-cast-time single-target heals, such as [Greater Heal] and [Healing Touch], now cost roughly half as much as fast-cast-time single-target heals, such as [Flash of Light] or [Healing Surge], and heal for roughly the same amount.
       * Every class has multiple area healing spells available, some low throughput and efficient, others high throughput and inefficient.
       * Area healing spells are tuned to be less efficient than single-target healing spells when they heal 2 or fewer targets, and more efficient when they heal 3 or more targets.
       * Spells with cooldowns or limitations may have higher efficiency than the no-cooldown equivalents.
      
      RACIAL TRAITS
      
      We want races to have fun and interesting perks, but if those traits are too powerful, players may feel compelled to play a specific race even if it doesn't suit their aesthetic preference. For example, trolls' [Berserking] ability was extremely powerful, and their [Beast Slaying] passive was often irrelevant, but occasionally tremendously powerful compared to other racial passives. On the other end of the spectrum, many races had few or no performance affecting perks. We also needed to replace or update a number of racials that previously granted Hit or Expertise, since those stats have been removed.
      
      
      We decided to bring down the couple high outliers, then establish a fair baseline and bring everyone else up to that. We achieved that by improving old passives, replacing obsolete ones, and occasionally adding new ones where needed. Our goal with these changes is to reach parity amongst races.
      
      
       * Blood elf 
          *  [Arcane Acuity] is a new racial passive ability that increases Critical Strike chance by 1%.
          *  [Arcane Torrent] now restores 20 Runic Power for death knights (up from 15 Runic Power), 1 Holy Power for paladins, or 3% of mana for mages, priests, and warlocks (up from 2% of mana). Other parts of the ability remain unchanged.
         
         
       * Draenei 
          *  [Gift of the Naaru] now heals for the same amount over 5 seconds (down from 15 seconds).
          *  [Heroic Presence] has been redesigned. It no longer increases Hit by 1%, and instead increases Strength, Agility, and Intellect, scaling with character level.
         
         
       * Dwarf 
          *  [Crack Shot] has been removed (was 1% Expertise with ranged weapons).

          *  [Might of the Mountain] is a new racial passive ability that increases Critical Strike bonus damage and healing dealt by 2%.
          *  [Stoneform] now also removes magic and curse effects in addition to poison, disease, bleed effects, and reduces physical damage taken by 10% for 8 seconds (down from all damage taken). It remains unusable while the dwarf is under the effects of crowd control.
         
         
       * Gnome 
          *  [Expansive Mind] now increases maximum mana, energy, rage, and Runic Power by 5% instead of only increasing maximum mana.
          *  [Escape Artist]'s cooldown has been reduced to 1 minute (down from 1.5 minutes).
          *  [Nimble Fingers] is a new racial passive ability that increases Haste by 1%.
          *  [Shortblade Specialization] (was 1% Expertise with one-handed swords and daggers) has been replaced with Nimble Fingers.
         
         
       * Goblin 
          *  [Time is Money] now grants a 1% increase to Haste (up from only attack speed and spell haste).
         
         
       * Human 
          *  [Mace Specialization] has been removed (was 1% Expertise with maces).
          *  [Sword Specialization] has been removed (was 1% Expertise with swords).
          *  [The Human Spirit] has been redesigned. It now increases Versatility, scaling with character level.
         
         
       * Night elf 
          *  [Quickness] now also increases movement speed by 2% in addition to increasing Dodge chance by 2%.
          *  [Touch of Elune] is a new passive ability which increases Haste by 1% at night, and Critical Strike chance by 1% during the day.
         
         
       * Orc 
          *  [Axe Specialization] has been removed (was 1% Expertise with axes).
          *  [Command] now increases pet damage by 1% (down from 2%).

          *  [Berserking] now increases Haste by 15% (down from 20%).
          *  [Beast Slaying] now increases XP earned from killing Beasts by 20%, instead of increasing damage dealt versus Beasts by 5%.
          *  [Dead Eye] has been removed (was 1% Expertise with ranged weapons).
         
         
       * Undead 
          *  [Will of the Forsaken]'s cooldown has been increased to 3 minutes (up from 2 minutes).
          * Undead can now breathe underwater indefinitely.
         
         
      
      ABILITY PRUNING AND CONSOLIDATION
      
      Over the years, we've added significantly more new spells and abilities to the game than we've removed. This has led to the complexity of the game increasing steadily over time, to the point we're at now, where players feel like they need dozens of keybinds. There are many niche abilities which could theoretically be useful in some rare case, but usually are not. There are many abilities that we'd be better off not having. We decided that we needed to make a strong push for paring down the number of abilities each class/spec has. That means making some abilities restricted to certain specs that really need them instead of being class-wide, and outright removing some other abilities. It also includes removing some Spellbook clutter, such as passives that could be merged with others, or with base abilities.
      
      
      However, this doesn't mean that we want to reduce the depth of gameplay, or "dumb it down." We still want there to be interesting decisions during combat, and for skill to matter. But, that doesn't require complexity; we can remove some needless complexity and still retain the depth and skill variance.
      
      
      One type of ability that we focused on is temporary power buffs ("cooldowns"). Removing those also helps achieve one of our other goals, which is to reduce the amount of cooldown stacking in the game. In cases where a class/spec had multiple cooldowns that typically ended up getting used together, often in a single macro, we merged them, or removed some of them.
      
      
      What abilities and spells got cut is a very, very difficult question to answer. Every ability is vital to someone, so we don't take this process lightly. We hope that even if we cut your favorite ability, you can see it in the context of our larger goals. It's important to remember that the point of these changes is to increase players' ability to understand the game, not to reduce depth of gameplay. We attempt to prune abilities with the intent to reduce the amount of keybind/macro bloat and merging abilities that served a similar purpose but are otherwise redundant together.
      
      
       * Additional changes 
          * Revised the levels at which class abilities are learned to provide a smoother leveling experience.
         
         
      
      
      Please see the classes section for changes specific to each class.
      
      CROWD CONTROL AND DIMINISHING RETURNS
      
      Another big takeaway from Mists of Pandaria is that there was simply too much crowd control (CC) in the game. To solve that, we knew that we needed an across-the-board disarmament. Here's a summary of the player-cast CC changes:
      
      
       * Removed Silence effects from all Interrupts. Silences still exist, but are never attached to an Interrupt.
       * Removed all Disarms.
       * Reduced the number of Diminishing Returns (DR) categories. 
          * All Roots now share the same DR category. 
             * Exception: Roots on 'Charge' types of abilities have no DR category, but have a very short duration instead.
            
            
          * All Stuns now share the same DR category.
          * All Incapacitate ("Mesmerize") effects now share the same DR category, and have been merged with the Horror DR category.
          * A list of which Diminishing Returns category each crowd-control ability belongs to can be found in the forum thread titled: Diminishing Returns in Warlords of Draenor.
         
         
       * Removed the ability to make crowd-control spells with cast times into instant-cast with a cooldown.
       * Removed many crowd-control spells entirely, and increased the cooldowns and restrictions on others. 
          * Pet-cast CC is more limited and often removed.
          *  [Cyclone] can now be dispelled by Immunity effects and Mass Dispel.
          * PvP trinkets now grant immunity to reapplication of an effect from the same spell cast when they break abilities with persistent effects like [Solar Beam].
          * Long fears are now shorter in PvP, to account for the target also needing to run back afterward.
         
         
      
      
      Additionally, we've significantly reduced the number of throughput-increasing cooldowns and procs, in order to further reduce burst damage. Please keep in mind when reading the specifics of the patch notes that some classes may have lost abilities, or had the power of select abilities reduced. These changes were made in the context of the above goals. Other classes have a reduced crowd-control ability overall. We believe that this entire package of changes will make PvP a more enjoyable experience for everyone.

      MOVEMENT SPEED
      
      Moving quickly has always been a powerful bonus in World of Warcraft; however, the logic of how various movement speed bonuses stack (or don't) has generally been inconsistent and poorly explained. Under the old set-up, each movement speed bonus would become more powerful when combined with another, so we would limit what can stack with what, and prevent certain abilities from being used when another one is already in effect. We decided to change the movement speed system to make it more transparent, with rules about stacking that are easier to understand, and with fewer restrictions.
      
      
      Previously, multiple movement speed modifiers on you were multiplicative, meaning that if you had two different +25% movement speed bonuses, they resulted in a total movement speed of 56% (1.25*1.25 = 1.56).
      
      
      Movement speed bonuses have been changed to be additive. The previous example with two different +25% movement speed bonuses would result in a total movement speed of +50%. The logic governing which bonuses stack with others has been simplified as well.
      
      
       * Movement speed buffs that are self-only or is a passive effect are considered non-exclusive, and will now all stack together additively.
       * Movement speed buffs that are temporary or could be applied to other players are considered exclusive, their effects do not stack, and only the highest bonus gets applied (in addition to non-exclusive movement speed buffs).
      
      
      Additionally, restrictions that prevented a player with a temporary speed bonus from receiving or activating a second temporary speed bonus have been removed. Both bonuses will now apply to the character, but only the one with the highest magnitude will have any effect.
      
      
      Examples of self-only passive bonuses: [Cat Form], Movement Speed enchants, [Quickness] racial for Night Elves, [Unholy Presence]
      
      
       * These will all stack additively with each other.
      
      
      Examples of shared or temporary bonuses: [Angelic Feather], [Sprint], Stampeding Roar
      
      
       * All of these effects can now be applied simultaneously, but only the strongest one will have an effect.
      
      BUFFS AND DEBUFFS
      
      All specializations provide some common buffs and debuffs. These are important to the game because they encourage cooperation, make you stronger when you work together with others, and promote raid composition diversity. However, we saw room to revise these buffs and debuffs. In addition to the above changes, we revised which buffs and debuffs are provided by Hunter pets. Please see the Hunter Pet Abilities section for a full list of changes.
      
      
      Two new stats have been added that benefitted all players. Also added were three new debuffs (Weakened Armor, Physical Vulnerability, and Magic Vulnerability) that each benefitted only half of the group. While that could be interesting, the two physical debuffs were redundant, and felt that the two new stats would be better suited as raid buffs. So, we made that replacement.
      
      
       * Weakened Armor, Physical Vulnerability, and Magic Vulnerability 
          * Death Knight (Frost): [Brittle Bones] has been removed.
          * Death Knight (Unholy): [Ebon Plaguebringer] no longer causes Physical Vulnerability.
          * Druid: [Faerie Fire] no longer applies Weakened Armor.
          * Paladin (Retribution): [Judgments of the Bold] no longer causes Physical Vulnerability.
          * Rogue: [Expose Armor] no longer applies Weakened Armor.
          * Rogue: [Master Poisoner] has been removed.
          * Warlock: [Curse of the Elements] has been removed.
          * Warrior: [Sunder Armor] no longer applies Weakened Armor.
          * Warrior (Arms, Fury): [Colossus Smash] no longer causes Physical Vulnerability.
          * Warrior (Protection): [Devastate] no longer applies Weakened Armor.
         
         
       * Versatility 
          * Death Knight (Frost, Unholy): [Unholy Aura] now also provides 3% Versatility.
          * Druid: [Mark of the Wild] now also provides 3% Versatility.
          * Paladin (Retribution): [Sanctity Aura] is a new passive ability for Retribution paladins which grants 3% Versatility to the paladin and all allies within 100 yards.
          * Warrior (Arms, Fury): [Inspiring Presence] is a new passive ability for Arms and Fury warriors which grants 3% Versatility to the warrior and all allies within 100 yards.
         
         
       * Multistrike 
          * Monk (Windwalker): [Windflurry] is a new passive ability for windwalker Monks which grants 5% Multistrike to the monk and all allies within 100 yards.
          * Priest (Shadow): [Mind Quickening] now also grants 5% Multistrike.
          * Rogue: [Swiftblade's Cunning] now also grants 5% Multistrike.
          * Warlock: [Dark Intent] now grants 5% Multistrike instead of 10% Stamina. 
             *  [Blood Pact] is a new passive ability for warlocks which grants 10% Stamina to the warlock and all allies within 100 yards.
            
            
         
         
      
      
      Weakened Blows was a debuff that mattered almost exclusively to tanks, and that every tank automatically applied. We removed the debuff and reduced creature damage to compensate.
      
      
       * Weakened Blows 
          * The following abilities no longer apply the Weakened Blows effect. 
             * Death knight (Blood): [Scarlet Fever]
             * Druid: [Thrash] (Bear Form); [Thrash] (Cat Form)
             * Monk: [Keg Smash]
             * Paladin: [Crusader Strike]; [Hammer of the Righteous]
             * Shaman: [Earth Shock]
             * Warrior: [Thunder Clap]
            
            
         
         
      
      
      The Cast Speed Slow was a debuff type that mattered almost exclusively to PvP, and made combat much less fun for casters in addition to encouraging the use of instant-cast spells. We decided that it was best to remove casting speed debuffs.
      
      
       * Cast Speed Slows 
          * The following abilities no longer slow the target's casting speed by 50%. 
             * Death knight: [Necrotic Strike]
             * Mage (Arcane): [Slow] 
                * Additionally, Slow can now affect more than one target at a time.
               
               
            
            
          * The following abilities have been removed. 
             * Rogue: Mind-Numbing Poison
             * Warlock: [Curse of Enfeeblement]
            
            
         
         
      
      
      As part of a push to combine the different types of Haste in the game as much as possible, we merged Spell Haste and Attack Speed into just Haste, which benefits everyone.
      
      
       * Spell Haste and Attack Speed 
          * The following abilities now provide a 5% increase to melee, ranged, and spell Haste to all Party and Raid members (previously they only increased spell Haste). 
             * Priest (Shadow): [Mind Quickening]
             * Shaman (Elemental): [Elemental Oath]
            
            
          * The following abilities now provide a 5% increase to melee, ranged, and spell Haste to all Party and Raid members (instead of a 10% increase to only melee and ranged attack speed). 
             * Death Knight (Frost, Unholy): [Unholy Aura]
             * Shaman (Enhancement): [Unleashed Rage]
             * Rogue: [Swiftblade's Cunning]
            
            
         
         
      
      
      Some classes received new abilities to provide some of harder-to-find buffs/debuffs, increasing their utility to the Party or Raid.
      
      
       * Other 
          *  [Legacy of the White Tiger] is now also learned by Brewmaster monks, granting a 5% increase to Critical Strike chance for all Party and Raid members.
          *  [Moonkin Form] now grants increased Mastery instead of 5% to Spell Haste.
          *  [Power of the Grave] is a new passive ability learned by Blood death knights. 
             * Power of the Grave grants a bonus to Mastery for all allies within 100 yards.
            
            
         
         
      
      RAID UTILITY BALANCE
      
      Various classes bring various abilities that provide utility to parties and raids. We talked about one type of utility in the Buffs and Debuffs section, above. However, there are other types of raid utility, and it's been in need of more attention. In general, raid utility, especially raid-wide defensive cooldowns, had grown too strong. So many classes and specializations had defensive cooldowns that we had to make raid damage extremely high, as raids would be stacking or chaining together multiple cooldowns. We'd like to return to a system where it's the healers who heal through the scary moments, not the damage dealers, for example.
      
      
      To do so, we've established a new baseline level of raid utility that a specialization should bring, and brought everyone to that new standard by reducing the effects of some abilities, or removing some abilities altogether.
      
      
       * Death knight 
          *  [Anti-Magic Zone] now reduces magic damage taken by 20% (down from 40%).
         
         
       * Druid 
          *  [Tranquility] is now only available to Restoration druids.
         
         
       * Hunter 
          *  [Aspect of the Fox] is a new ability for all hunters. 
             * Aspect of the Fox: Party and raid members within 40 yards take on the aspects of a fox, allowing them to move while casting all spells for 6 seconds. Only one Aspect can be active at a time. 3 minute cooldown.
            
            
         
         
       * Mage 
          *  [Amplify Magic] is a new spell available to mages. 
             * Amplify Magic amplifies the effects of helpful magic, increasing all healing received by 10% for all party and raid members within 100 yards, and lasts 6 seconds with a 2-minute cooldown.
            
            
         
         
       * Monk 
          *  [Avert Harm] has been removed.
          *  [Stance of the Fierce Tiger]'s movement speed increase now affects the monk and all allies within 10 yards.
         
         
       * Paladin 
          *  [Devotion Aura] is now only available to Holy paladins.
         
         
       * Priest 
          *  [Hymn of Hope] has been removed.
         
         
       * Rogue 
          *  [Smoke Bomb] now reduces damage taken by 10% (down from 20%).
         
         
       * Shaman 
          *  [Ancestral Guidance] now causes 20% of damage or healing to be copied as healing to nearby injured allies (down from 40% of damage or 60% of healing).
          *  [Healing Tide Totem] is now available only to Restoration shaman.
          *  [Stormlash Totem] has been removed.
         
         
       * Warlock 
          * Each player can use a [Demonic Gateway] only once every 90 seconds.
          * Healthstones now share a cooldown with Health Potions, separate from other potions.
         
         
       * Warrior 
          *  [Rallying Cry] now increases health by 15% (down from 20%), and is no longer available to Protection warriors.
          *  [Skull Banner] has been removed.
         
         
      
      INSTANT-CAST HEALS
      
      Over time, healers have gained a bigger and bigger arsenal of heals that they can cast while on the move, which removes the inherent cost that movement is intended to have for them, while also limiting players' ability to counter healing in PvP. This left silences and crowd control (which we're trying to curb) as the only ways to actually limit an enemy player's healing output. We're still preserving the option to instantly heal, but are reducing the number of instant-cast healing abilities overall. Raid and dungeon encounter damage during high-movement phases will be adjusted accordingly.
      
      
       * Druid 
          *  [Wild Growth] (Restoration) now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast).
         
         
       * Monk 
          *  [Uplift] (Mistweaver) now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast).
         
         
       * Paladin 
          *  [Eternal Flame] now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast) for Holy Paladins.
          *  [Guarded by the Light] (Protection) now also makes Word of Glory and Eternal Flame instant cast.
          *  [Light of Dawn] now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast).
          *  [Sword of Light] (Retribution) now also makes Word of Glory and Eternal Flame instant cast.
          *  [Word of Glory] now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast).
         
         
       * Priest 
          *  [Cascade] now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast) for Discipline and Holy.
          *  [Halo] now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast) for Discipline and Holy.
          *  [Prayer of Mending] now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast).
         
         
      
      PERIODIC EFFECTS
      
      There are many effects in the game which deal periodic damage over time (DoT) or healing over time (HoT). Historically, these have typically done something called "snapshotting"; they were based on your stats at the time that they were cast, and that was used for calculating their effect for their full lifetime. In Mists, if a warlock casts Corruption on an enemy while Heroism is active, that DoT will continue to tick rapidly based on the temporary haste effect, even after Heroism fades. This has led to some gameplay that has both good and bad sides.
      
      
      Snapshotting encourages refreshing those periodic effects when your stats are high, such as when a temporary buff procs. On the upside, there's a high amount of skill involved in maximizing that. On the downside, it's not intuitive, and the skill ceiling is so high that few can reach it without the use of specialized add-ons. To make matters worse, the benefits of maximizing periodic snapshotting is so high that it creates a balance problem. Players maximizing periodic snapshotting (primarily through the use of add-ons) do drastically more damage than intended. If we balance around taking full advantage of snapshotting, then the players who aren't doing so would fall unacceptably far behind in damage output.
      
      
      Ultimately, we've decided that snapshotting isn't a productive mechanic for the game. The vast majority of periodic effects in the game that snapshotted no longer do so. The only exceptions are ones that do damage based on a percentage of a previous ability's damage (such as the Ignite from a Fire mage's [Fireball], or the periodic damage on a Windwalker monk's [Blackout Kick]), as they inherently act as a delayed damage multiplier to those abilities. Temporary effects which buff the damage or healing of other spells specifically will continue to do so for their lifetime; for example, [Unleash Flame] (which increases the damage of the shaman's next fire spell by 40%), when used on a [Flame Shock], will continue to increase the damage of the periodic effect for its entire lifetime, despite being consumed when the Flame Shock is cast. We still of course want skills and their use to embody interesting choices, and intelligent and skillful use of abilities.
      
      
       * Periodic damage and healing effects now dynamically recalculate their damage, healing, Critical chance, multipliers, and period on every tick.
      
      
      Skilled players will still be able to take advantage of temporary power buffs like trinket procs, and you'll still want to cast your hardest hitting spells within those proc durations. The benefits just won't extend outside the trinket procs' duration. As such, this high-skill gameplay is there, it's just rewarded more consistently. For example, a Priest's trinket procs and an already active Shadow Word: Pain will begin dealing more damage the instant the proc effect occurs, but will return to normal when the proc duration ends. Skilled players will be able to play within these proc durations to maximize effect, but it won't be as detrimental to output to anyone who isn't actively and skillfully using them to their full extent.
      
      
      We also made another change to periodic effects. Haste has long affected the tick rate of periodic effects, and their duration has been rounded to whole numbers of ticks, in order to mostly preserve the original duration of the spell. This lead to Haste breakpoints where having specific amounts of Haste would cause certain periodic effects to gain an extra tick. Part of gearing your character involved trying to reach those Haste breakpoints, but not go over by too much. This was a fairly tedious number to manage, which was again mostly handled by add-ons and guides. With some new tech we're now able to calculate the effect of Haste on tick time dynamically. Any fraction of a full period left at the end of an effect will do a tick of damage or healing in proportion to the remaining time. In other words, there are no more Haste breakpoints; Haste now smoothly and accurately affects periodic effects for the entire duration.
      
      
      This also opened up the opportunity to revise how we handle refreshing periodic effects. For the vast majority of spells and abilities, we had a standard rule that any refresh would add the new cast's duration after the next tick of the existing effect. In simpler terms, you can refresh anywhere between the last and second-to-last tick of a DoT or HoT with no loss. Warlocks had a special passive that changed this logic to allow refreshing with no loss anywhere in the last 50% of a DoT. We liked the flexibility that this provided; though felt it was a bit too powerful. No longer tied to whole tick times, we chose to extend the mechanic that Warlocks had to all classes, but reduce it to 30%. Everyone can now refresh their periodic effects anywhere in the last 30% of the duration for full benefit, and no lost tick time.
      
      
       * Recasting periodic damage over time and healing over time effects that are already on the target now extends those effects to up to 130% of the normal duration of the effect.
      
      TANK VENGEANCE, RESOLVE, AND PVP
      
      The changes to tanking made in Mists of Pandaria turned out quite well, overall. But there were a few rough parts that we're going to smooth over. The biggest one is the offensive capabilities of Vengeance. We like that tanks can provide meaningful DPS to their group, however, it swung wildly based on the fight, even surpassing the dedicated damage dealers occasionally. To solve this, we're going to remove the offensive value of Vengeance, but preserve the defensive value, by making it increase the effect of your active mitigation buttons, instead of Attack Power.
      
      
       * General 
          * Vengeance has been removed and replaced with a new passive ability, Resolve. 
             *  [Resolve]: Increases self-healing and absorption based on damage taken (before avoidance and mitigation) in the last 10 seconds. Without Resolve, Tanks now deal significantly less self-healing and absorption. Resolve has been made much stronger to counteract this, and it increases the amount of self-healing and absorption as appropriate for the fight.
            
            
         
         
      
      
      Then, to keep tank DPS meaningful, we'll be raising their damage, since it would be meager with no Vengeance Attack Power (Vengeance accounted for 70-90% of a tank's damage on high-tank-damage fights in Mists). To do that, we're increasing the damage of several prominent tank abilities. For plate-wearing Tank specializations, [Riposte] has been redesigned to convert Critical Strike into Parry, a defensive stat. That also helps keep secondary stats balanced in offensive value for them.
      
      
       * General 
          * All tanking stances and similar effects now increases threat generated by 900% (up from 600%).
          *  [Riposte] is a passive ability for Blood death knights, Protection paladins, and Protection warriors. 
             * Riposte now gives the character Parry equal to their Critical Strike bonus from gear.
            
            
         
         
       * Death knight 
          *  [Mastery: Blood Shield] now also passively increases Attack Power by 8% (percentage increased by Mastery), in addition to its current effects.
         
         
       * Druid 
          *  [Mastery: Primal Tenacity] now also passively increases Attack Power by 8% (percentage increased by Mastery), in addition to its current effects.
         
         
       * Monk 
          *  [Mastery: Elusive Brawler] now also passively increases Attack Power by 8% (percentage increased by Mastery), in addition to its current effects.
          * Brewmasters no longer deal 15% less damage.
         
         
       * Paladin 
          *  [Mastery: Divine Bulwark] now also passively increases Attack Power by 8% (percentage increased by Mastery), in addition to its current effects.
         
         
       * Warrior 
          *  [Mastery: Critical Block] now also passively increases Attack Power by 8% (percentage increased by Mastery), in addition to its current effects.
         
         
      
      TANKS IN PVP
      
      Finally, we have the topic of tanks in PvP. Apart from a few niche cases like flag carrying; tanks have been intentionally non-viable in serious PvP for several expansions now. The reason for this was simple: fighting against tanks was very frustrating, not fun. They were near-invincible, had numerous CC abilities (primary stuns), but did little enough damage to not be able to kill you (in most cases, anyway). By excluding them from PvP, we preserved the enjoyment of the rest of the playerbase. However, that has the obvious downside that people who prefer to play tanks are excluded from doing so in PvP.
      
      
      We decided that we could do better, and satisfy everyone involved. Our other changes to tanks in Warlords of Draenor got us most of the way there. Tanks' damage will already be tuned to be somewhat weaker than damage dealers, but not trivial. We've already removed the additional CC that they had during the CC Disarmament and Ability Pruning. All that remains that makes them frustrating to fight against is their invincibility. So, we're causing tanks to take increased damage in PvP, so that the net result is that they both deal and take somewhat less damage than damage dealers.
      
      
       * Tanks now take 25% additional damage while engaged in PvP combat.
      
      QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS
      FACING REQUIREMENTS
      
      Strict facing requirements can be frustrating to deal with, especially in hectic Raid combat or PvP environments. In order to ease this frustration, we decided to remove or significantly loosen the facing requirements of all attacks that required the player to be behind their target.
      
      
       * Druid: [Ravage] no longer requires the druid to be behind the target.
       * Druid: [Shred] no longer requires the druid to be behind the target.
       * Rogue: [Ambush] no longer requires the rogue to be behind the target.
       * Rogue (Subtlety): [Backstab] can now be used on either side of the target, in addition to behind the target.
      
      TOOLTIP CLARITY
      
      Being able to quickly understand what an ability does by glancing at the tooltip is of paramount importance to learn how to play with a given class or specialization. We've taken an extensive look at the tooltips for all class abilities, and revised them to be as clear and concise as possible.
      
      
      In some rare cases, we've removed mention of niche information that we don't think is needed. If that's the case, please note that a change to the ability's tooltip does not mean that functionality has changed. If the change in question is not mentioned in the Patch Notes, there has been no change to the ability.
      
      
       * Tooltips for nearly all class abilities have been revised for increased clarity.
      
      SELF-SUSTAINABILITY
      
      Another area of gameplay that we polished is how characters are able to sustain their own health, primarily when frequently killing enemies, such as in solo questing.
      
      
       * Death knight 
          *  [Glyph of Dark Succor] is no longer a Major Glyph and is now a passive ability learned by all death knights at level 60.
         
         
       * Druid 
          *  [Healing Touch] now heals for 50% more when self-cast for Balance druids.
          *  [Predatory Swiftness] now also increases the healing done by [Healing Touch] by 20%.
         
         
       * Hunter 
          *  [Kill Shot] now heals the hunter for 15% of maximum health if it kills the target.
          *  [Survivalist] is a new passive ability learned by Survival Hunters at level 10. 
             * Survivalist increases the Hunter's chance to Multistrike by 10%. Additionally, the Hunter gains 15% health over 10 seconds after killing a target.
            
            
         
         
       * Mage

       * Monk 
          *  [Afterlife] now always summons a Healing Sphere when an enemy is killed.
          *  [Glyph of Afterlife] has been removed and its effects are now baseline for Afterlife.
         
         
       * Paladin

       * Shaman 
          *  [Maelstrom Weapon] now also increases the direct healing of affected spells by 10% per application.
          *  [Glyph of Healing Storm] has been removed and its effects are now baseline for Maelstrom Weapon.
         
         
       * Warlock 
          *  [Drain Life] now heals for 1.5% of maximum health per tick (up from 1.0%).
          *  [Harvest Life] now increases the healing from Drain Life to 3% of maximum health per tick (up from 2.5%).
         
         
      
      REFORGING
      
      The original intent behind Reforging was to offer a way for players to customize their gear, but in practice it offered little in the way of true choice. Players attempting to optimize every piece of gear were well advised to look up how they were supposed to reforge an item in an online guide or tool that had already determined the optimal choice. It added yet another step to the list of things that must be done to a new item before it was ready to be equipped, reducing the joy of getting an upgrade into a chore.
      
      
      If an upgrade drops, we want you to be able to equip it with a minimum of fuss. It is for those reasons that we're removing Reforging from the game.
      
      
       * The Reforging system and associated NPCs have been removed from the game.
       * All existing items that were reforged have been returned to their original un-reforged state.
      
      COMBAT RESURRECTIONS
      
      Combat resurrections are an extremely powerful tool that players have while in combat. Naturally, we apply some limitations. In Mists of Pandaria, that limit was 1 resurrection during a given raid boss encounter for 10-player modes and 3 for 25-player modes. With Flexible difficulty introduced in Patch 5.4, we erred on the forgiving side, and gave Flexible Raids 3 resurrections regardless of raid size.
      
      
      In Warlords of Draenor, the Flex tech has expanded to more difficulty levels, and we needed a new system to handle combat resurrections more fairly. We knew that continuing with a constant 3 would encourage using the smallest possible raid sizes, while scaling with hard breakpoints would discourage specific group sizes just under those points. Additionally, the limit is not shown anywhere in-game, so it can be easy to lose track of how many resurrections the raid has available (or even know that the limit exists).
      
      
      So we've built a new system to be more transparent, and improve usability.
      
      
       * During a boss encounter, all combat resurrection spells now share a single raid-wide pool of charges that's visible on the action bar button.
       * Upon engaging a boss, all combat resurrection spells will have their cooldowns reset and begin with 1 charge. Charges will accumulate at a rate of 1 per (90/RaidSize) minutes. 
          * Example 1: A 10-player raid will accumulate 1 charge every 9 minutes (90/10 = 9).
          * Example 2: A 20-player raid will accumulate 1 charge every 4.5 minutes (90/20 = 4.5).
         
         
       * A charge will only be deducted when a combat resurrection is successful (when the target accepts the resurrection).
       * Raid frames now show a debuff indicating that a dead player has a pending combat resurrection available.
       * Outside of raid boss encounters, combat resurrection spells retain their normal cooldown behavior.
      
      GLYPHS
      
      We made several improvements to the glyph system. While leveling, characters unlock glyph slots at several specific levels. However, in order to get glyphs, characters need to visit an Auction House (and potentially pay way more gold than an average character of that level has yet), or know a scribe from which to request them. To solve this, we've made characters learn some glyphs automatically as they level. Additionally, we now have the ability to make some glyphs exclusive with each other, or require specific specializations.
      
      
       * Many glyphs have been removed, and many new glyphs have been added.
       * Exclusive categories have been added for some glyphs. Other glyphs from the same category cannot be applied at the same time.
       * Some glyphs are now exclusive to a specialization.
       * All classes now learn some of their Major Glyphs as they level. Recipes for these Glyphs have been removed. 
          * At level 25, the following Glyphs are automatically learned by characters of the appropriate class: 
             * Druid: [Glyph of Entangling Roots], [Glyph of Fae Silence], [Glyph of Ferocious Bite], [Glyph of Maul], [Glyph of Omens]( [Glyph of Entangling Energy]), [Glyph of Cat Form]
             * Hunter: [Glyph of Liberation], [Glyph of Pathfinding]
             * Mage: [Glyph of Frost Nova], [Glyph of Blink]
             * Monk: [Glyph of Fortuitous Spheres], [Glyph of Rapid Rolling], [Glyph of Victory Roll]
             * Paladin: [Glyph of Harsh Words], [Glyph of Flash of Light], [Glyph of the Alabaster Shield], [Glyph of Dazing Shield], [Glyph of Avenging Wrath], [Glyph of Templar's Verdict]
             * Priest: [Glyph of Levitate], [Glyph of Holy Fire], [Glyph of Fade]
             * Rogue: [Glyph of Deadly Momentum], [Glyph of Stealth]
             * Shaman: [Glyph of Flame Shock], [Glyph of Thunder], [Glyph of Frost Shock], [Glyph of Healing Wave], [Glyph of Spiritwalker's Grace]
             * Warlock: [Glyph of Siphon Life], [Glyph of Drain Life], [Glyph of Demon Training], [Glyph of Ember Tap]
             * Warrior: [Glyph of Long Charge], [Glyph of Victory Rush], [Glyph of Bloodthirst], [Glyph of Gag Order]
            
            
          * At level 50, the following Glyphs are automatically learned by characters of the appropriate class: 
             * Druid: [Glyph of Rebirth], [Glyph of Rejuvenation], [Glyph of Savagery] ( [Glyph of Savage Roar])
             * Hunter: [Glyph of Mending], [Glyph of Chimaera Shot], [Glyph of Black Ice]
             * Mage: [Glyph of Polymorph]
             * Monk: [Glyph of Spinning Crane Kick] ( [Glyph of Targeted Expulsion])
             * Paladin: [Glyph of Denounce], [Glyph of Divine Storm], [Glyph of Word of Glory]
             * Priest: [Glyph of Reflective Shield], [Glyph of Smite], [Glyph of Mind Blast]
             * Rogue: [Glyph of Recuperate]
             * Shaman: [Glyph of Totemic Recall]
             * Warlock: [Glyph of Fear]
             * Warrior: [Glyph of the Executor]
            
            
          * At level 60, the following Glyphs are automatically learned by characters of the appropriate class: 
             * Death knight: [Glyph of Shifting Presences], [Glyph of Unholy Command], [Glyph of Death Grip]
            
            
          * At level 75, the following Glyphs are automatically learned by characters of the appropriate class: 
             * Death knight: [Glyph of Death and Decay]
             * Druid: [Glyph of Dash], [Glyph of Faerie Fire], [Glyph of Healing Touch], Glyph of Master Shapeshifter
             * Hunter: [Glyph of Misdirection]
             * Mage: [Glyph of Slow], [Glyph of Frostfire Bolt], [Glyph of Water Elemental]
             * Monk: [Glyph of Breath of Fire], [Glyph of Mana Tea], [Glyph of Fists of Fury]
             * Paladin: [Glyph of Light of Dawn], [Glyph of Final Wrath], [Glyph of Double Jeopardy]
             * Priest: [Glyph of Penance], [Glyph of Renew], [Glyph of Dispersion]
             * Rogue: [Glyph of Ambush], [Glyph of Cheap Shot]
             * Shaman: [Glyph of Lightning Shield], [Glyph of Eternal Earth]
             * Warlock: [Glyph of Healthstone]
             * Warrior: [Glyph of Bull Rush], [Glyph of Enraged Speed], [Glyph of Shield Wall]
            
            
         
         
      
      PROFESSIONS
      
      Some of our goals with professions in Warlords of Draenor are to make them more of a personal choice, and less of a mandatory "min/max" selection. To that end, we're removing the direct combat benefits of professions. Additionally, we've made it easier to level Mining and Herbalism. Healing potions have gone mostly unused lately, compared to combat stat potions. We chose to solve that problem, along with a problem with warlock utility, by having healing potions and Healthstones share cooldowns.
      
      
       * Herbalists can now harvest herbs throughout the game world without hard skill requirements. The yield an herbalist will be able to harvest from each node is now determined by skill level.
       * Miners can now harvest mineral nodes in outdoor areas of the game world without hard skill requirements. The yield a miner will be able to harvest from each node is now determined by skill level.
       * Healing potions no longer share a cooldown with other potions, but instead share a 60-second cooldown with Healthstones. The cooldown will not reset until the player leaves combat.
       * Movement Speed enchants now increase Movement Speed by 10% (up from 8%).
      
      TRANSFORMATION EFFECTS
      
      The Transformation system has been improved. Characters can now be affected by multiple transformation effects at once. While multiple transformation or shapeshift effects are active, only the highest priority one will be visible. This allows transformation effects to persist while shapeshifts are active. Additionally, many restrictions on being transformed have been removed.
      
      CLASS CHANGES
      DEATH KNIGHT
      
      A number of changes were made for death knights. Several cooldowns were made spec-specific. Frost and Unholy's rotations remain unchanged for the most part. Blood received revisions to their Active Mitigation design to bring them up to par with changes to other Tanking specializations. Runic Power generation of [Anti-Magic Shell] was standardized, to make it more understandable and balanced.
      
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for a discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For death knights, this focused on removing abilities that were redundant, cooldown reduction, or abilities that were not used often.
      
      
       *  [Blood Parasite] has been removed.
       *  [Blood Strike] has been removed.
       *  [Dark Command] is now only available to Blood death knights.
       *  [Dual Wield] is now only available to Frost death knights.
       *  [Frost Strike] replaces [Death Coil] for Frost death knights.
       *  [Obliterate] replaces Blood Strike for Frost death knights.
       *  [Necrotic Strike] has been removed.
       *  [Raise Dead] is now only available to Unholy death knights.
       *  [Rune of Cinderglacier] has been removed.
       *  [Rune of the Nerubian Carapace] has been removed.
       *  [Unholy Frenzy] has been removed.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      The biggest change here is the merger of Blood Boil into Pestilence. This change effectively turned Roiling Blood into a passive ability; which we replaced with a new talent, Plaguebearer. For Blood specialization, we removed Rune Strike and are adjusting the cost of Death Coil so that it can be used in Rune Strike's place.
      
      
      Another change was to polish up the effect of diseases on the damage of other abilities. Diseases now do enough damage on their own to warrant using them. Having diseases act as multipliers on the damage of other abilities became extraneous and cluttered up the tooltips of those abilities. Those multipliers have been removed, and consolidated their benefits into the corresponding base spell. These changes also results in a slight reduction to ramp-up time.
      
      
       *  [Horn of Winter] no longer generates Runic Power, has no cooldown, and lasts 1 hour.
       *  [Blood Boil] has been removed and its effects have been merged into Pestilence. 
          *  [Pestilence] now deals damage to all enemies within 10 yards, and spreads any diseases on targets hit to the other targets hit.
         
         
       *  [Army of the Dead] now deals 75% less damage.
       *  [Master of Ghouls] has been removed and its effects have been merged into the baseline Raise Dead ability for Unholy death knights.
       *  [Threat of Thassarian] has been removed and its effects have been merged into Might of the Frozen Wastes.
       *  [Rune Strike] has been removed. Blood death knights should now use Death Coil in its place.
       *  [Dancing Rune Weapon] now lasts 8 seconds (down from 12 seconds).
       *  [Death Coil] now costs 30 Runic Power (down from 40 Runic Power), and has a 40 yard range for both hostiles and allies. 
          *  [Sudden Doom] no longer reduces the cost of Death Coil.
         
         
       *  [Icebound Fortitude] now lasts 8 seconds (down from 12 seconds).
       *  [Roiling Blood] has been removed and replaced with Plaguebearer, a new Level-56 talent for death knights. 
          *  [Plaguebearer] causes Death Coil and Frost Strike to extend the duration of Frost Fever and Blood Plague, or add a stack of Necrotic Plague.
         
         
       *  [Pestilence] now deals 50% more damage, but no longer deals additional damage for diseases being present on the target.
       *  [Pillar of Frost] now increases Strength by 15% (down from 20%).
       *  [Obliterate] now deals 25% more damage on both main and off-hand weapons, but no longer deals additional damage for each disease present on the target.
       *  [Rune of the Fallen Crusader] now increases Strength by 20% (up from 15%).
       *  [Scourge Strike] no longer deals additional damage for each disease present on the target. The ability now deals 100% Physical weapon damage, and 50% Shadow weapon damage. These two effects can independently critically hit.
       *  [Vampiric Blood] now increases the amount of healing received by 15% (down from 25%). 
          *  [Glyph of Vampiric Blood] now increases the amount of healing received by an additional 10% (down from 15%).
         
         
      
      FROST CHANGES
      
      In Mists of Pandaria, Frost death knights suffered from rotations that were designed to allow flexibility in ability usage, so that you could pool some resources in order to make decisions about which ones you spent and in which order. Dual Wield vs Two-Handed had different rotational priorities, with different strengths and weaknesses. However, tuning ended up such that you reached a point where you just had to spend all of your resources as fast as possible to avoid wasting any, and all of that depth went out the window. For Warlords, we've adjusted the tuning of several abilities and passives, to ensure that that doesn't happen again, and the rotational decisions and skill are maintained.
      
      
      The goal is that Two-Handed Frost death knights favor their physical damage, slicing through their enemies with heavy Obliterates, whereas Dual-Wielders favor blasting their foes with frost damage, but both overlap considerably to maintain a cohesive specialization.
      
      
       *  [Frost Strike]'s damage has been increased by 100%, but its Runic Power cost has been increased by 5 (up to 25 Runic Power in Frost Presence, and 40 Runic Power in other Presences).
       *  [Icy Talons] now increases attack speed by 20% (down from 45%), and haste by 5% (up from 0%).
       *  [Might of the Frozen Wastes] now increases the damage of Obliterate by 50% (up from 40%) and melee damage by 35% (up from 30%) while wielding a two-handed weapon, and increases the damage of Frost Strike by 50% (up from 35%) while dual-wielding.
       *  [Rune of Razorice] now deals 4% additional weapon damage (up from 2%), and increases Frost damage by 2% per stack (down from 3%).
       *  [Obliterate]'s damage has been increased by 30%.
      
      UNHOLY CHANGES
      
      In order to better balance the scaling rates and value of secondary stats for Unholy death knights, we reduced the power of their passive [Unholy Might] ability, and added a new passive ability to make Multistrike more effective.
      
      
       *  [Necrosis] is a new passive ability for Unholy Death Knights. 
          * Necrosis causes Multistrikes from Festering Strike, Pestilence, Plague Strike, Scourge Strike, and Soul Reaper to also deal a burst of Shadow damage. The amount of burst damage is based on Attack Power, not the damage from the triggering Multistrike.
         
         
       *  [Unholy Might] now increases Strength by 10% (down from 35%).
      
      BLOOD CHANGES
      
      Active Mitigation was a very successful design that was inspired by death knights' tanking style. However, it went beyond that, and death knights themselves were somewhat left behind in that regard. We made several changes to bring up the interactivity of Blood combat. This includes making [Death Strike] cause healing based on attack power, but be affected by the new [Resolve] passive (see tank vengeance and resolve above), which gives it the traditional increase from recent damage. Plus, [Rune Tap] is being significantly improved, to become a strong Active Mitigation button. Additionally, we removed Dodge and Parry from gear, and expect Blood death knights to value Haste and Crit as important secondary stats. In order to achieve that, we made [Riposte] give defensive value to Critical Strikes, and Scent of Blood give defensive value to Multistrike. To solve GCD-capping issues and increase the value of Haste, we also removed the passive rune regeneration increase from Improved Blood Presence. Finally, we tweaked the targeting AI of [Dancing Rune Weapon], and fixed it up to properly copy most talents that you know.
      
      
       *  [Blood Rites] now also causes auto attack multistrikes to generate 15 Runic Power. The Death Strike damage increase it provided has been moved to Veteran of the Third War.
       *  [Blood Presence] now increases Stamina by 20% (down from 25%), and armor by 30% (down from 55%).
       *  [Bone Shield] charges can now be consumed at a rate of once per second (up from once every 2 seconds).
       *  [Crimson Scourge] now increases the damage of Pestilence by 50% (up from 10%) and now also increases the damage of diseases by 30%.
       *  [Dancing Rune Weapon]'s summoned Rune Weapon now remains fixated on the death knight's target at the time of summoning, and copies the effects of talents that are tied to the death knight, such as [Blood Boil], [Frost Fever], or [Asphyxiate]. Should the original target be dead or otherwise unavailable, the Rune Weapon will switch to assist with the death knight's current target.
       *  [Death Strike] now causes healing that scales in effectiveness with attack power, instead of based on damage taken in the last 5 seconds. This healing is affected by [Resolve].
       *  [Heart Strike] has been removed. Blood death knights should use [Pestilence] in its place.
       *  [Improved Blood Presence] now increases all damage dealt by 15%, instead of increasing rune regeneration rate.
       *  [Rune Tap] has been redesigned. It now reduces all damage taken by 40% for 3 seconds. It also now has 2 charges, with a 40-second recharge time. 
          *  [Will of the Necropolis] has been redesigned. It now automatically triggers an immediate, free Rune Tap when you take damage that reduces you below 30% health. This effect cannot occur more often than once every 30 seconds.
          *  [Glyph of Rune Tap] has been redesigned. It now reduces Rune Tap's recharge time by 10 seconds, but reduces the damage reduction it provides by 20%.
         
         
       *  [Scarlet Fever] has been removed. Its effects have been merged into Scent of Blood. 
          *  [Scent of Blood] has been changed. It now causes Pestilence to refresh diseases, and increase the healing of your next [Death Strike] by 20%, stacking up to 5 times.
         
         
       *  [Veteran of the Third War] now increases multistrike chance, and haste by 10% (instead of 9% to Stamina), reduces the chance for attacks to be parried by 3%, increases the damage of Death Strike by 100%, and grants 1 Runic Power per second while in combat.
      
      DEATH PACT
      
      Since the Ghoul pet is now Unholy only, that presents a problem for [Death Pact]. We revised Death Pact to not require an undead minion, but work a little differently. We left it at 50% heal, which is effectively a 33% buff to it from before (see retuning healing spells and player health and resilience above), and added a healing absorption shield for 50% of the amount healed instead. It should now be a more effective heal for staying alive immediately, but with the downside of needing to heal through the healing absorption shield before being healed any further.
      
      
       *  [Death Pact] no longer requires an undead minion, and instead places a healing absorption shield on the death knight for 50% of the amount healed.
      
      MISCELLANEOUS
      
      There were also a few other miscellaneous changes. The Runic Power generation of Anti-Magic Shell was standardized, to make it more understandable and balanced. Level-60 and Level-75 talent rows have swapped places, so the important rune regeneration talents could be acquired earlier. Conversion was changed to cost different amounts by specialization, instead of reducing Runic Power generation differently by specialization. This way, Runic Power beyond what you spend on Conversion is not penalized.
      
      
       *  [Anti-Magic Shell] now restores 2 Runic Power per 1% of max health absorbed.
       *  [Desecrated Ground] now also makes the death knight immune to Roots and Snares.
       *  [Conversion] no longer has an initial tick, and now costs 30 Runic Power/second for Blood, 10 Runic Power/second for Frost, and 20 Runic Power/second for Unholy.
       * Level-60 and Level-75 talent rows have swapped places.
       * Level-60 rune regeneration talents can now be triggered by all Runic Power spenders 
          *  [Blood Tap] now generates one charge for every 15 Runic Power spent.
          *  [Runic Empowerment] now has a 1.5% chance to trigger per Runic Power spent.
          *  [Runic Corruption] now has a 1.5% chance to trigger per Runic Power spent.
         
         
      
      DRUID
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For Druids, we focused thinning out the niche and abilities that were not used often. We made sure to retain abilities for Druids to function in off-spec roles, since that flexibility is a defining characteristic of the class.
      
      
       *  [Barkskin] is now available to Balance, Guardian, and Restoration druids.
       *  [Enrage] has been removed.
       *  [Faerie Fire] is now available only to Feral and Guardian druids.
       *  [Innervate] has been removed.
       *  [Lacerate] is now available only to Guardian druids.
       *  [Leader of the Pack] no longer restores Mana and is only available to Feral druids. 
          * Mana regeneration has been increased by 100% for Feral and Guardian druids.
         
         
       *  [Mangle] (Cat Form) has been removed.
       *  [Maul] is now available only to Guardian Druids.
       *  [Might of Ursoc] has been removed.
       *  [Nature's Swiftness] is now available only to Restoration druids.
       *  [Nourish] has been removed.
       *  [Owlkin Frenzy] has been removed.
       *  [Rip] is now available only to Feral druids.
       *  [Survival Instincts] is now available only to Feral and Guardian Druids.
       *  [Swipe] is now requires the druid to be in Cat Form and is available only to Feral druids.
       *  [Symbiosis] has been removed.
       * Thrash is now available to all druid specializations (was Feral and Guardian only).
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      For consolidation of abilities, we merged several passive abilities. One notable change is the merging of the Ravage into Shred, and Pounce into Rake; saving a couple keybinds that were only used in conjunction with Prowl.
      
      
       * Cat Form now increases movement speed by 30% (up from 25%).
       *  [Infected Wounds] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into Mangle and Shred for Feral and Guardian druids.
       *  [Lifebloom] can no longer stack, and its healing has been increased to compensate.
       *  [Omen of Clarity] (Feral) now affects druid spells and abilities that cost Energy.
       *  [Rake] now also stuns the target for 4 seconds if used while stealthed, and is only available to Feral druids. 
          *  [Pounce] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into Rake.
         
         
       *  [Regrowth] now has a duration of 12 seconds (up from 6 seconds), but no longer refreshes its duration on targets at or below 50% health.
       *  [Revive]'s mana cost has been reduced by 87%.
       *  [Rip] now has a duration of 24 seconds (up from 16 seconds), but its duration is no longer extended by Shred.
       *  [Shred] no longer requires the Druid to be behind the target (See also: facing requirements.) and is now available to all specializations. Shred now deals 35% more damage in addition to having double the normal chance to critically strike while stealthed. 
          *  [Ravage] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into Shred.
         
         
       *  [Skull Bash] no longer increases the mana cost of the victim's spells.
       *  [Starfall] no longer cancels when mounting. However, it can no longer hit stealthed or invisible targets.
       *  [Survival Instincts] no longer requires or forces the druid into Cat or Bear Form, and now lasts 6 seconds (down from 12 seconds) with a 2-minute cooldown (down from 3 minutes), and can have up to 2 charges (up from 1 charge).
       *  [Thick Hide] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into Bear Form. 
          * Bear Form now increases armor by 250% for all druid specializations (down from 330% for Guardian druids, but up from 120% for non-Guardian druids), no longer increases Haste and Critical Strike from items by 50%, but instead causes Haste to reduce the global cooldown, increases Stamina by 20% (down from 40%), and reduces magic damage taken by 10% (down from 25%).
          * For Guardian druids, Bear Form now also reduces magical damage taken by 25%, reduces chance to be critically hit by 6%, and reduces chance for attacks to be parried by 3%.
         
         
       *  [Tiger's Fury] now lasts 8 seconds (up from 6 seconds) and is usable during Berserk.
       *  [Track Humanoids] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into Cat Form.
       *  [Travel Form] now automatically transitions between Aquatic, Land, and Flight forms depending on the Druid's location. 
          *  [Glyph of the Stag] now teaches the Druid a separate shapeshift ability, Stag Form. Stag Form allows the Druid to act as a mount for party members and will not switch between different Travel Forms.
         
         
       * Wild Mushrooms no longer become invisible.
      
      GUARDIAN CHANGES
      
      Guardian druids had increased Armor as their Mastery for a while now. However, one of the new secondary stats available to all tanks is Bonus Armor. We didn't feel that the difference of being additive vs. being a multiplier was significant enough to warrant keeping their Mastery around. Additionally, active mitigation hasn't played out as well for Guardians as it has for some other tanks. We decided to redesign the Mastery for Guardian druids to something that compliments the Avoidance-heavy nature of [Savage Defense], and also to improve the usability of [Tooth and Claw] for more consistent damage reduction. Note that [Mastery: Primal Tenacity]'s calculation uses the damage before any other absorbs you have, and before Tooth and Claw's effects, so that it isn't negatively affected by any of the changes.
      
      
      The maximum number of charges that can be accumulated for [Savage Defense] has been reduced to make its uptime more consistent between short and long periods of tanking. Rage for Guardian druids has been problematic throughout Mists of Pandaria. Most of their rage generation was extremely passive, and most of their button presses either didn't affect their survivability, or only trivially did so. We made changes to Haste and Critical Strike, to try to solve these rage generation problems, and improve their rotation. We also added Ursa Major, in order to give a defensive value to the new Multistrike stat.
      
      
       * Guardian druids' Mastery ( [Nature's Guardian]) has been replaced with a new Mastery: Primal Tenacity. 
          *  [Mastery: Primal Tenacity] causes the druid to gain a Physical absorb shield equal to 12% of the attack's damage when they are hit by a Physical attack. Attacks which this effect fully or partially absorbs cannot trigger Primal Tenacity.
         
         
       *  [Ursa Major] is a new passive ability for Guardian druids. 
          * Ursa Major causes Multistrikes from auto attacks, Lacerate periodic damage, and Mangle to grant the druid the Ursa Major effect. Ursa Major increases maximum health by 2% for 25 seconds. When the effect is refreshed, the remaining portion is added to the new effect.
         
         
       * Auto-attacks now generate 5 Rage (down from 10.9 Rage).
       *  [Bear Form] no longer increases Haste and Critical Strike from items by 50%, but instead causes Haste to reduce the global cooldown.
       *  [Faerie Fire] no longer has a chance to reset Mangle's cooldown.
       *  [Maul] now costs 20 Rage (down from 30 Rage).
       *  [Mangle] now generates 10 Rage (down from 15 Rage).
       *  [Lacerate] now generates 2 Rage, has no cooldown (down from a 3-second cooldown), and the periodic bleed effect triggers every 1 second (down from 3 seconds).
       *  [Primal Fury] now generates 8 Rage (down from 15 Rage) from non-periodic critical strikes (up from only Auto Attacks and Mangle).
       *  [Savage Defense] can now accumulate 2 charges (down from 3 charges), and regenerates a charge every 12 seconds (up from 9 seconds).
       *  [Soul of the Forest] (Guardian) now increases Mangle's Rage generation by 5 (down from 10).
       *  [Thrash] now generates 1 Rage every time it deals direct or periodic damage, has no cooldown (down from a 6-second cooldown), but no longer has a chance to reset Mangle's cooldown.
       *  [Tooth and Claw] can now accumulate 2 charges, its effects stack on the target, and are affected by Resolve.
      
      FERAL CHANGES
      
      Feral druids received one major change, and few tweaks beyond what's been mentioned above in ability pruning and facing requirements. Combo Points are now stored "on the player", meaning that when you switch targets, any accumulated Combo Points remain with you. [Primal Fury] was changed to let it affect area attacks as well. Critical strike chance of [Ferocious Bite] was changed in order to increase the value of Critical Strike. [Glyph of Savage Roar] was reworked to better achieve its intended effect.
      
      
       * Combo Points for Feral druids are now shared across all targets, and are no longer lost when switching targets.
       *  [Ferocious Bite] now has double the normal chance to critically strike against bleeding targets (instead of having an additional 25% chance to critically strike).
       *  [Primal Fury] now also grants a combo point for area attacks that critically strike the druid's primary target.
       *  [Glyph of Savagery] has been renamed [Glyph of Savage Roar], and now grants a free 5 combo point [Savage Roar] when leaving [Prowl], instead of allowing Savage Roar to be used with 0 combo points.
      
      BALANCE REBALANCED
      
      We have some extensive changes for Balance druids. One of our guiding principles with game design is that things should be "easy to learn, hard to master". We're not particularly happy with the Moonkin rotation because it was actually hard to learn, and easy to master (especially with regards to periodic damage effects no longer snapshotting). Energy and [Eclipse] mechanics were not intuitive for many newer players. Once you became accustomed to the rotation, there wasn't much additional depth to mastering it; maintain two DoTs, hit these other two buttons whenever they light up, and spam one of two buttons in between. In order to try to make it easier to learn, but also add some gameplay depth and challenge we're making a significant revision to the rotation. The list of changes is quite dense, so here's a summary of the changes.
      
      
      Summary of changes to Balance:
      
      
       * Balance Energy is a bar that automatically cycles back and forth between Lunar and Solar sides, like night and day. The closer to one end that the bar is, the more damage that side's spells do.
       * Balance druids now have four rotational spells. 
          *  [Starfire]: Lunar direct damage spell 
             * Cast when the Lunar side is stronger
            
            
          *  [Wrath]: Solar direct damage spell 
             * Cast when the Solar side is stronger
            
            
          *  [Moonfire]: Lunar periodic damage spell. While closer to Solar, this button is replaced with [Sunfire], a Solar periodic damage spell. 
             * Maintain both effects where possible
            
            
          *  [Starsurge]: Direct damage spell that benefits from whichever side is stronger. Has up to 3 charges, and buffs the damage of the next few Wraths or Starfires. 
             * Cast when able to follow up with a few strong Wraths or Starfires.
            
            
         
         
      
      
      That's the basics of the new Moonkin rotation. There's room for improvement beyond that, learning to optimally maintain both periodic damage effects while maximizing their damage, timing Starsurges to optimize the benefit of its buff, make use of [Starfall] and [Hurricane] for area damage, and taking advantage of the strengths of each side (such as Moonfire and Sunfire having significant differences now). Here are the full details of the changes.
      
      
      Details of changes to Balance:
      
      
       * Balance Energy system has been redesigned. Balance Energy is a bar that cycles back and forth between Lunar and Solar sides, like night and day, with a 40 second cycle time (from Lunar to Solar and back to Lunar). 
          * Balance Energy is no longer generated through spells, talents, or other effects anymore.
         
         
       *  [Eclipse] has been redesigned. 
          * Eclipse inspires the druid with the power of the moon and the sun, causing the damage of Lunar and Solar spells to be increased by up to 30% based on how close Balance Energy levels are to the appropriate side. 
             * Example: With 0 Balance Energy, the damage bonus is evenly split between Lunar and Solar, and the Druid receives a 15% increase to damage for both spell types. With 80 Solar Energy, the Druid receives a 27% damage increase to Solar spells and a 3% damage increase to Lunar spells.
            
            
          *  [Mastery: Total Eclipse] now increases the maximum damage bonus of Eclipse by 12% (increasing with Mastery).
          * The damage of damage-over-time effects changes dynamically as Eclipse changes.
         
         
       *  [Astral Communion] now increases the rate that Balance Energy cycles by 300% while channeled.
       *  [Astral Storm] has been removed.
       *  [Celestial Alignment] has been redesigned. 
          * Celestial Alignment causes the Druid to enter Celestial Alignment, a state where Balance Energy cycle is paused, all damage done is increased by 20%, and all Lunar and Solar spells benefit from the maximum Eclipse bonus. While in Celestial Alignment, Moonfire and Sunfire will also apply the other spell's periodic damage effect. Lasts 15 seconds with a 3 minute cooldown.
         
         
       *  [Hurricane] now has a range of 35 yards (up from 30 yards), but is only available to Balance and Restoration druids.
       *  [Incarnation]: Chosen of Elune now increases spell damage by 15% while active (was a 25% increase to Arcane and Nature damage, but only while Eclipse is active).
       *  [Lunar Shower] has been redesigned and renamed into Astral Showers. 
          *  [Astral Showers] calls upon greater Lunar and Solar energy to permanently empower the Druid's Moonfire and Sunfire spells. 
             * Moonfire's periodic damage effect duration is increased by 100%.
             * Sunfire's periodic damage effect is now applied to all enemies within 5 yards of the target.
            
            
         
         
       *  [Moonfire] now has a base duration of 20 seconds (up from 14 seconds), but is no longer extended by Starfire and [Starsurge] critical strikes. Upon reaching 100 Lunar Energy, the next Moonfire deals 100% additional initial damage.
       *  [Shooting Stars] now adds 1 full charge of Starsurge and Starfall when it triggers, and now has a 5% chance to trigger when the most recent Moonfire or Sunfire deals periodic damage. This chance is doubled on critical strikes.
       *  [Soul of the Forest] (Balance) has been redesigned. 
          * Soul of the Forest (Balance) now increases the damage bonus from Lunar and Solar Empowerment by an additional 15%.
         
         
       *  [Starfall] now shares charges with Starsurge, and has no cooldown of its own. It also now hits all nearby enemies (up from 2 nearby enemies).
       *  [Starfire] now has a 3 second cast time (up from 2.7 seconds).
       *  [Starsurge] now has 3 charges and a 30 second recharge time (instead of a 15 second cooldown). Starsurge now also grants Lunar or Solar Empowerment. 
          * Lunar Empowerment causes the next 2 casts of Starfire to deal 30% more damage.
          * Solar Empowerment causes the next 3 casts of Wrath to deal 30% more damage.
         
         
       *  [Sunfire] is no longer its own spell and replaces Moonfire on the action bar whenever Balance Energy is on the Solar side. Sunfire now has a base duration of 24 seconds (up from 14 seconds), but is no longer extended by Wrath and Starsurge critical strikes. Enemies may still suffer from both Moonfire and Sunfire’s periodic damage components simultaneously. Upon reaching 100 Solar Energy, the next Sunfire deals 100% additional initial damage.
       *  [Wild Mushroom] (Balance) now begins snaring enemies immediately when summoned, lasts 20 seconds, and can no longer be detonated to deal damage. 
          *  [Wild Mushroom: Detonate] has been removed.
         
         
      
      TRANQUILITY SIMPLIFICATION
      
       [Tranquility] has an amazingly strong effect (pour a ton of healing into the whole raid/party), but had excessive complexity for a relatively simple task (5 different targets per tick, a short HoT, stacking, varied strength by raid size). So, we simplified it significantly. It still will be used just as it always has been.
      
      
       *  [Tranquility] now heals every Party and Raid member within range every 2 seconds for 8 seconds. It no longer places a periodic effect on each target. The total amount of healing it generates in Raids should be approximately the same as before this change.
      
      RESTORATION CHANGES
      
      Restoration druids got a few changes as well. In Patch 5.4, a Glyph was introduced where you could choose to attach your [Efflorescence] to [Wild Mushroom], instead of to [Swiftmend]. That was a rousing success and the glyph was taken by nearly all Restoration druids. It felt like a much better situation to us, so we decided to remove the glyph, and bake that gameplay in permanently. [Genesis] and [Wild Mushroom: Bloom] fill a similar need for burst healing, so Wild Mushroom: Bloom has been removed; leaving Wild Mushroom to focus on the Efflorescence effect.
      
      
      Secondly, while we are fine with the playstyle where a Restoration druid blankets their Raid in Rejuvenations, the [Swift Rejuvenation] passive made that too strong, and limited their scaling with Haste. We removed that passive to encourage using other spells more, but still allow Rejuvenation blanketing as a viable playstyle. Omen of Clarity got changed to not trigger more often with Tree of Life as it was too strong in our new healing model. Soul of the Forest was also redesigned to fit better with Restoration and Genesis based on the new design for periodic effects.
      
      
       * Genesis has been redesigned. 
          * Genesis now consumes all of the Druid's Rejuvenation effects on party or raid members within 60 yards and applies the Genesis effect to them instead. Genesis heals the target for an amount equal to the remaining healing from the consumed Rejuvenation effects over 3 seconds.
         
         
       *  [Living Seed] now heals for 50% of the critical heal (up from 30%).
       *  [Force of Nature] Treant's healing now benefits from Mastery.
       * Incarnation: Tree of Life no longer enhances Lifebloom. Instead, it also enhances Rejuvenation, increasing its healing by 50%, and reducing its cost by 30%.
       * Heart of the Wild (Restoration) now increases healing done by 35% (up from 25%).
       * Omen of Clarity (Restoration) can now only be triggered by the most recently applied Lifebloom, and now causes the next Regrowth to be free.
       * Soul of the Forest for Restoration Druids has been redesigned. 
          * Soul of the Forest (Restoration) when casting Swiftmend, the Druid gains Soul of the Forest. Soul of the Forest reduces the cast time of the next Healing Touch by 50%, or increases the healing of the next Regrowth or Rejuvenation by 100%, or increases the healing of the next Wild Growth by 50%.
         
         
       *  [Swift Rejuvenation] has been removed.
       *  [Wild Mushroom] (Restoration) now has a 30-second cooldown, lasts for 30 seconds, provides periodic healing to nearby allies, and no longer collects Rejuvenation overhealing. 
          *  [Wild Mushroom: Bloom] has been removed.
          *  [Swiftmend] no longer causes Efflorescence.
         
         
      
      TALENTS
      
      The level 90-Talent row for druids was designed to encourage hybrid gameplay. We decided that, while you shouldn't have to give up a significant amount of your primary role throughput in order to gain the off-role benefit, you also don't need to gain an actual benefit to your primary role throughput benefit either. We've reduced the power of their primary role benefit, making them roughly neutral in their effect on your primary role. Note that the increase to off-role healing from [Nature's Vigil] is not actually a buff (see retuning healing spells and player health and resilience above).
      
      
       *  [Dream of Cenarius] 
          * Balance: The talent has been redesigned for Balance Druids and now causes Moonfire and Sunfire casts with Lunar or Solar Peak to also heal a random injured ally.
          * Feral: Increases the healing of Healing Touch and Rejuvenation by 20%, and causes them to also heal the Druid when cast on allies.
         
         
       *  [Heart of the Wild] no longer provides an increase to Hit, Expertise, Stamina, Agility, and Intellect while active.
       *  [Nature's Vigil], while active, increases single-target damage and healing caused by healing spells by 30% (up from 25%), and all single-target damage spells also heal a nearby friendly target for 40% of the damage done (up from 25%). Its healing now targets allies within 40 yards of the druid (instead of within 40 yards of the target).
      
      HUNTER
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning or consolidating class abilities.
      
      
      Hunters have lacked a strong distinction between the different specializations. What we mean by that is that the hunter specializations all had rotations that felt similar, with Marksmanship and Survival having the most blurred identities (Beast Mastery felt well rooted in the pet). Hunters were also some of the most afflicted by button bloat. To address these problems, we opted to make changes to each specialization's rotation, primarily through removing abilities, and making some of them unique to each spec. This means things like [Aimed Shot] being the primary Focus dump for Marksmanship, instead of [Arcane Shot] or [Serpent Sting] being available only to Survival. Hunters also had a large number of cooldown abilities, which we've also cut down (some of which we moved to the talent tree, competing with other active buttons).
      
      
       *  [Arcane Shot] is no longer available to Marksmanship hunters. The talent Thrill of the Hunt received a change to preserve its value to Marksmanship Hunters. 
          *  [Thrill of the Hunt] now also reduces the cost of Aimed Shot when active, to preserve its value to Marksmanship hunters.
         
         
       *  [Aspect of the Hawk] has been removed. 
          * Aspect of the Iron Hawk has been renamed to [Iron Hawk], and now passively provides a 10% reduction to all damage taken.
         
         
       *  [Cower] has been removed as a pet ability.
       *  [Hunter's Mark] has been removed.
       *  [Kill Shot] is no longer available to Survival hunters.
       *  [Master Marksman] has been removed.
       *  [Piercing Shots] has been removed.
       *  [Rapid Recuperation] has been removed.
       *  [Stampede] is now a level-75 talent, replacing Lynx Rush. 
          *  [Lynx Rush] has been removed and replaced by Stampede.
         
         
       *  [Steady Focus] has been removed.
       *  [Rabid] has been removed as a pet ability.
       *  [Rapid Fire] is now available only to Marksmanship hunters.
       *  [Improved Serpent Sting] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into a redesigned Serpent Sting.
       *  [Viper Venom] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into a redesigned Serpent Sting.
       *  [Serpent Sting] has been redesigned based on Serpent Spread and is now available only to Survival hunters. 
          * Serpent Spread has been renamed into Serpent Sting.
          * Serpent Sting now causes Multi-Shot and Arcane Shot to also apply a Serpent Sting poison dealing instant and periodic damage.
          *  [Cobra Shot] no longer extends the duration of Serpent Sting.
         
         
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
       *  [Cobra Strikes] now has a 20% chance to trigger (up from a 15% chance), but now only grants 1 charge each time it triggers (down from 2 charges).
       *  [Frenzy] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into Focus Fire. 
          *  [Focus Fire] now naturally grants the Hunter's pet the ability to gain Frenzy.
         
         
       *  [Go for the Throat] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into Invigoration. 
          *  [Invigoration] now also grants 15 Focus to the Hunter's pet from auto-shot Critical Strikes.
         
         
       *  [The Beast Within] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into Bestial Wrath. 
          *  [Bestial Wrath] now naturally includes the effects of The Beast Within.
         
         
       *  [Lock and Load]'s effects have been incorporated into Black Arrow.
       *  [Black Arrow]'s cooldown is reset if it is dispelled.
       *  [Mend Pet] and [Revive Pet] now share the same button and changes based on the condition of the Hunter's pet.
       *  [Thrill of the Hunt] now has a 6% chance to trigger for every 10 Focus spent (instead of a flat 30% chance).
      
      ROTATION DEPTH AND TALENTS
      
      We've changed the combat rotations of each hunter specialization (primarily through ability pruning) with the goal of them being a platform to build upon with talents. To facilitate this, we've modified several talents to add additional rotational depth. Hunters had many talent options which added abilities to their rotation, but most of them had quite simple usage, with little interaction with your rotation or other abilities. Now, there should be more of a variety; still some simple talents, but also some talents that create a more engaging combat rotation.
      
      
       *  [Barrage] now has a 20 second cooldown (down from 30 seconds), costs 60 Focus (up from 30 Focus), and its damage has been increased by 100%.
       *  [A Murder of Crows] has been changed. Its duration, cost, and cooldown have been reduced by 50%. It no longer has a shorter cooldown when used on low health targets. Instead, its cooldown is reset if the target dies.
       *  [Fervor] has been replaced with a new passive ability, Steady Focus. 
          *  [Steady Focus] increases Focus Regeneration by 50% for 10 seconds after using Cobra Shot or Steady Shot twice in a row, or after using Focusing Shot.
         
         
       *  [Dire Beast] now restores 2 Focus per hit (down from 5 Focus per hit).
      
      ASPECTS
      
      One of the most difficult abilities to decide to cut was [Aspect of the Hawk]. It began to feel fairly meaningless, since it was used virtually all of the time in combat, so might as well have just been passive. We decided to cut Aspect of the Hawk, and bake in its benefit to the other abilities. The remaining aspect abilities are all utility only, and are being moved off the stance bar and made toggles.
      
      
      Overall, hunters should see a drastic reduction in the number of active buttons, and have a clearer distinction between the different specializations. With some of these changes, you may find yourself favoring a different specialization. Keep in mind that Draenor Perks, earned from levels 91 to 99, will serve to further distinguish the different specializations.
      
      
       *  [Aspect of the Cheetah] and [Aspect of the Pack] both now share a 10-second cooldown and no longer appears on the stance bar.
       *  [Glyph of Aspect of the Beast]: The ability taught by this Glyph no longer appears on the stance bar and is now on the global cooldown.
       *  [Glyph of Aspect of the Cheetah]: No longer triggers any cooldown on Aspects.
      
      MARKSMANSHIP CHANGES
      
      One of our new secondary stats, Multistrike, is strikingly similar to the Wild Quiver Mastery for Marksmanship hunters. To address this similarity, we replaced Wild Quiver with a new Mastery: Sniper Training. Marksmanship hunters that favored Mastery before will want to favor Multistrike for a similar feel. For their new Mastery, we wanted to add some depth to their moment-to-moment gameplay, and compliment Critical Strike. In order to do that, we brought back the concept of Sniper Training.
      
      
      We also changed the design of Chimera Shot (and fixed its name), in order to better capture the intended flavor. Finally, we added an interaction between Careful Aim and Rapid Fire (and indirectly Aimed Shot through a Draenor Perk), so as to add a bit more depth to their gameplay.
      
      
       *  [Bombardment] now reduces the cost of Multi-Shot by 25 Focus (up from a 20 Focus reduction to cost).
       * Mastery: [Wild Quiver] has been removed.
       * Sniper Training is a new Mastery for Marksmanship Hunters, replacing Wild Quiver. 
          * Sniper Training activates when the Hunter stands still for 3 seconds, giving them the Sniper Training effect for 6 seconds, increasing damage, shot range, and critical strike damage by 4% (increased by Mastery).
         
         
       * Chimera Shot has been renamed [Chimaera Shot]. It is now a two-headed shot that hits two targets, costs 35 Focus (down from 45 Focus), and deals Frost or Nature damage, but no longer heals the hunter.
       *  [Careful Aim] now also provides its effect against all targets when Rapid Fire is active, and increases critical strike chance by 60% (down from 75%).
      
      SURVIVAL CHANGES
      
      Apart from rotational changes through Ability Pruning, changes for Survival hunters mostly center on Lock and Load. We changed how Lock and Load is triggered to increase the value of Multistrike, provide gameplay depth and the ability to pool damage more. Also note the new passive ability, Survivalist, which increases multistrike chance by 10%, in order to give Survival Hunters some baseline Multistrike chance.
      
      
       *  [Explosive Shot] now costs 15 Focus (down from 25 Focus).
       *  [Survivalist] is a new passive ability learned by Survival hunters at level 10. 
          * Survivalist increases Multistrike damage by 20%, and causes the hunter to gain 15% health over 10 seconds after killing a target.
         
         
      
      HUNTER PET ABILITIES
      
      We did a comprehensive pass on hunter pet abilities. As mentioned above in crowd control and diminishing returns, all full crowd-control abilities have been removed from Hunter pets and replaced those with new abilities, including spreading some that were previously restricted to exotic pets. Additionally, hunters can now tame beasts from new pet families.
      
      
       * Several raid buffs provided by hunter pets have been changed into auras that are automatically applied to the Hunter's party or raid.
       * Abilities unique to each hunter pet family have been revised to provide a standard buff, debuff, or ability. 
          * Combat Resurrection ability: Crane, Moth, Quilen
          * Mortal Wounds debuff: Carrion Bird, Devilsaur, Riverbeast, Scorpid
          * Increased Spell Power buff: Serpent, Silithid, Water Strider
          * Increased Strength/Agility/Intellect buff: Dog, Gorilla, Shale Spider, Worm
          * Increased Critical Strike Chance buff: Devilsaur, Quilen, Raptor, Shale Spider, Water Strider, Wolf
          * Temporary Haste buff: Core Hound, Nether Ray
          * Increased Haste buff: Rylak, Hyena, Sporebat, Wasp
          * Increased Mastery buff: Cat, Hydra, Spirit Beast, Tallstrider
          * Increased Stamina buff: Bear, Goat, Rylak, Silithid
          * Increased Multistrike buff: Basilisk, Chimaera, Core Hound, Dragonhawk, Fox, Rhino, Wind Serpent
          * Increased Versatility buff: Bird of Prey, Boar, Porcupine, Ravager, Rhino, Worm
          * An ability that increases dodge chance of the pet by 30% for 10 seconds: Bat, Monkey
          * An ability that reduces damage taken by the pet by 50% for 12 seconds: Beetle, Crab, Quilen, Rhino, Shale Spider, Turtle
          * An ability that Reduces the movement speed of the target by 50%: Chimaera, Crocolisk, Silithid, Spider, Warp Stalker
          * The following pet families provide an ability that puts the pet in stealth mode, slowing its movement speed by 50%. The first attack from stealth receives a 20% bonus to damage: Cat, Spirit Beast
          * The following pet families provide an additional ability. 
             * Chimaera - [Froststorm Breath]: Causes Froststorm damage to all targets in front of the Chimaera over 8 seconds.
             * Core Hound - [Molten Hide]: Causes Fire damage to attackers.
             * Devilsaur - [Feast]: The devilsaur feasts on a nearby Humanoid or Beast corpse within 5 yards, healing it for 20% of its maximum health and restoring 20 focus over 5 seconds.
             * Direhorn - [Reflective Armor Plating]: Deflects all spells cast in front of the Direhorn for 6 seconds.
             * Rylak - [Updraft]: Slows the fall speed of both itself and the hunter for 30 seconds.
             * Spirit Beast - [Spirit Mend]: Heals the target ally instantly, and additional healing over 10 seconds.
             * Water Strider - [Surface Trot]: Allows the Hunter and the Water Strider to walk across water.
             * Worm - [Burrow Attack]: Deals Nature damage to nearby enemies over 8 seconds.
            
            
         
         
      
      MISCELLANEOUS
      
      There were also a few other changes, primarily for quality of life and rotational consistency.
      
      
       *  [Aimed Shot] no longer interrupts Auto Attacks, and can be cast while moving.
       *  [Dismiss Pet] now ignores line of sight.
       *  [Explosive Trap] now places a periodic-damage effect on each target within the radius of the explosion, rather than a persistent effect on the ground.
       *  [Growl] now has a 30-yard range.
       * Hunter pets now have a 1-second global cooldown.
      
      MAGE
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For mages, we removed several of the unused and niche abilities from each specialization that didn't use them primarily.
      
      
       *  [Arcane Barrage] replaces Fire Blast for Arcane mages.
       *  [Arcane Blast] now replaces Frostfire Bolt for Arcane mages.
       *  [Arcane Explosion] is now available only to Arcane mages.
       *  [Blizzard] is now available only to Frost mages.
       *  [Conjure Mana Gem] has been removed.
       *  [Evocation] is now available only to Arcane mages.
       *  [Flamestrike] is now available only to Fire mages.
       *  [Ice Lance] replaces Fire Blast and is now only available to Frost mages.
       *  [Pyromaniac] has been removed.
       *  [Shatter] is now available only to Frost mages.
       *  [Mage Armor] is now a passive effect and is available only to Arcane mages.
       *  [Frost Armor] is now a passive effect and is available only to Frost mages.
       *  [Molten Armor] is now a passive effect and is available only to Fire mages.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Most of the mage abilities required little consolidation. The most notable change here is turning Armor spells into passive abilities for each specialization.
      
      
       *  [Mage Armor] is now a passive effect and is available only to Arcane mages.
       *  [Frost Armor] is now a passive effect and is available only to Frost mages.
       *  [Molten Armor] is now a passive effect and is available only to Fire mages.
       *  [Combustion] no longer deals direct damage or stuns.
       *  [Frostbolt] can no longer be used to heal the mage's Water Elemental.
       *  [Ice Floes] no longer has a restriction on base cast or channel times for spells (formerly only worked on spells with a base cast or channel time of less than 4 seconds).
       * Ignite now deals the same total damage with a 1 second period (down from 2 seconds). Base duration changed to 5 seconds so that duration when refreshed remains 6 seconds.
       *  [Mirror Image] is now a level-90 Talent, replacing [Invocation].
       *  [Polymorph] variants except for Polymorph: Sheep are now all learned as spells and grouped in a flyout on the Spellbook instead of being a Minor Glyph that alters the visuals of Polymorph: Sheep.
      
      TALENT REVISIONS
      
      The mage class has good specialization distinction when it comes to their single-target rotations, but utility and area-of-effect spells were heavily shared between specializations. Commonly, these spells were redundant as well. We made many of their spells specialization-specific (as described in ability pruning above). And probably most significant, we made changes to several existing talents.
      
      
       [Presence of Mind] was extremely strong for instant crowd control (CC), which we wanted to curtail. Rather than completely remove Presence of Mind, we made it a base Arcane spell and a new talent in its place, [Evanesce]. At first, it may seem out of place for Evanesce to be on a movement-focused talent row. In practice, it offers Mages the option to remain stationary instead of moving away from avoidable damage.
      
      
       *  [Presence of Mind] is no longer a talent, and is now learned by only Arcane mages.
       *  [Evanesce] is a new talent available at level 15, replacing Presence of Mind. 
          * Evanesce causes the mage to fade into the nether, avoiding all attacks for 3 seconds. This spell has a 45-second cooldown, replaces Ice Block, is not on global cooldown, and may be cast while a cast-time spell is in progress.
         
         
      
      
      Going along with our goals to reduce cooldown stacking across all of the classes, we decided to remove [Alter Time]'s DPS contribution. Alter Time has a number of clever movement and utility uses, but in practice it was mostly being used for additional uptime of offensive cooldowns. mages also had many redundant forms of survival utility, so we moved a utility-only version of Alter Time into the talent tree, replacing [Temporal Shield].
      
      
       *  [Temporal Shield] has been removed and replaced by Alter Time.
       *  [Alter Time] is now a level-30 Talent, replacing Temporal Shield. 
          * Alter Time now lasts for 10 seconds (up from 6 seconds), has a 90-second cooldown (down from 3 minutes), and no longer affects the mage's mana, buffs, or debuffs.
         
         
      
      
      A few of the abilities reset by Cold Snap were made spec-specific, or could be overridden with talents, so we expanded what it can affect to compensate.
      
      
       *  [Cold Snap] now also resets the cooldown of [Presence of Mind], [Dragon's Breath], and [Evanesce].
      
      
      Ice Ward was changed to make it more competitive with the rest of its talent row.
      
      
       *  [Ice Ward] now causes the next 3 attackers (up from 1) to trigger a Frost Nova.
      
      
      The [Mage Bomb] level-75 Talent row, the bomb row, was also problematic. We chose to add the bombs to all mages' rotations in order to spice them up a bit, to provide rotational variety. That succeeded, and we're overall happy with how they interact with your rotation in a single-target situation, but they also came with the prospect of multi-dotting (applying your damage-over-time spell to many enemies, individually), which we don't feel is an appropriate fit for mages. Additionally, in order to make all 3 bombs useful to all specializations, we had to lose some of their spec-specific perks. And, even more importantly, many mages did not like DoT gameplay at all.
      
      
      In order to solve all of these problems, we decided to merge the 3 current bomb talents into one that changes based on spec. That allows us to reintroduce spec-specific perks to each bomb, and makes room for some non-DoT alternatives.
      
      
       *  [Nether Tempest], [Living Bomb], and [Frost Bomb] now all share the left-talent slot and is available based on the mage's specialization. 
          * Frost Bomb has been redesigned. 
             * Frost Bomb now lasts 12 seconds, has no cooldown, and explodes every time the target is hit by the mage's [Ice Lance] while frozen. The damage per explosion has been reduced by 75% to compensate.
            
            
          * Living Bomb can once again be applied to multiple targets, can be spread by [Inferno Blast], and has a 1.5-second cooldown. More of its damage has been moved into its explosion.
          * Nether Tempest can now only be on 1 target at a time (down from unlimited), but its secondary damage now hits all targets in range (up from only 1), deals 100% of the primary damage (up from 50%), and its damage can now be increased by Arcane Charges.
         
         
       *  [Unstable Magic] is a new talent that's available at level 75, and occupies the middle-talent slot. 
          * Unstable Magic causes [Arcane Blast], [Fireball], and [Frostbolt] have a chance to explode on impact, dealing an additional 50% damage to the target, and all other enemies within 8 yards.
         
         
       * The right-talent slot for level 75 has a new Talent that varies by specialization. 
          *  [Blast Wave]: Cause an explosion of fiery force around the target enemy or ally, dealing Fire damage to all enemies within 8 yards, and dazing them, reducing their movement speed by 70% for 4 seconds. If the primary target is an enemy, they take 100% increased damage. Replaces [Frost Nova]. Instant cast ability with a 25-second cooldown and 2 charges.
          *  [Ice Nova]: Cause a whirl of icy wind around the target enemy or ally, dealing Frost damage to all enemies within 8 yards, and freezing them for 4 seconds. If the primary target is an enemy, they take 100% increased damage. Replaces [Frost Nova]. Instant cast ability with a 20-second cooldown and 2 charges.
          *  [Supernova]: Cause a pulse of Arcane energy around the target enemy or ally, dealing Arcane damage to all enemies within 8 yards, and knocking them into the air. If the primary target is an enemy, they take 100% increased damage. Replaces [Frost Nova]. Instant cast ability with a 25-second cooldown and 2 charges.
         
         
      
      
      One of the most problematic Talent rows in the game has been the mage level-90 row. The primary theme of the row was mana, which only Arcane mages actually cared about. Bonus damage was added in, making it functional for all mages, but muddled in its goals. Additionally, some of them just weren't fun to play with. We've revised the row to be purely about damage, and made them have less maintenance cost. Arcane mages will have enough mana regeneration without these talents to perform well.
      
      
       *  [Incanter's Ward] has been removed and replaced by Incanter's Flow, a new level-90 Talent. 
          *  [Incanter's Flow]: Magical energy flows through you, increasing all spell damage done by 5% per stack. While in combat, the magical energy builds up to 5 stacks over 5 seconds and then diminishes down to 1 stack over 5 seconds. This cycle repeats every 10 seconds.
         
         
       *  [Invocation] has been removed and replaced by Mirror Image.
       *  [Mirror Image] is now a level-90 Talent, replacing Invocation. Mirror Images now inherit 100% of the mage's Spell Power (up from 5%), last 40 seconds (up from 30 seconds), and have a 2-minute cooldown (down from 3 minutes). 
          *  [Glyph of Mirror Image] has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into Mirror Image.
         
         
       *  [Rune of Power] no longer replaces Evocation, no longer increases mana regeneration, and now lasts 3 minutes (up from 1 minute).
      
      FROST CHANGES
      
      Frost mages enjoyed newfound PvE viability in Mists of Pandaria, and we intend to continue that into the future. However, we do want to clean up some rough spots, especially around their valuing of secondary stats, and the amount of instant-cast spells in their rotation. The [Frost Armor] and [Shatter] changes increase the amount of Haste/Critical chance that they can acquire on gear before they start hitting soft caps. The Shatter change also lowers the value of Critical Strike for a bit. The changes to the level-75 Talent row meant that having a Bomb spell is no longer guaranteed, so we changed the way that [Brain Freeze] is triggered. Ice Lance's non-frozen damage was doubled to make up for no longer having access to Fire Blast and reducing redundancy in the process.
      
      
       *  [Frost Armor] now grants an 8% chance to Multistrike instead of 7% Haste.
       *  [Shatter] now multiplies Critical Strike chance by 1.5 (down from 2).
       * The [Brain Freeze] effect now increases [Frostfire Bolt]'s damage by 25%, and can now stack up to 2 times. It also no longer triggers from the bomb talents, and instead has a 10% chance to trigger from [Frostbolt] casts. Each Multistrike of Frostbolt increases that cast's chance by an additional 25%. (Total of 60% on double-Multistrikes).
       *  [Ice Lance]'s base damage has been increased by 100%, but its damage multiplier against frozen targets has been reduced by 50%.
       *  [Fingers of Frost] now increases Ice Lance damage by 100% (up from 25%).
       *  [Glyph of Frostfire Bolt] is now available only to Fire mages.
       *  [Glyph of Icy Veins] now causes [Icy Veins] to provide 35% chance to Multistrike instead of 20% Haste.
      
      FIRE CHANGES
      
      Fire mage's rotation is looking solid with the new Draenor Perks. However, their cooldown strength could use a buff.
      
      
       *  [Combustion]'s damage has been increased by 100% and replaces Deep Freeze for Fire mages.
      
      ARCANE CHANGES
      
      In order to make room for more Haste effects to apply to [Arcane Blast], we raised its cast time and damage slightly. We also made Arcane Charges last longer, to aid in questing and encounters.
      
      
       *  [Arcane Blast]'s cast time has been increased to 2.25 seconds (up from 2 seconds), damage has been increased by 12.5% to compensate.
       * Arcane Charges now last 15 seconds (up from 10 seconds), and increases mana cost by 100% (down from 150%).
       *  [Arcane Missiles] can now accumulate 3 charges (up from 2 charges).
      
      MONK
      
      The brand-new class for Mists of Pandaria, monks, turned out to be a ton of fun. Brewmasters stayed fairly solid all expansion long. Windwalkers needed a few tweaks here and there, especially to their Mastery, and still have a few shortcomings that we hope to improve, but overall worked quite well. Mistweavers had a bit of a rollercoaster ride, veering between weak and strong over the course of the expansion. Most of our changes to monks will focus on Mistweavers, to try to get them just right.
      
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For monks, the pruning focused on niche abilities. One removal of note is that of Healing Sphere. The active ability to place a Healing Sphere was particularly awkward to use, but overpowered if used perfectly. So we removed it, and replaced it with Healing Surge for Windwalkers and Brewmasters.
      
      
       *  [Avert Harm] has been removed.
       *  [Clash] has been removed.
       *  [Dematerialize] has been removed.
       * Power Guard has been removed.
       *  [Sparring] has been removed.
       *  [Spinning Fire Blossom] has been removed.
       *  [Stance of the Sturdy Ox] now replaces Stance of the Fierce Tiger for Brewmaster Monks.
       *  [Stance of the Spirited Crane] now replaces Stance of the Fierce Tiger for Mistweaver Monks.
       *  [Swift Reflexes] has been removed.
       *  [Zen Meditation] is no longer available to Mistweaver Monks.
       *  [Healing Sphere] has been removed. Abilities that can summon Healing Spheres, [Mastery: Gift of the Serpent] (Mistweavers), Gift of the Ox (Brewmasters), and Afterlife (Windwalkers) can still summon Healing Spheres. 
          *  [Surging Mist] is now available to all monk specializations. It costs 30 Energy in Ox or Tiger Stance, and continues to cost mana in Serpent Stance and Crane Stance. However, it only generates Chi for Mistweaver Monks.
         
         
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Monk ability consolidation is fairly straightforward. It includes merging of some passive abilities, and removing unneeded abilities that didn't create the gameplay depth they had been intended to.
      
      
       *  [Teachings of the Monastery] has been removed. Its effects modifying Spinning Crane Kick has been incorporated into Stance of the Wise Serpent.
       *  [Brewmaster Training] has been removed. Its effects have been incorporated into Stance of the Sturdy Ox.
       *  [Desperate Measures] has been removed. Its effects have been incorporated into Stance of the Sturdy Ox.
       *  [Combo Breaker] has been removed. Its effects have been incorporated into Stance of the Fierce Tiger.
       *  [Combat Conditioning] has been removed. Its effects have been incorporated into Stance of the Fierce Tiger.
       *  [Fortifying Brew] now lasts 15 seconds (down from 20 seconds).
       *  [Power Strikes] now triggers every 15 seconds (up from every 20 seconds), and also triggers from Surging Mist (for Mistweavers only), but no longer triggers from Crackling Jade Lightning.
       *  [Resuscitate]'s mana cost has been reduced by 80%.
       *  [Spinning Crane Kick] now always generates 1 Chi, and no longer reduces movement speed.
       *  [Paralysis] now always lasts 60 seconds against creatures, regardless of facing.
       *  [Disable] is now available only to Windwalker monks.
       *  [Uplift] now follows standard area-of-effect capping rules, diminishing in effectiveness beyond 6 targets.
       *  [Zen Meditation] is no longer available to Mistweaver monks, and no longer redirects harmful spells cast against party and raid members.
       *  [Zen Sphere] no longer has a target limit.
      
      MISTWEAVER CHANGES
      
      About midway through the expansion, it became clear that mana was not valuable for Mistweavers. We tried some adjustments to solve that, but it proved too large of a change to make at the time. We chose to just live with that problem for the time being, and tune them around not really caring much about Spirit or mana (once they reached epic gear).
      
      
      Now that we have the time to tweak things for Mistweavers to acquire new gear, we're making changes to get them in the right spot. Initially, we experimented with giving Mistwavers a 1-second global cooldown (GCD) akin to that of the rogue to give them a faster combat feel. However, it's proven difficult to balance. Haste is attractive to healers because it lowers not just cast time but GCD as well. Therefore, monks valued Haste much less than other healers. We explored a few options, but ultimately landed on changing the core GCD for Mistweavers from 1 second to the standard 1.5 seconds, which you will be able to reduce with Haste. This will feel jarring at first, but we're confident that it's for the best, long-term.
      
      
       * All abilities available to Mistweavers now have a 1.5-second global cooldown (up from 1 second). 
          *  [Stance of the Fierce Tiger] now reduces the global cooldown of the Mistweaver monk's abilities by 0.5 seconds.
          *  [Stance of the Sturdy Ox] now reduces the global cooldown of the Mistweaver monk's abilities by 0.5 seconds.
         
         
       *  [Focus and Harmony] is a new passive ability for Mistweaver monks, causing Haste to reduce the global cooldown, and causes Attack Power to be equal to 100% of Spell Power. 
          * Stance of the Wise Serpent no longer provides this Spell Power to Attack Power conversion.
         
         
       *  [Crackling Jade Lightning]'s throughput has been increased by 100%, but it no longer generates Chi for Mistweaver monks. Additionally, it is free in Stance of the Wise Serpent.
       *  [Chi Brew] now grants 1 charge of Mana Tea (down from 2 charges).
       *  [Ascension] now increases maximum Mana by 20% (up from 15%).
       *  [Detonate Chi] is a new spell available to Mistweaver monks, instantly detonating all Healing Spheres, and causing each of them to heal a nearby ally within 12 yards of the sphere with a 15-second cooldown.
       * Healing Spheres now heal an ally within 12 yards (up from 6 yards) for 100% (up from 50%) of their normal healing, when they expire.
       * Gift of the Serpent chance to trigger has increased significantly for various Mistweaver spells, conferring a larger percentage of the maximum value.
       *  [Renewing Mist] now jumps to the most injured target in range.
       *  [Soothing Mist]'s healing has been increased by 100%, its GCD has been reduced to 0.5 seconds, but no longer heals immediately, and no longer generates Chi.
       *  [Stance of the Wise Serpent] no longer increases Haste from items by 50%.
       *  [Summon Jade Serpent Statue] now has a 10-second cooldown (down from 30 seconds).
       *  [Thunder Focus Tea] no longer costs Chi, causes the next [Renewing Mist] to jump up to 4 times (instead of causing the next [Uplift] to refresh the duration of Renewing Mists on all targets). Its effect on Surging Mist remains unchanged.
       *  [Jade Mists] is a new passive ability for Mistweaver monks, causing them to gain 5% more of the Multistrike stat from all sources, and also causes Renewing Mist and Rising Sun Kick to have a chance equal to Multistrike chance to not go on cooldown when used. This effect cannot trigger on the next Renewing Mist or Rising Sun Kick.
      
      
      Another issue with Mistweavers is that of [Eminence], which has never really played out how we had hoped. The intent with Eminence was to create an alternate play style to fulfill the fantasy of healing through dealing damage, since we knew a lot of players had that fantasy, and a new class was the perfect opportunity to satisfy that.
      
      
      Having two play styles in one spec (Eminence, and traditional Mistweaving, healing primarily through casting heals) proved challenging to balance, because we don't want players to take the best parts of both and stack them into an unintended superior spec. The most notorious of these cases was " [Jab]-Jab- [Uplift]". In order to solve this problem, we're giving Mistweavers two stances. Stance of the Wise Serpent will continue to be the stance from which to do traditional Mistweaving. The new [Stance of the Spirited Crane] will be the stance to use for Eminence. You can swap stances at will, with only the cost of a GCD and any current Chi that you've accrued. The intention is that Crane Stance allows Mistweavers to trade healing for damage; it should fall somewhere in the middle between being a full healer, and being a full damage dealer.
      
      
       *  [Stance of the Spirited Crane] is a new ability for Mistweaver monks, which replaces [Stance of the Fierce Tiger], and provides the following effects. 
          * The monk gains [Eminence], causing all damage dealt to also heal nearby allies. 
             * Eminence now causes a nearby target to be healed for 50% of all damage caused by the monk and includes auto attacks.
             * Stance of the Wise Serpent no longer provides this benefit.
            
            
          *  [Crackling Jade Lightning] channels 150% faster, generates 1 Chi each time it deals damage, but costs 300% more mana.
          * Blackout Kicks grants Crane's Zeal, increasing Critical Strike chance by 20% for 20 seconds.
          *  [Blackout Kick] causes Eminence to heal 5 allies instead of 1, but heals for only 20% of damage dealt instead of 35%.
          * The monk gains a stack of Vital Mists for every Chi consumed. Vital Mists reduces the cast time and Mana cost of the next Surging Mist by 20% per stack up to a maximum of 5 stacks.
          *  [Muscle Memory] has been removed.
          * Serpent's Zeal has been removed.
          * Vital Mists has been removed.
         
         
       *  [Rising Sun Kick] is now available to Mistweaver and Windwalker monks. However, it does not cause Mortal Wounds for Mistweavers. 
          *  [Stance of the Fierce Tiger] now causes Rising Sun Kick to cause Mortal Wounds, instead of it causing Mortal Wounds naturally.
         
         
       * The following abilities now require [Stance of the Wise Serpent] for Mistweavers: 
          *  [Enveloping Mist], [Renewing Mist], [Soothing Mist], [Uplift]
         
         
       * The following abilities now require [Stance of the Spirited Crane] for Mistweavers: 
          *  [Blackout Kick], [Jab], Rising Sun Kick, [Tiger Palm]
         
         
      
      HEALING SPHERES
      
      Healing Spheres have been improved. You'll no longer waste them when running over multiples at once when you only need a little healing. We significantly improved the Mistweavers' Healing Spheres effect when they expire. We also made [Afterlife]'s Healing Spheres consistent with the rest of the class.
      
      
       * When a player runs through multiple Healing Spheres at once, only as many as needed to heal the player to full health will be consumed (instead of all of them if the player is injured at all).
       * Healing Spheres summoned by Mastery: Gift of the Serpent (Mistweaver) now heal an injured ally within 12 yards (up from 6 yards) for 100% (up from 50%) of their normal effect when they expire, and scales with Spell Power instead of Attack Power.
       * Healing Spheres summoned by Afterlife (Windwalkers) now heals for the same amount as other Healing Spheres (instead of healing for 15% of maximum health).
       * Healing Spheres generated from Gift of the Ox now heals the Monk if they are within 6 yards of the sphere when it expires.
      
      SHARED ABILITY CHANGES
      
      There were several changes that affected multiple monk specializations. We'd like to see monks using [Transcendence] more often, so its usability has been improved (some baseline, and some in a Draenor Perk). For [Touch of Death], we like that it's a unique execute being usable only once, but found it impractical to use on bosses and have improved its usability. For [Tiger Strikes], we buffed it to grant Multistrike ability which it was similar to already, and extended it to work with all monk specializations. To better balance the damage of Brewmaster versus Windwalker where both share many of the same abilities, we removed the damage increase provided by Tiger Stance, and increased the damage of melee abilities to compensate.
      
      
       *  [Chi Brew] now has a 60 second recharge time (up from 45 seconds).
       *  [Stance of the Fierce Tiger] now also includes the benefits of Combo Breaker and Combat Conditioning, and is replaced by another stance for Brewmaster and Mistweaver Monks. 
          * Brewmaster: Stance of the Sturdy Ox replaces Stance of the Fierce Tiger.
          * Mistweaver: Stance of the Spirited Crane replaces Stance of the Fierce Tiger.
         
         
       *  [Tiger Strikes] is now available to all monk specializations, and has a chance to trigger on successful auto attacks and their Multistrikes. It has a 10% chance to trigger while using a two-handed weapon, and a 5% chance to trigger while dual wielding. 
          * When triggered, Tiger Strikes now grants a 25% increase to Multistrike for 8 seconds instead of a 50% increase to attack speed and double attacks for 4 attacks.
         
         
       *  [Touch of Death] is no longer available to Mistweaver monks, and is usable on targets that have 10% or less health remaining, or have less current health than your maximum health. The rules against players remain unchanged.
       *  [Transcendence: Transfer] no longer has an energy or mana cost.
      
      WINDWALKER CHANGES
      
      For Energy-based gameplay to function well, the primary limitation on ability usage should be Energy, not time. That breaks down when a rotation becomes limited by available GCDs, rather than by Energy. Windwalkers were hitting this "GCD-cap" too easily, causing scaling problems as they geared up, and removing rotational choices. To solve this problem, we’ve made a few tweaks that will slow down their rotation slightly; but still allow Windwalkers who enjoy the GCD-capped playstyle to have options available to focus on Haste and Energy regeneration. Individually, these may sound like significant nerfs, but Windwalker damage has been adjusted to compensate for these changes. The goal is to address the issue with GCD-capping while not reducing DPS.
      
      
       *  [Combo Breaker] now has an 8% chance to trigger, per effect, per Jab (down from 12%).
       *  [Jab] now costs 45 Energy while in Stance of the Fierce Tiger.
      
      
      There are a couple of additional changes for Windwalkers. [Storm, Earth, and Fire], got buffed to make it smoother to use. We also buffed [Fists of Fury] because we felt that the ability wasn't giving a strong enough damage boost given its restrictions and impact on the Monk's rotation.
      
      
       *  [Fists of Fury] now deals 100% increased damage, and always deals full damage to the primary target; additional targets are still affected by the damage split.
       *  [Storm, Earth, and Fire] no longer has an energy cost, and is off global cooldown.
      
      BREWMASTER CHANGES
      
      For Brewmasters, [Gift of the Ox] has been modified to allow it to scale defensively with the new Multistrike stat. The Black Ox Statue has been modified to aid Monks in establishing threat on new enemies instead of shielding allies. We also removed the Misfire effect, as it did not live up to its original idea, and was unnecessary.
      
      
       *  [Summon Black Ox Statue] no longer casts Guard on allies and now has a 10-second cooldown (down from 30 seconds). Black Ox Statue now passively attracts the attention of all enemies within 30 yards, causing a minor amount of threat each second.
       *  [Dizzying Haze] now has no Energy cost, but no longer causes the target's melee attacks to sometimes misfire.
       *  [Elusive Brew] now increases dodge chance by 45% (up from 30%).
       *  [Gift of the Ox] now has a chance to trigger only from auto attack Multistrikes, instead of from all auto attacks. It has a 100% chance to trigger while using a two-handed weapon, and a 62.5% chance to trigger while dual wielding.
       *  [Stance of the Sturdy Ox] now increases Stamina by 25% (up from 20%), reduces magic damage taken by 10% (down from all damage taken by 25%), and grants a 50% increase to Armor, but no longer increases Energy regeneration.
       * Shuffle now increases Stagger and Parry by 10% (down from 20%).
      
      PALADIN
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For paladins, the pruning focused on removing niche abilities, and trimming cooldowns.
      
      
       *  [Avenging Wrath] is no longer available to Protection paladins.
       *  [Divine Favor] has been removed.
       *  [Divine Plea] has been removed. Mana costs for paladins have been adjusted accordingly.
       *  [Guardian of Ancient Kings] is now only available to Protection paladins.
       *  [Hand of Salvation] is now only available to Protection paladins.
       *  [Holy Light] has been removed.
       *  [Inquisition] has been removed.
       *  [Seal of Righteousness] is no longer available to Holy paladins.
       *  [Seal of Truth] is no longer available to Holy paladins.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      There were a few mergers of passive abilities, and some tweaks to a couple of abilities.
      
      
       * Divine Light has been renamed Holy Light.
       *  [Divine Protection] now lasts 8 seconds (down from 10 seconds).
       *  [Guardian of Ancient Kings] now lasts 8 seconds (down from 12 seconds).
       *  [Daybreak] now heals all allies within 10 yards for 15% of Holy Shock's healing (instead of 75%, split between each ally).
       *  [Grand Crusader] now triggers from any avoidance, not just dodge and parry.
       *  [Hand of Sacrifice] is now off global-cooldown.
       *  [Judgment] is now naturally free for Holy paladins, and naturally generates 1 Holy Power for Protection and Retribution paladins. 
          *  [Judgments of the Bold] has been removed.
         
         
       *  [Redemption]'s mana cost has been reduced by 95%.
       *  [Selfless Healer] no longer causes Bastion of Glory to apply to Flash of Light. For Holy paladins, it now increases the healing of Flash of Light on others by 35% per stack (up from 20%). For Retribution and Protection paladins, the effect on Flash of Light remains unchanged.
       *  [Sword of Light] now increases damage by 25% (down from 30%).
       *  [The Art of War]'s effects have been merged into baseline Exorcism.
      
      HOLY CHANGES
      
      We made several changes for Holy, to go along with other larger system changes to compensate for the removal of [Guardian of Ancient Kings] from Holy, and merged its benefits into [Divine Favor]. In order to follow through on our change to merge all types of Haste %, we removed the Spell Haste % from [Seal of Insight] to a Holy-only passive, so that it didn't also increase Protection's baseline Haste by 10%. Our changes to healer mana and mobility also indirectly increased the value of [Selfless Healer] by a large amount, so we brought it back down to be even in power with the other talents on its row. We also raised the range of [Denounce] to be consistent with other spells. Lastly, we adjusted the critical strike chance of [Holy Shock], to increase the value of Critical Strike for Holy paladins.
      
      
       *  [Avenging Wrath] now also increases all of the paladin's healing by 20% for its duration.
       *  [Beacon of Light] now has a small Mana cost.
       *  [Denounce]'s range has increased to 40 yards (up from 30 yards).
       *  [Holy Shock] now has twice the normal chance to critically strike (instead of having an additional 25% chance to critically strike).
       *  [Infusion of Light] now also passively increases Haste by 10%.
       *  [Seal of Insight] no longer increases spell Haste by 10%.
       *  [Selfless Healer] for Holy no longer causes [Judgment] to grant Holy Power. It also is only usable on [Flash of Light], no longer on [Holy Light] or [Holy Radiance].
       *  [Tower of Radiance]'s effects have been changed and merged into baseline Beacon of Light. 
          * Tower of Radiance now causes Flash of Light and Holy Light on a Beacon of Light target to refund 40% of the spell's Mana cost instead of generating 1 Holy Power.
         
         
      
      PROTECTION CHANGES
      
      For Protection, we tweaked [Eternal Flame] in order to reduce its massive self-healing amount, and provide better balance between talents on that row. We also added a new passive, [Shining Protector], in order to give defensive value to the new Multistrike stat. Holy Wrath's damage and cooldown were also increased, and Sanctified Wrath changed to buff it further, in order to give Protection Paladins more burst threat and damage, while retaining its core damage-splitting identity.
      
      
       *  [Mastery: Divine Bulwark] now increases damage reduction from Shield of the Righteous by 6% (scaling with Mastery, down from starting at 8%), and causes Bastion of Glory to increase healing received from Word of Glory by 6% (scaling with Mastery, down from starting at 8%).
       * Bastion of Glory no longer affects the periodic healing of [Eternal Flame]. It still affects the direct healing portion of the ability.
       *  [Sanctuary] now reduces damage taken by 10% (down from 15), and no longer increases Armor.
       *  [Guarded by the Light] now increases Stamina by 15% (down from 25%), and increases block chance by 5% (down from 10%).
       *  [Shield of the Righteous] now reduces physical damage taken by 20% (down from 25%).
       * Bastion of Glory now increases Word of Glory's healing by 6% per stack (down from 10% per stack).
       *  [Shining Protector] is a new passive ability for Protection Paladins. 
          * Shining Protector: All heals you receive have a chance equal to your Multistrike chance to trigger Shining Protector, healing you for an additional 30% of the triggering heal.
         
         
       *  [Holy Wrath]'s damage has been increased by 100%, and its cooldown increased to 15 seconds (up from 9 seconds).
       *  [Sanctified Wrath] for Protection Paladins has been redesigned. 
          * Sanctified Wrath (Protection) now increases the damage of Holy Wrath by 100% and causes it to generate 1 Holy Power.
         
         
      
      MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES
      
      We made a few additional changes to paladins. We revised the functionality of [Hammer of the Righteous] a bit, such that its performance is about the same, but its tooltip is much clearer. We also made [Execution Sentence] much more attractive to use as an emergency button. We also revised how [Eternal Flame] interacts with Holy Power, and allowed it to once again trigger Illuminated Healing. One big change for Retribution that isn't mentioned here is the removal of [Inquisition] (see ability pruning), which will have a notable effect on their rotation.
      
      
       *  [Eternal Flame]'s periodic healing effect has been changed. Its duration now scales with Holy Power, instead of its healing. Its effect at 3 Holy Power remains unchanged.
       *  [Hammer of the Righteous] now deals 50% Physical weapon damage (up from 15%) to the primary target, but the primary target is no longer hit with the Holy damage.
       * Illuminated Healing can once again be triggered by Eternal Flame.
       * Seals no longer cost any mana.
       * Stay of Execution (the Holy version of [Execution Sentence]) now deals its healing in a large burst at first, and then decreasing over time (reversed from before).
      
      PRIEST
      
      Priests received several significant changes, mainly focused on reining in Discipline's damage absorption shields, improving quality of life for Discipline and Holy specializations, and solving single-target damage issues for Shadow.
      
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For priests, pruning focused on removing redundant off-role abilities, trimming cooldowns, and removing niche abilities.
      
      
       *  [Binding Heal] is now only available to Holy priests.
       *  [Evangelism] is now available only to Discipline priests.
       *  [Hymn of Hope] has been removed.
       *  [Heal] has been removed.
       *  [Inner Fire] has been removed.
       *  [Inner Focus] has been removed.
       *  [Inner Will] has been removed.
       *  [Rapture] has been removed.
       *  [Renew] is now available only to Holy priests.
       *  [Shadow Word: Death] is now available only to Shadow priests. 
          * Discipline and Holy priests can add a self-damaging utility to [Holy Fire] through a new Major Glyph.
         
         
       *  [Spirit Shell] is now a level-75 talent, replacing [Divine Insight] for Discipline priests.
       *  [Strength of Soul] has been removed.
       *  [Train of Thought] has been removed.
       *  [Void Shift] has been removed.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Priests had quite a few bits of complication strewn throughout their spells which we polished out.
      
      
       *  [Greater Heal] has been renamed to Heal.
       *  [Borrowed Time]'s effects have been merged into baseline Power Word: Shield for Discipline priests. 
          * Borrowed Time has been redesigned. It now increases the priest's stat gains to Haste from all sources by 40% for 6 seconds.
         
         
       *  [Devouring Plague] now always costs 3 Shadow Orbs, and now heals the priest for 100% of all damage it deals, instead of healing per tick.
       *  [Holy Fire] now lasts 9 seconds (up from 7 seconds).
       *  [Shadowform] no longer allows any healing spells to be cast but also no longer has a restriction on casting other Holy spells.
       *  [Vampiric Embrace] now heals all party and raid members for 10% of damage done, and this healing is no longer split between targets (up from 75% of damage done, split between targets).
       *  [Lightwell]'s healing effect is no longer canceled if the target takes enough damage.
       *  [Pain Suppression] no longer reduces the target's threat by 5%.
       *  [Power Word: Solace] now restores 2% mana (up from 1%).
       *  [Dispersion] and [Vampiric Touch] no longer restore mana. 
          * Base mana regeneration rate for Shadow priests has been increased by 200%, Shadow Word: Pain and Vampiric Touch mana costs have been reduced by 50% to compensate.
         
         
       *  [Evangelism] no longer affects the damage or mana cost of spells. Damage of affected spells have been adjusted to compensate.
       *  [Shadow Word: Pain]'s initial damage is now considered direct damage, not periodic damage. 
          * Shadowy Apparitions and Shadowy Insight are no longer able to trigger from this initial direct damage.
         
         
       *  [Divine Hymn] now heals all party or raid members instead of a variable number depending on raid size. Its healing has been adjusted to compensate.
       *  [Focused Will] now triggers from any damage taken instead of being limited to being the victim of any damage above 5% of total health or being critically hit by non-periodic attacks.
      
      LEVEL-90 TALENTS AND ATONEMENT
      
       [Atonement] was the original damage-to-healing conversion ability, but grew out of control during Mists of Pandaria. We decided to reduce its effectiveness, to bring it more in line with our goal of it being an option to trade significant healing for significant damage (ending up somewhere between a full healer and a full damage dealer). Another place where Discipline's absorbs were too strong was in their interaction with the level-90 talents, especially in large raids. Near the end of Mists of Pandaria, we uncapped the AoE healing of that talent row; that has proven to be a mistake in Discipline's case, not just because it caused the level-90 talents themselves to heal for too much, but rather because the gigantic overhealing that that produced translated into gigantic [Divine Aegis] absorbs.
      
      
       *  [Atonement] now heals for 25% less than before.
       *  [Cascade]'s Mana cost has been reduced by 67%. 
          * Discipline and Holy: Cascade now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast, see also: instant cast heals), heals for 50% less, and no longer damages enemies.
          * Shadow: Cascade no longer heals allies.
         
         
       *  [Divine Star]'s Mana cost has been reduced by 67%, and now follows standard AoE capping rules. 
          * Discipline and Holy: Divine Star now heals for 50% less, and no longer damages enemies.
          * Shadow: Divine Star no longer heals allies.
         
         
       *  [Halo]'s Mana cost has been reduced by 67%, and now follows standard AoE capping rules. 
          * Discipline and Holy: Halo now has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast, see also: instant cast heals), heals for 50% less, and no longer damages enemies.
          * Shadow: Halo no longer heals allies.
         
         
      
      HOLY CHANGES
      
      For Holy priests, our biggest concern is with the Chakras. We think that Chakras are the defining abilities of Holy priests, but that they haven't lived up to their potential. We decided to move more of their effectiveness from their raw throughput buff (which felt like a penalty for being in the wrong chakra, rather than a bonus for being in the right Chakra) into their bonus effects, and the Holy Word spells that they grant. Please note that all Priest healing spells have been retuned to account for the loss of throughput increases from Chakras. We also returned [Renew] to a normal 1.5-second global cooldown (GCD), so that Renew blanketing is still possible, but less ideal without Haste. Finally, the ability for Power Word: Shield to critically strike or Multistrike is now baseline for all Priest specializations instead of just Discipline so that it continues to be a viable choice for Holy at higher gear levels.
      
      
       *  [Divine Providence] is a new passive ability for Holy priests. 
          * Divine Providence increases the amount of the Multistrike stat gains from all sources by 5%, and increases the damage and healing of Multistrikes by 20%.
         
         
       *  [Cascade] no longer refreshes the duration of Renew for Chakra: Serenity.
       *  [Circle of Healing]'s cooldown is now 12 seconds (up from 10 seconds).
       *  [Chakra: Chastise] no longer grants a chance for Smite to reset [Holy Word: Chastise]'s cooldown.
       *  [Chakra: Sanctuary] no longer increases healing of area-of-effect spells. It now causes healing spell casts to reduce the remaining cooldown on Circle of Healing by 1 second instead of always reducing the cooldown by 2 seconds.
       *  [Chakra: Serenity] no longer increases healing of single-target spells.
       *  [Power Word: Shield] may now critically strike or Multistrike. 
          *  [Divine Aegis] no longer grants [Power Word: Shield] a chance to critically strike.
         
         
       *  [Divine Fury] has been removed. (See also: hit and expertise removal.)
       *  [Holy Word: Sanctuary] now heals for 60% more than before.
       *  [Holy Word: Serenity] now heals for 40% more than before.
       *  [Power Word: Shield] now has a chance for a critical effect based on critical strike chance and can Multistrike based on Multistrike chance for all specializations.
       *  [Purify], [Halo], [Cascade], and [Divine Star] can now be cast while in [Spirit of Redemption] form.
       *  [Rapid Renewal] no longer reduces the global cooldown of [Renew].
      
      SHADOW CHANGES
      
      Shadow priests had one large problem toward the end of Mists of Pandaria: single-target damage. Their AoE and multi-DoT damage was some of the best around, so they still ended up competitive on most fights. But, in any fight that was mostly single-target, they felt lacking. Additionally, one of the new stats we're adding in Warlords of Draenor, Multistrike, is almost exactly what their current Mastery, [Shadowy Recall], does for DoTs. So, we took these two problems and came up with a change that we think will solve both of them. The result is a new Mastery, which primarily increases single-target damage. Shadow priests who want to focus on single-target damage can aim for Mastery in their gearing; or, when multi-dotting is more valuable, prefer other secondary stats over Mastery.
      
      
       * Shadow priest's Mastery ( [Shadowy Recall]) has been replaced with a new Mastery: Mental Anguish. 
          *  [Mastery: Mental Anguish]: Increases the damage of [Mind Blast], [Mind Spike], [Mind Flay], and [Mind Sear] by 20%.
         
         
       *  [Devouring Plague] now always costs 3 Shadow Orbs.
       *  [Spiritual Precision] has been removed. (See also: hit and expertise removal.)
      
      
      The cooldown of [Mind Blast] has also been adjusted to make Haste more valuable for Shadow, and removes Haste breakpoints.
      
      
       *  [Mind Blast]'s cooldown is now reduced by haste, but its base cooldown is now 9 seconds (up from 8 seconds).
      
      TALENT REVISIONS
      
      Several talents were split into different versions by specialization. We revised the effectiveness of some of these talents to better balance talent choices on their row. We also swapped the Level-15 and Level-60 talent rows so players are presented with core Priest themed abilities earlier in the leveling process.
      
      
      To get back to a balanced place, we've reapplied the AoE caps to the level-90 Talents, making them consistent with all other AoE heals, and reduced their effectiveness across the board. We've compensated for this in the tuning of Priest baseline heals.
      
      
       * Level-15 and Level-60 talent rows have swapped places.
       *  [Divine Insight]'s effects have been split based on specialization. 
          * Discipline: The effect is now based on Spirit Shell.
          * Shadow: This effect is now named Shadowy Insight.
         
         
       *  [From Darkness, Comes Light] has been split into two abilities depending on the Priest's Specialization. 
          *  [Surge of Darkness] (Shadow) now has a maximum of 3 charges (up from 2) and can now also trigger its effect from Devouring Plague, but its chance to trigger has been reduced to 10% (down from 20%) to compensate.
          *  [Surge of Light] (Discipline, Holy) activation chance has been reduced to 8% (down from 15%).
         
         
       *  [Power Infusion] now grants 25% Haste (up from 20%), but no longer increases damage (down from 5%).
       * Solace and Insanity has been split into [Power Word: Solace] for Discipline and Holy, and [Insanity] for Shadow. 
          * Insanity has been changed to cause consuming Shadow Orbs to transform Mind Flay into Insanity for 2 seconds per Shadow Orb consumed.
         
         
       *  [Twist of Fate] now only triggers from healing for Discipline and Holy Priests, and only triggers from damage for Shadow Priests.
      
      MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES
      
      First, there are a couple of quality-of-life changes for [Prayer of Mending] and [Angelic Feather]. Next is a fix for a problem with [Void Tendrils], where it lasts its full duration against creatures that had no way to attack it, such as in certain raid encounters (note that the health reduction is to keep it where it was in health, compared to player health doubling). We also removed the Mana generation from [Shadowfiend], in order to simplify it to being a burst-damage-cooldown. And last but certainly not least, we're making Holy Nova an efficient AoE healing spell for Discipline priests.
      
      
       *  [Angelic Feather] now increases movement speed by 60% (down from 80%). If cast on players, will always prefer the casting priest over others, then pick the player closest to the targeted location. If there are no players where it is targeted, it will still create a feather that can be picked up, as before. Additionally, when collecting multiple feathers, the duration will be extended instead of replaced; up to a maximum of 130% of base duration.
       *  [Enlightenment] is a new passive ability for Discipline priests. 
          * Enlightenment increases the critical healing chance of Prayer of Mending by 10%, and increases stat gains to Critical Strike from all sources by 5%.
         
         
       *  [Holy Nova] is no longer available through a Major Glyph, and is instead a Discipline specialization spell. Its mana cost has been lowered and its healing increased. It is intended as the efficient area-of-effect (AoE) healing spell for Discipline priests.
       *  [Prayer of Mending] from multiple priests can now be on the same target, and can be on multiple targets from the same priest, but the ability has a 1.5-second cast time (up from instant cast). (See also: instant cast heals)
       *  [Shadowfiend] no longer restores mana. 
          *  [Mindbender] now restores 0.75% mana per hit (down from 1.75% mana).
         
         
       *  [Void Tendrils] now have 10% of the priest's health (down from 20%), and damage dealt to the rooted target is now also dealt to the Void Tendril itself.
      
      ROGUE
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For rogues, a couple of abilities were changed to be specialization specific where they were redundant, did some thinning on cooldowns.
      
      
       *  [Disarm Trap] has been removed.
       *  [Fan of Knives] is no longer available to Combat Rogues.
       *  [Rupture] is no longer available to Combat Rogues.
       *  [Shadow Blades] has been removed.
       *  [Shadow Walk] has been removed.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Rogues received several mergers of passive abilities. There's also additional cooldown thinning with the change to Tricks of the Trade.
      
      
       *  [Assassin's Resolve] now increases damage by 10% (down from 20%).
       *  [Blindside]'s effects have been merged into baseline Mutilate.
       *  [Burst of Speed] now costs 30 Energy (up from 15 Energy).
       *  [Crimson Tempest]'s periodic damage now has rolling periodic behavior, meaning that remaining damage from the previous application is added into the newly-applied periodic-damage effect.
       *  [Cut to the Chase]'s effects have been merged into baseline Envenom.
       *  [Deadly Throw] no longer has a minimum range.
       *  [Energetic Recovery]'s effects have been merged into baseline [Slice and Dice] for Subtlety rogues.
       *  [Envenom] now increases poison chance by 30% (up from 15%).
       *  [Find Weakness]' effects have been merged into baseline [Ambush], Garrote, and [Cheap Shot] for Subtlety rogues.
       *  [Garrote] now ticks every 2 seconds (up from every 3 seconds). Damage has been adjusted to compensate.
       *  [Killing Spree] no longer increases all damage done for the duration. Its damage has been increased to compensate.
       *  [Master of Subtlety]'s effects have been merged into baseline Stealth for Subtlety rogues.
       *  [Relentless Strikes]' effects have been merged into [Ruthlessness] for Combat Rogues. It remains a separate passive for Assassination and Subtlety rogues.
       *  [Restless Blades]' effects have been merged into Ruthlessness.
       *  [Safe Fall]'s effects have been merged into baseline [Fleet Footed].
       *  [Tricks of the Trade] now has no energy cost and no longer increases damage caused by the target by 15%.
       *  [Venomous Wounds]'s effects have been merged into baseline Rupture for Assassination Rogues. It no longer triggers from Garrote and now always triggers when Rupture deals damage (up from a 75% chance).
      
      COMBO POINTS
      
      The biggest change for rogues is a fundamental change to how Combo Points work. They're now shared across all enemies; you can swap targets and you won't lose your Combo Points.
      
      
       * Combo Points for rogues are now shared across all targets and they are no longer lost when switching targets.
       *  [Redirect] has been removed.
      
      COMBAT CHANGES
      
       [Bandit's Guile] is an interesting mechanic that is important to Combat gameplay, but wasn't working out quite as well as we think that it could. In particular, there's basically no way to adjust when you're going to be in Deep Insight, other than stopping your rotation (and thus wasting energy, combo points, temporary effects, cooldown time, etc.). So, we're making an adjustment to [Revealing Strike] and Bandit's Guile. The intention here is that you can use Revealing Strike in place of [Sinister Strike] when you want to delay Deep Insight (such as to line it up with a specific upcoming fight mechanic), and have little lost damage besides the overall Deep Insight uptime. We don't expect this nuanced rotation adjustment to be used by all Combat rogues, but having a little more control over the pace of your rotation will be useful to some.
      
      
      Also worth noting here is the removal of [Ambidexterity]. This was done to reduce the amount of damage coming from auto attacks for Combat Rogues. We've increased the damage of their active abilities to compensate and make them more rewarding.
      
      
      Finally, we changed Main Gauche to accentuate the importance of the off-hand weapon for Combat.
      
      
       *  [Revealing Strike] now grants Sinister Strike a 25% chance to generate an extra Combo Point (up from 20%), but no longer advances Bandit's Guile.
       *  [Ambidexterity] has been removed.
       * Main Gauche now deals off-hand weapon damage. Its damage has been increased to compensate.
      
      AREA-OF-EFFECT ATTACKS (ASSASSINATION, COMBAT)
      
      Among some other changes to improve rogue AoE damage, we made a couple of baseline changes, and added a few Draenor Perks that impacts their AoE.
      
      
       *  [Blade Flurry] can now trigger poisons, and now deals 30% damage (down from 40%).
       *  [Seal Fate] now also grants a combo point for area attacks that critically strike the rogue's primary target.
      
      SUBTLETY CHANGES
      
       [Honor Among Thieves] is an extremely powerful ability, but has the downside that it adds significant disparity between character power while soloing and while in a group. We made this change to bring up the soloing Subtlety rogue, without having a significant impact on their performance while in a group. The passive ability Sinister Calling also received significant change to better balance scaling rates, the value of secondary stats, improve Multistrike for them, and add rotational depth.
      
      
       *  [Backstab] can now be used on either side of the target, in addition to behind the target. (See also: facing requirements)
       *  [Hemorrhage]'s periodic damage is now based on attack power (instead of the initial strike's damage), and ticks every 2 seconds. Damage has been adjusted to compensate.
       *  [Honor Among Thieves] can now also be triggered by critical hits from the rogue's melee Auto Attacks.
       *  [Sinister Calling] now increases Agility by 15% (down from 30%), and the amount of Multistrike bonus received from all sources by 5% (in order to act as Subtlety's Secondary Stat Attunement). And finally, when the rogue Multistrikes with Backstab or Ambush, they also twist the blade, causing all Bleed effects to advance by 2 seconds, triggering an instant tick.
      
      SUBTERFUGE
      
       [Subterfuge] has proved too powerful, and frustrating to play against in PvP, so we decided to reduce its defensive capabilities, while preserving its offensive power. We changed the Subterfuge period to allow the use of [Stealth] abilities without actually stealthing you, similar to [Shadow Dance].
      
      
       *  [Subterfuge] now allows you to use abilities that require [Stealth] for 3 seconds after leaving Stealth, instead of actually staying stealthed for 3 seconds.
      
      SHAMAN
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For shaman, we removed some niche abilities, and also split out a few abilities by specialization.
      
      
       *  [Ancestral Awakening] has been removed.
       *  [Ancestral Vigor] has been removed.
       *  [Burning Wrath] has been removed.
       *  [Chain Heal] is now available only to Restoration shaman.
       *  [Earth Shock] is now available only to Elemental shaman. Enhancement and Restoration shaman should use Frost Shock in its place.
       *  [Earthliving Weapon] has been removed.
       *  [Elemental Focus] has been removed.
       *  [Feral Spirit]'s Spirit Wolves no longer have the Spirit Bite ability.
       *  [Healing Wave] has been removed.
       *  [Lava Burst] now replaces Primal Strike for Elemental and Restoration shaman.
       *  [Magma Totem] is now available only to Enhancement shaman.
       *  [Mana Tide Totem] has been removed. Restoration shaman Mana costs have been adjusted to compensate.
       *  [Primal Wisdom] has been removed. Enhancement shaman mana regeneration has been increased by 100% to compensate. [It is believed this note is in error, and should refer to [Mental Quickness]. Primal Wisdom was already removed in Patch 5.0.4.]
       *  [Rockbiter Weapon] has been removed.
       *  [Spiritwalker's Grace] is no longer available to Enhancement shaman.
       *  [Static Shock] has been removed.
       *  [Searing Flames] has been removed. 
          *  [Flametongue Weapon] damage has been increased by 40%, and Lava Lash damage has been increased to 280% weapon damage (up from 140%) to compensate.
         
         
       *  [Water Shield] is now available only to Restoration shaman, and replaces Lightning Shield.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Shaman had a number of extra abilities that were consolidated to provide a smoother rotation flow. Mana regeneration and mana costs for Elemental and Enhancement were made compensate for abilities removed via Ability Pruning. The removal of Weapon Imbues was significant. There was always one right answer for each specialization, and so we made the appropriate Weapon Imbue passive to each spec, or tuned abilities around its removal.
      
      
      Finally, there's the removal of Rolling Thunder. In concept, this is a simple merger of Rolling Thunder into Fulmination, but also with some consolidation of its effects; the mana recovery component was removed along with other mana changes, and the random chance was removed while maximum stack size was increased to compensate. The randomness in Rolling Thunder became redundant, because there already was a source of randomness in Elemental Overload now that Multistrikes trigger it.
      
      
       *  [Ancestral Spirit]'s mana cost has been reduced by 95%.
       *  [Elemental Fury] has been removed. Elemental shaman now naturally have critical strike damage increased to 250% of normal damage.
       *  [Echo of the Elements] has been redesigned. The shaman's spells and abilities have a chance to trigger Echo of the Elements, causing their next short-cooldown spell or ability to not trigger a cooldown. 
          * Elemental: It may be used on Frost Shock, Earthquake, or Lava Burst. [It is believed the note is in error, as Frost Shock has been mentioned on this same page as no longer being available to Elemental. The author most likely meant Earth Shock.]
          * Enhancement: It may be used on Fire Nova, Lava Lash, or Stormstrike.
          * Restoration: It may be used on Unleash Life, Purify Spirit, or Riptide.
         
         
       *  [Elemental Mastery] now has a 2-minute cooldown (up from 1.5 minute).
       *  [Elemental Oath] and Unleashed Rage have been removed. 
          *  [Grace of Air] now also provides 5% Haste to all party and raid members.
         
         
       *  [Flametongue Weapon] and Windfury Weapon have been removed. 
          *  [Enhanced Weapons] is a new passive ability available to Enhancement shaman, causing main-hand weapon attacks to have a chance to trigger 3 extra attacks, and off-hand weapon attacks to deal additional fire damage.
          *  [Lava Lash]'s damage done is no longer increased by Flametongue Weapon, and its damage has been increased to compensate.
         
         
       *  [Flurry]'s duration has been increased to 30 seconds.
       *  [Frost Shock] no longer generates additional threat.
       *  [Greater Healing Wave] has been renamed to Healing Wave.
       *  [Healing Tide Totem] now heals all party or raid members, but amount healed per target has been reduced to compensate.
       *  [Lava Lash] now spreads Flame Shock to up to 6 nearby enemies (up from 4 enemies).
       *  [Rolling Thunder] has been removed. 
          * Elemental shaman Mana regeneration has been increased by 50% to compensate.
          *  [Fulmination] now causes Elemental Blast, Lightning Bolt, and Chain Lightning damage and multistrike damage to always generate an additional Lightning Shield charge, up to a maximum of 15. Earth Shock will consume any charges beyond 1, dealing their total damage to the enemy target.
         
         
       *  [Shamanistic Rage] no longer reduces Mana costs while active.
       *  [Thunderstorm] no longer regenerates Mana.
       * Totems will no longer cause hostile creatures to enter combat with the shaman based on proximity.
       *  [Unleash Elements] has been split into different versions based on specialization. 
          * Unleash Elements is now available only to Enhancement shaman, and now increases attack speed by 60% (up from 50%), and increases the damage of the shaman's next Fire spell by 40% (up from 30%), but no longer deals direct damage or requires an enemy target.
          *  [Unleash Flame] has been made into a separate ability available only to Elemental shaman, and now increases the damage of the shaman's next Fire spell by 40% (up from 30%), but no longer deals direct damage or requires an enemy target.
          *  [Unleash Life] has been made into a separate ability available only to Restoration shaman, and now heals an ally and increases the effect of the shaman's next direct heal by 30%.
          *  [Unleashed Fury] now provides similar benefits, but applied as buffs to the shaman instead of debuffing an enemy. For Enhancement shaman, it now grants 5% increase Multistrike chance instead of causing auto-attacks to trigger Static Shock.
         
         
       *  [Water Shield] now only triggers from melee attacks. 
          * Mana costs for Restoration shaman have been adjusted to compensate.
         
         
       *  [Resurgence] no longer requires Water Shield to be active.
      
      ELEMENTAL AND ENHANCEMENT CHANGES
      
      For Elemental and Enhancement, we had a few problems to solve. Enhancement suffers from having their damage split among so many damage sources that none of it feels impressive. We changed the damage of several abilities to try to reorganize their damage into fewer, more impactful abilities, while keeping the net total the same. For a long time Elemental shaman was one of the specializations most impacted by movement, at a time where other casters were increasingly able to cast while moving.
      
      
      In Warlords of Draenor, we're pulling back on the ability for many casters to deal damage while moving, and that includes Elemental. They will still have some ability to deal damage while moving, through Shocks, [Unleash Elements], and instant Lava Bursts. For [Chain Lightning], we wanted to reduce the impact of Haste soft capping, and so changed [Shamanism] to increase damage instead of reduce cast time. Additionally, we simplified [Wind Shear] by removing its impact on threat, which no longer matters.
      
      
       *  [Ascendance] for the Enhancement specialization now changes the shaman's auto attacks and [Stormstrike] to deal Wind-based physical damage that bypasses armor.
       *  [Earth Elemental Totem] deals 90% less Auto Attack damage but generates 1000% more threat.
       *  [Elemental Precision] has been removed. (See also: hit and expertise removal.)
       *  [Feral Spirit]'s damage has been increased by 300%.
       *  [Fire Nova] now has a cooldown of 4.5 second (up from 4.0 seconds).
       *  [Flurry] has been redesigned. Melee haste effects now reduce the global cooldown and cooldowns of Earth Shock, Fire Nova, Flame Shock, Frost Shock, Lava Lash, Static Shock, Stormstrike, and Unleash Elements.
       *  [Lava Lash] now has a cooldown of 10.5 seconds (up from 10 seconds).
       *  [Lightning Bolt] can no longer be cast while moving by default. Effects like [Spiritwalker's Grace] can still make the spell able to be cast while moving.
       *  [Magma Totem]'s damage has been increased by 100%, and now ticks faster with Haste.
       *  [Maelstrom Weapon]'s chance to trigger has been reduced by 20%.
       * Primal Earth Elemental's Pulverize ability no longer deals damage.
       *  [Searing Totem]'s Searing Bolt now has a 2-second cast time (up from 1.5 seconds), but casts faster with Haste, and its damage has been increased by 120%.
       *  [Shamanism] no longer reduces the cast time of [Chain Lightning], but instead now increases the damage of Chain Lightning by 100% (up from 70%).
       *  [Spiritual Insight] no longer increases the chance to hit with Lightning Bolt, Lava Burst, Hex, or Flame Shock. (See also: hit and expertise removal.)
       *  [Stormstrike] now has a cooldown of 7.5 seconds (down from 8 seconds).
       *  [Wind Shear] no longer affects threat.
       *  [Windfury Weapon] no longer has a 3-second internal cooldown.
      
      ELEMENTAL OVERLOAD AND MOLTEN EARTH
      
      One of the new secondary stats, Multistrike, functions very similarly to Elemental Overload. We wanted to keep Mastery and Multistrike feeling distinct, but also know how iconic and important Elemental Overload is for Elemental Shaman. So, we decided to merge the two together with Multistrike driving Elemental Overload, and give the Elemental specialization a new Mastery. For the new Mastery, we wanted to strengthen the Elemental Shaman's connection to earth energies, and added damage that continues while the Shaman is moving. The summary of all this is that if you liked Mastery before, favor Multistrike instead for the same effect. Or try out the new Mastery: Molten Earth. Chain Lightning and Earthquake were also improved significantly to offset the fact that Elemental Overload was a massive buff to it, but Molten Earth is not.
      
      
       *  [Elemental Overload] is now a regular passive ability and is no longer increased by Mastery. It grants 35% increased Multistrike damage and healing, and an additional 20% to Multistrike chance. It also increases the amount of the Multistrike stat gains from all sources by 5%, serving as Elemental's Secondary Stat attunement.
       *  [Mastery: Molten Earth] is a new Mastery for Elemental Shaman. 
          * Molten Earth causes the Shaman's damaging spells to incite the earth around to come to their aid for 6 seconds, repeatedly dealing Fire damage to their most recently attacked target.
         
         
       *  [Chain Lightning]'s damage has been increased by 50%.
       *  [Earthquake]'s damage has been increased by 33%.
      
      RESTORATION CHANGES
      
      Restoration shaman had the most passive and smart healing of any healer, and so received some reductions in that area, along with buffs elsewhere to keep them competitive.
      
      
       *  [Chain Heal] now heals each chain target for 10% less than the previous target.
       *  [Conductivity] is no longer triggered by damaging spells for Restoration shaman, or by healing spells for non-Restoration shaman.
       *  [Elemental Blast] now also grants increased Spirit for Restoration Shaman, in addition to the random secondary stat. Spirit amount granted is equal to double the random secondary stat amount.
       * Multiple Earth Shields can now be applied to the same target.
       *  [Earthliving Weapon] now increases healing done by 5% (instead of increasing healing Spell Power by a flat amount).
       *  [Healing Stream Totem]'s mana cost has been reduced to 10% of base mana (down from 23.5%), and its healing has been reduced by 50%.
       *  [Riptide]'s healing has been adjusted to put significantly more of it into the initial heal. The initial heal amount has been increased by 70%, while the periodic healing amount has been reduced by 20%.
       *  [Tidal Waves] now reduces the cast time of [Healing Wave] by 20% (down from 30%).
       *  [Unleash Life] no longer increases the healing from [Healing Rain] but its direct healing has been increased by 100%.
       *  [Glyph of Chaining] no longer causes [Chain Heal] to have a 2-second cooldown.
       *  [Glyph of Totemic Recall] now only increases the mana returned from recalling your totems by 25% (down from 75%).
      
      MISCELLANEOUS
      
      We also made a couple quality of life improvements to shaman Shield spells.
      
      
       *  [Lightning Shield] now persists through death.
       *  [Water Shield] now persists through death.
      
      WARLOCK
      
      Warlocks received some polish but remain relatively unchanged. They saw the most change of any class in Mists of Pandaria, and so were in need of less revision this time around.
      
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For warlocks, that primarily focused on removing niche abilities.
      
      
       *  [Curse of the Elements] has been removed.
       *  [Demonic Rebirth] has been removed.
       *  [Drain Life] is no longer available to Destruction warlocks. 
          *  [Harvest Life] has been replaced with a new talent called Searing Flames for Destruction warlocks. 
             *  [Searing Flames] reduces [Ember Tap]'s Burning Ember cost by 50%, and increases its healing by 50%.
            
            
         
         
       * Metamorphosis: [Void Ray] has been removed.
       *  [Seed of Corruption] now replaces Rain of Fire for Affliction warlocks.
       *  [Twilight Ward] has been removed.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Soulburn had several extremely niche spell amplifications which were removed. We distinguished Hand of Gul'dan and Chaos Wave further by removing the snare from the former and improving the snare of the latter. Beyond that, there was a simple consolidation of some abilities.
      
      
       * All of the various [Soulburn] effects are now learned together with Soulburn, instead of at different levels. 
          *  [Drain Life] no longer gains a benefit from Soulburn.
          *  [Health Funnel] no longer gains a benefit from Soulburn.
          *  [Unending Breath] no longer gains a benefit from Soulburn.
         
         
       *  [Hand of Gul'dan] no longer snares the enemy. 
          *  [Chaos Wave] now reduces enemy movement speed by 50%.
         
         
       *  [Decimation]'s effects have been merged into baseline [Soul Fire] and [Shadow Bolt].
       *  [Fel Armor]'s effects have been merged into [Blood Pact].
       *  [Grimoire of Supremacy] pets now generates 20% more [Demonic Fury].
       *  [Malefic Grasp] has been removed. Its effects have been merged into [Drain Soul] which Affliction warlocks should use in its place.
       *  [Nightfall]'s effects have been merged into baseline Corruption for Affliction warlocks and now has a 6% chance to trigger (down from 10%).
       *  [Pyroclasm]'s effects have been merged into baseline [Backdraft].
       *  [Seed of Corruption] and [Soulburn: Seed of Corruption] can no longer both apply to the same target.
      
      RAID UTILITY
      
      We felt that warlocks brought too much unique raid utility, so decided to tone down Healthstones and [Demonic Gateway]. We moved healing potions and Healthstones into a cooldown of their own, and made them usable once per combat.
      
      
       * Demonic Gateways no longer have charges (up from being limited to 5 charges). Every party or raid member can use them once every 90 seconds (up from 45 seconds). The maximum distance apart they can be placed is now 40 yards (down from 70 yards).
       *  [Healthstone]'s cooldown will now not reset until the player leaves combat. Healing from this ability is now a flat amount (instead of a % of maximum health) and can no longer be a Critical Effect.
      
      AFFLICTION CHANGES
      
      For Affliction, we're happy with their rotation. But, [Drain Soul] was causing them to be too strong in situations where they had a steady supply of small creatures to kill. We reduced the effectiveness of its on-kill effect in order to solve this. Additionally, Soul Swap was changed to cost 1 Soul Shard to push it into its intended role of being a more expensive but faster method of applying your periodic damage effects, and better balance it against Haunt.
      
      
       *  [Drain Soul] now creates 1 Soul Shard (down from 4 Soul Shards) when the target dies.
       *  [Haunt] now increases periodic damage by 30% (down from 35%).
       *  [Soul Swap] now costs 1 Soul Shard (up from none). 
          *  [Soulburn]: Soul Swap costs a total of 2 Soul Shards (up from 1).
         
         
      
      DEMONOLOGY CHANGES
      
      We were unsatisfied with Grimoire of Sacrifice for Demonology. Fundamentally, it did not fit Demonology's theme to sacrifice their pet, full time. We had toyed with ideas where it acted as a temporary cooldown for Demonology, but have decided to replace it with a new talent, which is more theme-appropriate, and fits well against the competition in that talent row. We also tweaked the design of Master Demonologist, in order to solve some edge cases, and simplify and clarify its effects.
      
      
       *  [Mastery: Master Demonologist] has been slightly changed. It now passively increases all damage by 6% regardless of form. While in Metamorphosis, it further increases the damage of Touch of Chaos, Chaos Wave, Doom, Immolation Aura, and Soul Fire while by 12%.
       * Demon pets controlled by Demonology warlocks now deal 20% more damage.
       *  [Grimoire of Sacrifice] is no longer available to Demonology warlocks and has a new talent, Grimoire of Synergy in its place. 
          *  [Grimoire of Synergy]: When the warlock or their demon deals damage, there is a chance to trigger Demonic Synergy, granting the other one 15% increased damage for 15 seconds.
         
         
      
      MOVEMENT ABILITIES
      
      We've reduced the ability for ranged damage dealers to deal damage while moving in Warlords. Kil'jaeden's Cunning became a problematic talent because its mobility made warlocks much stronger compared to other casters. We redesigned how the ability works to be more powerful in bursts instead of always affecting only some spells.
      
      
       *  [Kil'jaeden's Cunning] has been redesigned. Kil'jaeden's Cunning calls upon the cunning of Kil'jaeden to permit movement while casting Warlock spells. This spell may be cast while casting other spells and lasts 8 seconds with a 1-minute cooldown.
       *  [Fel Flame] was removed.
      
      MISCELLANEOUS
      
      Finally, there are a couple of miscellaneous changes. For Drain Life, we reduced the base healing somewhat, but massively increased the effectiveness of the Glyph which increases its healing, so as to help open up more potential Drain Life use in ideal situations. And lastly, we simplified Shadowburn a bit.
      
      
       *  [Drain Life] now heals for 30% less than before.
       *  [Shadowburn] no longer generates any mana.
       *  [Glyph of Drain Life] now increases the healing of Drain Life by 100% (up from 30%).
      
      WARRIOR
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For warriors, we focused on removing abilities that were redundant, and making some tweaks to their rotations.
      
      
       *  [Berserker Stance] has been removed.
       *  [Cleave] has been removed.
       *  [Colossus Smash] is now available only to Arms warriors.
       *  [Deep Wounds] is now available only to Protection warriors.
       *  [Demoralizing Banner] has been removed.
       *  [Flurry] has been removed.
       *  [Mocking Banner] is now available only to Protection warriors.
       *  [Mortal Strike] now replaces Heroic Strike for Arms warriors.

       *  [Thunder Clap] is no longer available to Fury warriors.
       *  [Whirlwind] is now available only to Arms and Fury warriors.
      
      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
       *  [Battle Shout] now lasts 1 hour and no longer generates Rage.
       *  [Blood and Thunder]'s effects have been merged into baseline Deep Wounds for Protection warriors.
       *  [Charge] no longer generates Rage when charging against a non-player target multiple times in a row. Charge will still always generate Rage when used against other players.
       * Commanding Shout now lasts 1 hour and no longer generates Rage.
       *  [Defensive Stance] now reduces damage taken by 20% (down from 25%).
       *  [Demoralizing Shout] now lasts 8 seconds (down from 10 seconds).
       *  [Last Stand] now lasts 12 seconds (down from 20 seconds). [This is believed to be a typo. It had been reduced to 15 seconds, not 12.]
       *  [Shield Wall] now lasts 8 seconds (down from 12 seconds).
       *  [Single-Minded Fury]'s effects have been merged into Crazed Berserker.
       *  [Titan's Grip]'s effects have been merged into Crazed Berserker.
       *  [Crazed Berserker] now increases all damage by 30% (up from 20%) while using one-handed weapons.
       *  [Hamstring] now costs 10 Rage and deals 20% weapon damage, in addition to the movement speed slow. [This is believed to be a typo. It already cost 10 rage and the added weapon damage was only 5%]
       *  [Meat Cleaver]'s effects have been merged into baseline Whirlwind for Fury warriors.
       *  [Seasoned Soldier] now increases damage by 10% (down from 15%).
       *  [Sword and Board]'s effects have been merged into baseline Devastate.
       *  [Thunder Clap] now costs 10 Rage, and also reduces the movement speed of nearby enemies by 50% for 6 sec.
       *  [Ultimatum]'s effects have been merged into baseline Shield Slam.
      
      STANCE CHANGES
      
      Warriors have always had stances; they're very important to the feeling of being a warrior. In order to make stances more meaningful, and ease keybinds, we made stances have their own action bars, and re-added stance restrictions on abilities. However, we also made it so that you'll automatically be shifted into the appropriate stance if you try to use an ability that isn't usable in your current stance. One important difference between this and previous incarnations of warrior stances is that these abilities are rotational, not utility cooldowns. Stances are now more for different gameplay modes (dealing damage vs. tanking). There shouldn't be cases where you find yourself swapping stances, use an ability, and then immediately swapping back.
      
      
       * Warrior Stances now once again have their own action bars. 
          * Attempting to use an ability that requires a different stance will now automatically switch to that stance.
         
         
       *  [Colossus Smash] now requires Battle Stance.
       *  [Recklessness] now requires Battle Stance.
       *  [Sweeping Strikes] now requires Battle Stance.
       *  [Shield Barrier] is now available for all Warrior specializations (was Protection only) and requires Defensive Stance. 
          * For Arms and Fury warriors, Shield Barrier can be used without a shield.
         
         
      
      ARMS CHANGES
      
      We wanted to fix a few problems with Warriors. Prominently, we still weren't happy with Arms' rotation (and neither were many players), so we've made some more changes. The goal is to remove needless complexity while simultaneously adding more depth. As mentioned in the above section on Ability Pruning, Overpower and Heroic Strike have been removed for Arms warriors.
      
      
      In addition, we weren't satisfied with the Mastery for Arms. The intended flavor for Arms is about hitting with few, big, and heavy weapon strikes. Strikes of Opportunity actually went opposite of that, adding frequent little hits. We've replaced Strikes of Opportunity with a new Mastery which accentuates their intended design.
      
      
       *  [Battle Stance] for Arms warriors now generates 115% more Rage from auto-attacks and Critical Strikes now generate double Rage.
       *  [Defensive Stance] for Arms warriors now generates 50% as much Rage from auto-attacks as in [Battle Stance].
       * Arms warriors now generate Rage from taking auto-attack damage. Each 1% of health taken as damage will generate 1 Rage, up to 5 Rage per hit.
       * Mastery: [Strikes of Opportunity] has been removed, and replaced with a new ability, Mastery: Weapons Master. 
          *  [Mastery: Weapons Master] increases the damage of [Colossus Smash], [Mortal Strike], and [Execute] abilities by 28% (increasing with Mastery).
         
         
       *  [Colossus Smash] now costs 20 Rage, deals 225% increased damage, and no longer increases the damage of Slam.
       *  [Enrage] is no longer available to Arms warriors.
       *  [Execute] for Arms warriors now costs 10 Rage, and consumes up to 30 additional Rage to deal additional damage.
       *  [Mortal Strike] now costs 20 Rage (instead of generating 10 Rage).
       *  [Overpower] has been removed. Arms warriors should now use Rend and Whirlwind instead.
       *  [Rend] is a new ability for Arms warriors. 
          * Rend causes bleed damage over 18 seconds, and a final burst of bleed damage when the effect expires. Costs 5 Rage.
         
         
       *  [Slam] has been removed. Arms Warriors should now use Rend and Whirlwind instead.
       *  [Sweeping Strikes] now costs 10 Rage (down from 30 Rage).
       *  [Sudden Death] has been removed.
       *  [Unbridled Wrath] has been removed.
       *  [Whirlwind] now costs 20 Rage for Arms Warriors.
      
      BURST DAMAGE COOLDOWNS
      
      As with other classes, we wanted to reduce cooldown stacking. Cutting [Skull Banner] did a ton to help that across the whole game. But for warriors specifically, we needed to make further changes, including merging some of the personal benefit of Skull Banner back into [Recklessness]. Also, to make up for [Throw] being removed, we modified [Heroic Throw] to be more frequently usable.
      
      
       *  [Heroic Throw] is now a high-threat ability, generating 300% extra threat, has a 6-second cooldown (down from 30 seconds), but now has a 15 yard minimum range. [This is believed to be a typo. The minimum range was increased to 8 yards, not 15.]
       *  [Recklessness] now increases Critical Strike chance by 15% (down from 30%) and increases Critical Strike damage by 10% (up from 0%).
       *  [Shattering Throw] no longer reduces the armor of the target; it only does damage and breaks immunities. 
          * It also is no longer learned via any specialization, but instead through a new Major Glyph, [Glyph of Shattering Throw].
         
         
      
      HASTE FOR WARRIORS
      
      Haste has long been a problematic stat for warriors, usually being of little value. As part of our commitment to ensuring all secondary stats are valuable (except Bonus Armor for non-tanks and Spirit for non-healers, of course), we're making a significant change to warriors, to ensure that Haste has strong, competitive value. We're giving all warriors a new passive, which lets haste affect their global cooldown, and the cooldowns of their very-short-cooldown rotational abilities.
      
      
       *  [Headlong Rush] is a new passive ability for warriors: 
          * Headlong Rush: Haste reduces global cooldown and the cooldowns of [Mortal Strike], [Bloodthirst], [Shield Slam], and [Thunder Clap].
         
         
      
      PROTECTION CHANGES
      
      Protection warriors have received a few notable changes. First, we removed Dodge and Parry from gear, and expect Protection warriors to value Haste and Critical Strike as important secondary stats. In order to achieve that, we made [Riposte] give defensive value to Critical Strike. The aforementioned [Headlong Rush] also helps for valuing Haste.
      
      
       *  [Mastery: Critical Block] now increases critical block chance by 12% (down from 17.6%).
       *  [Blood Craze] is a new passive ability for Protection warriors. 
          * Blood Craze causes Multistrike auto attacks to trigger a Blood Craze, which regenerates 3% of the Warrior's health over 3 seconds. When this effect is refreshed, the remaining duration is added to the new effect.
         
         
       *  [Riposte] has been redesigned. 
          * Riposte now gives the warrior Parry equal to their Critical Strike bonus from gear.
         
         
       *  [Shield Block] now regenerates a new charge every 12 seconds (up from every 9 seconds).
       *  [Unwavering Sentinel] no longer increases Armor, but now also reduces the chance for attacks to be parried by 3%. (See also: hit and expertise removal.)
      
      TALENT CHANGES
      
      A few warrior talents also were in need of revision. First, [Second Wind] was problematic; it was sometimes too weak, and sometimes too strong. We chose to change it from a passive health regeneration effect to the new Leech effect, so that low-health warriors have to maintain combat in order to benefit, instead of kiting, hiding, or otherwise playing defensively. Enraged Regeneration was changed to account for the removal of Enrage from Arms.
      
      
      The level-45 talent row was removed for crowd-control disarmament reasons, and also wanted to allow you to choose more rotational complexity through talents. We replaced the row with new talents, many of which are specialization-specific, giving you a variety of playstyle choices for your warrior.
      
      
      For the level-60 and level-90 talent rows, certain combinations were proving problematic. We decided that [Storm Bolt] would better compete with [Shockwave] and [Dragon Roar], and that [Bladestorm] would better compete with Avatar and [Bloodbath], so swapped Storm Bolt and Bladestorm's positions. We also adjusted the effects of a few talents in order to make them more competitive with the talents on their row.
      
      
       *  [Bladestorm] is now a level-90 talent, swapping places with [Storm Bolt]. 
          * Bladestorm no longer allows use of Shouts except [Demoralizing Shout] while active. It does still allow the use of Taunt, [Enraged Regeneration], [Shield Wall], and [Last Stand].
         
         
       *  [Enraged Regeneration] now heals for 100% more but the amount healed is no longer increased by being Enraged.
       *  [Dragon Roar]'s damage is no longer reduced when hitting more than 1 target.
       *  [Mass Spell Reflection]'s cooldown has been reduced to 30 seconds, but it now replaces [Spell Reflection].
       *  [Second Wind] no longer directly heals the warrior while active. Instead, Second Wind grants the warrior 10% Leech while active, which causes the warrior to heal for 10% of all damage and healing done by the warrior while active.
       *  [Storm Bolt] is now a level-60 talent, swapping places with Bladestorm.
       *  [Staggering Shout] has been removed and replaced with 3 new talents that vary by specialization. 
          * Arms: [Taste for Blood]: Each time Rend deals damage, gain 3 Rage.
          * Fury: [Furious Strikes]: Wild Strike costs 25 less Rage.
          * Protection: [Heavy Repercussions]: Shield Slam deals 30% additional damage while Shield Block or Shield Charge is active.
         
         
       *  [Piercing Howl] has been removed and replaced with a new talent, Sudden Death. 
          *  [Sudden Death] causes auto-attack hits to have a 10% chance to make the next Execute free and useable on any target, regardless of health level. These Executes do not consume additional Rage to deal additional damage.
          *  [Piercing Howl] is now available to all Fury Warriors as a baseline ability.
         
         
       *  [Disrupting Shout] has been removed and replaced with 3 new talents that vary by specialization. 
          * Arms: [Slam]: Slam an opponent, causing 100% weapon damage. Each consecutive use of Slam increases the damage dealt by 50% and Rage cost by 100%. Requires Battle Stance. [Note: Does not require Battle Stance.]
          * Fury: [Unquenchable Thirst]: Bloodthirst no longer has a cooldown.
          * Protection: [Unyielding Strikes]: Devastate reduces the cost of Heroic Strike by 5 Rage for 5 seconds, stacking up to 6 times. Once this effect reaches 6 applications, its duration will no longer refresh.
         
         
      
      FURY CHANGES
      
      To better separate the playstyles between Fury and Arms warriors, we've made several significant changes to Fury warriors and make them a better fit for the specialization's theme: a relentless, bloodthirsty berserker. In particular, Colossus Smash and Heroic Strike was removed, since those abilities resulted in gameplay that was the complete opposite of that intended style. Wild Strike was modified to fill the role of a quick excess Rage dump. We also felt that auto attack damage had become too high and moved some of that damage into Execute. Execute has been changed to now deal damage based on Weapon Damage instead of just Attack Power. Finally, we've updated some to spell alerts to improve usability.
      
      
       *  [Bloodsurge]'s effects have been merged into baseline Bloodthirst and no longer reduce Wild Strike's global cooldown. Its spell alert has moved to the top slot instead of the left and right slots, and now has 2 charges (down from 3 charges).
       *  [Bloodthirst] now replaces Heroic Strike for Fury Warriors. 
          * Wild Strike now has a 0.75 second baseline global cooldown, and costs 45 Rage.
         
         
       * Bloodthirst now has 30% additional Critical Strike chance (instead of double the normal Critical Strike chance).
       *  [Crazed Berserker] no longer increases auto attack damage. Instead, it also causes Execute to hit with the off-hand weapon.
       *  [Raging Blow] now extends the duration of Colossus Smash by 2 seconds, and has a spell alert on the left and right slots. [This is believed to be in error, as Colossus Smash was made exclusive to the Arms specialization in this same patch]
       *  [Glyph of Colossus Smash] is a new glyph available to Fury warriors. The glyph increases the duration of Colossus Smash's effect to 20 seconds, but reduces its effectiveness. [This is believed to be in error, as Glyph of Colossus Smash was removed in this same patch without anything replacing it.]
      
      ENRAGE AND DEEP WOUNDS
      
      We also expanded [Enrage] to affect all damage, not just Physical damage, and increased its duration slightly so that it can cover burst windows like Colossus Smash adequately. We're also making a change to the design of [Deep Wounds], to try to limit is effectiveness in PvP, without hurting its effectiveness in PvE.
      
      
       *  [Mastery: Unshackled Fury] (Fury) now increases all damage (up from only Physical damage).
       *  [Deep Wounds] now lasts 15 seconds, or until the target is healed to full health.
       *  [Enrage] now increases all damage (up from only Physical damage).
      
      ADDITIONAL CHANGES
      WORLD ENVIRONMENT
      
       * Nighttime environments for some areas received lighting adjustments to make them more night like.
       * Cross-realm zones have been enabled for the continent of Pandaria.
       * Classic starting areas (Levels 1-10) received a number of improvements to the tutorial, quests, and creature/NPC tuning to provide a smoother starting experience.
      
      
      Creatures
      
      
       * Kor'kron guards and forces loyal to Garrosh have been ousted from Horde cities and settlements.
       * Access to Ordon Sanctuary or eligibility for loot from Ordos no longer requires players to have completed the Legendary Cloak questline. 
          * Spoke too soon. The change below has been reverted. Eligibility for loot from defeating Ordos has not changed. It still requires one of the characters on an account license to have obtained the Legendary Cloak. -Rygarius
         
         
      
      
      Isle of Thunder
      
      
       * Troves of the Thunder King has been retired and associated achievements have been converted into Feats of Strength.
       *  [Key to the Palace of Lei Shen] has been removed. [Elder Charm of Good Fortune] will now drop in place of the key.
      
      QUESTS
      
       *  [90] Warforged Seals is no longer a weekly quest. Players can now redeem as many Warforged Seals as they have Lesser Charms of Good Fortune for!
       * Warlocks that have successfully completed [90] Infiltrating the Black Temple by defeating Kanrethad Ebonlocke before patch 6.0.2 will receive a special title.
      
      
      Legendary Cloak Quest Line
      
      
       * As part of the transition from Mists of Pandaria to Warlords of Draenor, players who are not already on the Legendary Cloak quest line will no longer be able to begin it.
       * Players that are already on the Legendary Cloak quest line have until November 13 to complete Wrathion's tasks and challenges. Once Warlords of Draenor launches, the Legendary Cloak quest line will be gone entirely—the quests and the cloak will no longer be obtainable, and any related in-progress quests will be cleared from the quest log.
       * Characters will continue to be able to repurchase rewards they've already obtained (such as the epic cloak and Legendary metagem) from the quest line.
       *  [90] A Test of Valor has been removed. Players on Wrathion's Legendary quest line will now skip ahead to the next step.
       * Full details of the changes can be found in the blog titled: Legendary Cloak Quest Last Chance – Black Prince Buff Extended.
      
      RAIDS, DUNGEONS, AND SCENARIOS
      
      Valor and Justice Point Removal
      
      
       *  [Valor Points] and [Justice Points] have been removed.
       * Most items that formerly had a Valor and Justice Point cost now cost gold instead.
       * Valor and Justice Points remaining on a character will be converted into gold at a rate of 47 silver per point.
      
      
      Personal Loot for Raids

      CLASS CHANGES
      TALENT BALANCE
      
      Developer Commentary: A primary focus for class changes in Patch 6.1 is improving overall talent balance. Not every talent needs to be useful in every situation; and in fact it's often better if they have strengths and weaknesses. But we do try to have each talent be useful in some situations, and make them close enough in value that if you really enjoy the gameplay of a talent you don't feel like you're dragging your group down by using it.
      
      
      For these changes we focused primarily on tuning (tweaking numbers), and nearly all changes are buffs to underperforming talents. The goal is to reach more variety of viable builds, without bringing down the existing popular choices.
      
      
       * Death knight 
          * Talents 
             *  [Breath of Sindragosa] no longer has an initial Runic Power cost, but only applies the Mark of Sindragosa for Blood death knights.

             *  [Hurricane Strike] (Windwalker) damage increased by 25%.

      HEALER DAMAGE
      
      Developer Commentary: Another change being made for Patch 6.1 is to bring the damage potential of healers up to a level that is sufficient and balanced.

NEW CONTENT
NEW KARAZHAN MYTHIC DUNGEON

From the moment of its mysterious creation, the purpose of this dark tower has been intertwined with the history of the Guardians of Tirisfal, once Azeroth's greatest bulwark against the Legion. It is now best known as the home of Medivh, who tragically betrayed Azeroth and brought the unbroken chain of Guardians to an end. This legacy makes Karazhan a place of particular interest for the Legion, who have descended in full force in an effort to open a new front in their war on the denizens of Azeroth.


Gather a party of five seasoned adventurers and return to this legendary dungeon to face eight bosses on Mythic difficulty. It's an experience that may turn you upside-down!

NEW TRIAL OF VALOR RAID

Since Loken's betrayal, Odyn has been trapped within the Halls of Valor as Helya plots in the shadows to claim the souls of his valarjar champions. In recent days, however, great heroes have arrived in the lands of Stormheim in the Legion's wake. Hoping that their might and determination could tip the scales and end Helya's reign, Odyn summons these champions for a final test.


This new three-boss raid dungeon completes the story of Stormheim. Odyn, Guarm, and Helya will become available in Normal and Heroic difficulties two weeks after the launch of Patch 7.1, with Mythic and Raid Finder Difficulties opening afterward.

THE CONTINUING SURAMAR CAMPAIGN

Your heroic efforts in Suramar continue with a series of quests that unlock over a period of nine weeks, ultimately leading you to the very entrance of the Nighthold. Delve into the story of the Nightfallen insurrection against the Nightborne and their Legion allies, and you can obtain the wondrous Arcanist's Manasaber mount. Look for the quest "Lockdown" to get started.

NEW WORLD QUESTS

A new questline that will unlock Helarjar World Quests is now available. Look for “A Call to Action” in Dalaran to discover the depth of Helya's influence on all of the Broken Isles and contribute to the resistance.


Falcosaurs are here! The coastline of the Broken Isles is under assault from an invasive, predatory species, and they're breeding out of control! Falcosaurs drop Falcosaur Eggs and Falcosaur Feathers, reagents for new First Aid and Cooking recipes. Save an Orphaned Falcosaur pet to begin a journey toward understanding these hungry creatures, and you might find yourself with a unique new mount.

UPDATED FEATURES
ARTIFACT KNOWLEDGE AND CLASS HALL UPDATES

New Bind-on-Account items are available from the Artifact Researcher in your Class Order Hall. These items can be sent to alternate characters to immediately get them to higher Artifact Knowledge levels.


For new players just reaching 110, there is a new set of repeatable quests that will allow you to immediately exchange Order Hall Resources for Artifact Knowledge up to Artifact Knowledge level 15.


The time it takes to complete Class Hall research has been reduced. A shorter time to complete Class Hall research for Tiers 3, 4, 5, and 6 will make it easier to upgrade your Class Halls on alts and new characters.

FIND PREMADE GROUPS FROM THE QUEST TRACKER

When you're looking for players that are doing the same World Quest, you can now easily search for groups in the Quest Tracker. For group quests, a small button will appear next to the quest name. For all other quests, right click the quest name and then click "Find Group." This will automatically launch a search for groups of players who are doing that quest. If none are found, you can start a group with one click – all the details will be filled in for you.

MORE GROUP FINDER UPDATES:

 * A new option allows you to make groups only visible to friends and guildmates of people in the group.
 * When searching for groups, groups who need your role (based on your active specialization) are sorted to the top of the list.
 * You will receive a more descriptive message when you are declined when attempting to join a group that is full.

NEW FEATURES
THE BROKEN SHORE

Return to the Broken Shore and take the fight to the heart of the Legion's power on Azeroth. Begin your journey in a new Scenario, and then lead the Armies of Legionfall against the demonic invasion of Azeroth.


The dynamic ebb and flow of Broken Shore will keep you on your toes as new World Quests, bosses, treasures, and a powerful demon command ship called the Sentinax make for an exciting new experience every day.


Join a region-wide, cross-faction effort to construct buildings that open new content and provide a variety of benefits to help in the fight against the Legion.

NEW DUNGEON: THE CATHEDRAL OF ETERNAL NIGHT

The upper chambers of the Tomb of Sargeras were once a place of worship to Elune. Since the Legion's invasion, fel minions have desecrated this holy place, twisting it into their own image. Now, this site will host a battle that could turn the tide of the invasion. While the Armies of Legionfall engage the fel army directly, a small group of heroes infiltrates the upper reaches of the cathedral in a desperate hope to return the Aegis of Aggramar to its resting place. Inside this new dungeon, you'll face:


 * Agronox - This ancient served the night elves priestesses of the Temple of Elune, tending the beautiful Hanging Gardens. But after the malevolence of the Legion infected the Cathedral, the guardian absorbed fel energy through his roots. Now the twisted Agronox spreads corruption throughout the sanctuary he once protected, believing he has finally achieved his ideal state.
 * Thrashbite the Scornful - Smashspite's detestable brother, Thrashbite has been dispatched to wipe out the mortals entering the cathedral's grand library. The dimwitted mo'arg lacks any respect for knowledge or learning, feeling petty satisfaction as he crashes through ancient artifacts and tramples priceless tomes.
 * Domatrax - With the Aegis of Aggramar socketed back into its cradle, Domatrax leads an onslaught of demons to destroy the relic.
 * Mephistroth - With the forces of Azeroth pushing against his front line, Mephistroth has fallen back to the Cathedral of Eternal Night, where he will employ all his cunning to ensure the heroes fail in securing the Aegis of Agrammar.


This new dungeon is available in Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic Keystone difficulties.

CLASS CAMPAIGNS

After securing a foothold on the Broken Shore and making progress with the Armies of Legionfall, every class continues its own campaign to unify in the war effort. Your Class Hall will be the base from which you will embark on a new quest chain, find a new potential Follower, and discover new class-specific World Quests.


Once your class campaign and the Legionfall campaign on the Broken Shore are complete, all new epic class mounts will become available to those who finish the subsequent class mount quests.

DEMON ASSAULTS

The Burning Legion is preparing to assault Azeroth with renewed determination. After you regain a foothold on the Broken Shore, don't be surprised if [[Broken Isles] zones later come under attack. It will be up to you to fight to drive the Legion back and defend the lands of your new allies.

FLYING IN THE BROKEN ISLES

Take your final steps to complete the [Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two] achievement to unlock flying in the Broken Isles.

LEGION REPUTATION PROGRESS

Reputation earned beyond Exalted will now contribute towards earning additional rewards from Broken Isles faction emissaries. These new reward caches have a rare chance to reward new faction mounts, such as the [Highmountain Elderhorn], [Wild Dreamrunner], and [Leywoven Flying Carpet].

PVP BRAWLS

A series of new twists on popular player-versus-player activities are on the way. Starting with "Southshore vs Tarren Mill", "Gravity Lapse", and "Warsong Scramble", PvP Brawls offer a variety of mode, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay. Look for the Brawl option in the Group Finder (default hotkey: i) Player vs. Player tab, under the Casual selection.

PET BATTLE DUNGEON

Something nefarious is going on in the world of pet battles, and it's worth a closer look. If you have at least one level 25 battle pet, speak to Breanni in Dalaran to get directions to this new scenario.

UPDATED FEATURES
CHARACTER EMPOWERMENT

Your bond with your Artifact has grown stronger, and your Artifact Knowledge has continued to increase. Upon reaching Artifact Knowledge 25, you will receive the quest " [110] Seeking Lost Knowledge", which allows you to unlock further knowledge levels. Additionally, once you have 35 or more traits in your Artifact, the time has come to improve your Artifact even more. Unlock a set of new empowered traits, additional ranks for many of your original traits, and a new final trait by embarking on a new questline.


Your weapon isn't the only thing increasing in power. From dungeon drops to World Quest rewards to items created with your professions, your armor upgrades at higher item levels than before. All the better to fight the Legion!

    *  [Thrash] (Bear) direct damage increased by 15%.
    *  [Swipe] (Bear) damage reduced by 25%.
       * Developers' Notes: This should result in overall Guardian damage remaining roughly the same, perhaps slightly higher. But it will frontload their damage more, which should help with burst threat.
      
      
   
   

HUNTER

 * Beast Mastery
    *  [Dire Frenzy] will now additionally cause your pet to charge up to 25 yards toward the target.

       * Developers' note: Previously, casting Reap Souls at 5 stacks (which would grant 25 seconds of the buff) with 20 seconds currently left on the buff would just overwrite your old 20 second buff with a 25 second buff.

    * Souls are now reset to 0 at the start of an encounter. The buff is also canceled at the start of an encounter. Ulthalesh now has a greatly increased chance to generate the first three Tormented Souls at the beginning of a raid encounter.
       * Developers' note: Souls are a resource, and we have a rules about resetting your resources/stacks of a buff before an encounter, so that every attempt is standardized. Having souls the first time you fight a raid boss feels good, but it makes every other attempt after that feel worse by comparison.

 *  [Master of Shadows] now gains 25 Energy over 3 seconds when you enter [Stealth] or [Shadow Dance].
    * Developers' notes: Pooling energy going into a Shadow Dance has long been the way to play Subtlety, and we'd like to bring that back. This design still gives you more energy for a Shadow Dance, but in a way that allows the Rogue to fully utilize pooling gameplay.
   
   
 *  [Nightblade] now increases your damage dealt to the target by 15%, with damage over time component reduced by 35%.
    * Developers' notes: Further pushes Subtlety away from maintaining Nightblade on all secondary targets and instead into focusing their damage into 1 target. Additionally, gives Nightblade a mechanical interaction with the rest of the core rotation that fulfills the "setup" feel of Subtlety.
   
   
 *  [Premeditation] has been removed.
 *  [Relentless Strikes] now causes your finishing moves to generate 6 Energy per combo point spent.
 *  [Second Shuriken] (Artifact trait) damage increased by 200%.

NEW EVENTS IN TELDRASSIL AND LORDAERON

Beginning the week of July 24 and continuing for three weeks leading to the launch of Battle for Azeroth on August 14, experience the escalation of all-out war in Teldrassil, and later Lordaeron. A new chapter of the relentless conflict at the heart of the Warcraft saga is unfolding, and it's time for you to take your place on the front lines!

NEW CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATIONS

The war with the Burning Legion has left orcs standing tall, a new posture option available to all orc player characters. Blood Elves now have access to golden eyes, as well as a few new faces.


All of these new options are available at Barber Shops throughout Azeroth, and you can now alter your character's skin color while you're there.

PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER

The PvP Honor and Prestige system has been updated. Your PvP progress in Legion has been converted into account-wide Honor levels, which you'll continue to earn through PvP.


All class specializations' PvP Talents have been revamped. Hit default hotkey 'N' to get a look at your PvP Talents, and default hotkey 'H' to see the new PvP system.

WAR MODE IS HERE

You can now enable War Mode and venture out into a world full of others who have made the same dangerous choice. Enabling War Mode provides additional bonuses:


 * All PvP Talents you've chosen will be available to use anywhere PvP can occur.
 * You'll gain an additional bonus to experience while leveling up.
 * Earn additional bonus gold and Resources from World Quests.


War Mode can be toggled on or off beginning at level 20 by visiting either Orgrimmar or Stormwind and setting your preference in the Talent pane (default hotkey 'N'). Beware! Once you venture out in War Mode, all zones will become contested, including zones such as Northshire Abbey.


Sanctuary areas will still be PvP free.


Additional War Mode features such as Bounty Hunter and Air Drops will become available in the new zones of Battle for Azeroth.


July 17, 2018 marks the end of the final Legion season of ranked PvP, and the post-season period has begun. Look for all the new PvP progression and rewards to unlock and become earnable after the launch of Battle for Azeroth in a few weeks.


Strand of the Ancients and Ashran are no longer available.

SOCIAL FEATURES

You can now create and join cross-realm social groups in World of Warcraft. Communities make it easier for you to find and play alongside adventurers who share common interests. Hit default hotkey 'J' to get started.


Voice Chat is now available in all groups, Guilds, and Communities. Select the headset icon wherever you see it in game to talk with other players.

LEGACY LOOT MODE

Now, when you enter an instance at 10 levels or more above the maximum level of the content, Legacy Loot rules will be automatically enabled. Under Legacy Loot rules, drops will include a chance for all items that would drop for a full party or raid at the instance's level.

CLASSES

Sargeras' cruel, final blow dramatically impacted both Azeroth and all of its denizens. The power of every Artifact weapon has now been depleted. Some powers from Artifacts have now been incorporated into their specializations. Your characters that are just getting started in Legion content will still seek out and acquire Artifacts.

STATISTICS

In an effort to make displayed numbers more perceptible, values used for player and enemy statistics have been reduced throughout the game. This includes values such as item-level, damage, armor, health, and defense measurements.


A number of spells and talents now again activate a global cooldown when used.


Blood Elves' [Arcane Torrent] now removes 1 beneficial effect from all nearby enemies and restores 3% of your mana (previously silenced nearby enemies and interrupted non-player characters).

DESCRIPTION
January 22, 2019
For ages untold, Dazar'alor has stood at the center of the great and powerful Zandalari empire. Its guards have thwarted numerous attempts on King Rastakhan's life, and it has endured trials both ancient and new. But as war reaches the shores of Zuldazar, the Alliance embarks on a daring gambit to besiege the golden pyramid and sever the Zandalari's bond to the Horde.

December 10, 2018
The war raging across Azeroth between Alliance and Horde has intensified. As the Alliance lays plans to retake Darkshore and regain a foothold in Kalimdor, both factions have redoubled their attacks across the zones of Kul Tiras and Zandalar.

NEW RAID – BATTLE OF DAZAR'ALOR

The Battle of Dazar'alor is now open. The Alliance is set to stage an attack on the heart of the Zandalari empire in a bid to sever the ties of the Zandalari and the Horde, while Horde players will begin the raid by defending against an invasion in the northern jungle of Zuldazar.


Along the way, players will get to shift to the other faction's perspective and take on three additional bosses. For the first time in a raid, your character will transform into the opposite faction (including their associated racial abilities).


A dozen new, formidable boss encounters, including Lady Jaina Proudmoore and King Rastakhan himself, await you!


 * Mythic difficulty and Raid Finder Wing 1 will open with scheduled weekly maintenance in each region the week of January 29, 2019.
 * Raid Finder Wing 2 will open the week of February 12, 2019, and Raid Finder Wing 3 will open the week of February 26, 2019.

BATTLE FOR AZEROTH SEASON 2

Both the adventures and the war being waged across Azeroth are signified by seasons: times at which many factors and measurements change. Today begins Season 2 of Battle for Azeroth, and you'll find many new challenges and new rewards are now available in Dungeons and PvP content.


 * Dungeons
    * A new season of rewards from dungeons has begun. Complete your best Mythic Keystone each week to earn higher item-level gear, and save up your Titan Residuum to purchase new, powerful Azerite items.
       * Item levels of rewards from level 120 Normal, Heroic, and Mythic dungeons have been increased by 30. Baseline rewards are now item-level 340 from Normal, 355 from Heroic, and 370 from non-Keystone Mythic dungeons.
       * The difficulty of Heroic and Mythic dungeons has been increased by 30%. Normal difficulty dungeons are unchanged.
       * Mythic Keystones have been reduced by an additional 3 levels, to account for this difficulty increase.
       * Mythic Keystone rewards have been increased by 30 item levels. During the first week of Season 2, rewards from end-of-run chests will be capped at item-level 385, and the reward cache contains a Season 1 reward.
       * Beginning the second week of Season 2, the weekly cache will not be affected by the cap, and will reward Season 2 items at the higher item levels.
       * Added a new Tier 3 Mythic Keystone affix: Reaping. This bestows the power of Bwonsamdi on all non-boss creatures in the dungeon, giving them a chance to avenge their own deaths.
       * The Infested affix has been removed.
      
      
   
   


 * Player versus Player
    * Battle for Azeroth PvP Season 2 is now underway. Ranks and ratings have been reset, and you can now begin earning new rewards.
       * Season 2 rewards from PvP sources have been increased by 30 item-levels. This includes [Conquest] rewards and the weekly chest.
       * Players who earn 500 Conquest points in a given week now receive one [Quartermaster's Coin] and an item from that week's selection.
       * Players might also earn an additional piece of gear or Quartermaster's Coin each week by using a weekly bonus roll token in PvP.
       * Quartermaster's Coins can be exchanged for a Warlord's Trophy, which can be used to upgrade a piece of Sinister Gladiator gear to a higher item level.
       * During weeks when the Conquest reward is a head, shoulder, or chest item, players can choose from one of four different pieces of Azerite gear. For the weeks when the Conquest reward is not an Azerite piece, trinket, or weapon, players will be able to choose gear from one of two different slots such as legs and wrists, hands and back, or finger and feet.
       * The PvP reward UI now shows the criteria needed to receive your weekly chest. Elite sets (available to earn for a limited time only) can also be viewed in the Appearances interface on the Sets tab.
       * Players can now work toward earning the [Vicious Black Bonesteed] or [Vicious Black Warsaber]. Once earned, fill the bar again to receive a [Vicious Saddle], which can be used to purchase a mount from previous seasons.
       * The Gladiator title and achievement are can now be earned by winning 50 games in 3v3 Arenas above a 2400 rating. Players in the top 0.1% at the end of Season 2 in this bracket will earn the Sinister Gladiator title.
       * End-of-match rewards will be capped at item-level 385 during the first week of the season, to maintain parity with other endgame systems until Mythic Battle of Dazar'alor becomes available.
      
      
   
   


 * Items and Rewards Updates
    * New epic Azerite gear is now available from Season 2 PvP, the Battle of Dazar'alor raid, World Quest Emissaries, and from the Mythic Keystone vendor Thaumaturge Vashreen in Zuldazar and Boralus. These new items will have a fifth ring with additional new trait options, starting at Heart of Azeroth level 15.
    * The new ring of traits provides two choices of traits per specialization, allowing players the opportunity to find items that have traits they particularly want and the freedom to create new and interesting combinations that may not have been possible before.
    * Further changes to items and rewards include:
       * Azerite Knowledge will increase weekly from January 22 through March 26.
       * The maximum possible item level is now 425 (was 395).
       * Seals of Wartorn Fate have not been changed or reset, and will be used for Battle of Dazar'alor and other Season 2 bonus rolls.
       * Emissary weapon and armor rewards will scale up to item-level 385 (was 370).
       * Loot from Kul Tiras and Zandalar world bosses will remain at item-level 355.
       * Rewards for in-progress emissary quests may reroll or update when Season 2 begins; the quests themselves won't reset or change.
       * The [Titan Residuum] vendor now offers item-level 385, 400, and 415 gear.
       * Titan Residuum is not reset or capped between seasons.
       * Warfronts
          * Darkshore Warfront rewards have been increased by 15 item levels, and the outdoor world boss and the once-per-cycle quest now award item-level 400 gear.
          * The power of all enemies in the Darkshore Warfront have been increased by 15%, and the item level required to queue for Darkshore is now 335 (was 320).
             * Developers' notes: These Darkshore changes will take effect after the current Warfront cycle has ended. If an attack is already underway in your region, the Warfront will give Season 1 rewards until the attack phase ends. This is being done to avoid any unfairness to people who had already completed the Warfront or killed the world boss before the start of the new season.
            
            
          * Rewards from Arathi Basin and Stromgarde Warfront have not changed.

Look for new Missions to upgrade your faction's outposts, level up followers so that they gain access to a new equipment slot, send your followers on lucrative new weekly treasure hunts, and unlock a vendor who offers the opposing faction's pets.
   
   
 * Faction Assaults
    * Periodically, the Alliance or the Horde will launch an assault against a hostile position in Kul Tiras or Zandalar. When an Assault is active, a group of new World Quests will be available to both factions in that area. Rally to the location to fight on behalf of your faction and earn new Honorbound or 7th Legion Service Medals that can be exchanged for a variety of rewards.
    * Players who have unlocked World Quests at level 120 on at least one character will have Assault World Quests available to any of their other characters.
   
   

WARFRONT: THE BATTLE FOR DARKSHORE

 * The conflict over the home of the night elves has reached a fever pitch, and new questlines will lead you to the all-new Battle for Darkshore. In this new Warfront, you'll unlock access to powerful hero transformations that give you temporary abilities themed around your role as a tank, healer, or damage dealer.
    * Contributions for Darkshore as well as the Stromgarde Warfront now operate on a daily cycle. When resources are being mustered, three quartermasters will each put out a request for a different contribution each day. The requested turn-ins have also been adjusted to be more consistent in their value.
    * When your faction controls either Arathi Highlands or Darkshore, world quests will now be available in those zones, in place of the once-per-cycle kill quests that were previously offered for Arathi.

    * The chance for cosmetic rewards are now based on all the enemies and Azerite present on the island, and no longer tied to only the enemy camps your team defeats. Completing an Island Expedition at a higher difficulty increases the chance of receiving these bonus rewards.

    * The weekly quest to recover Azerite now requires 36,000 Azerite (was 40,000).

 * Hunter
    *  [Tar Trap] will now break an enemy player out of stealth if they are the one to activate the trap.
   
   
 * Priest
    * Discipline

 * Warlock
    * Destruction
       *  [Demon Armor] now increases Armor by 150% (was 275%).
          * During Battle for Azeroth Season 1, we identified that Warlocks were taking too much damage from physical sources during PvP. We remedied this by adding a new PvP talent, Demon Armor, which increased their physical mitigation to match characters wearing Plate Armor. As we've been monitoring Season 2, we feel that the armor increase caused Warlocks to become too tanky in the current meta. This change effectively brings their physical mitigation close to that of Mail Armor (about 36% at ilvl 415), when it was previously similar to Plate Armor (about 45% at ilvl 415).

NEW ZONE: NAZJATAR

During a high-stakes chase across the seas, the Alliance and the Horde are waylaid by an ancient enemy who's been lurking beneath the depths: Queen Azshara and her fearsome naga army. The naval forces of both factions are destroyed in the ambush, and the survivors find themselves stranded in the ancient naga domain of Nazjatar.


Soon after they arrive in Nazjatar, Alliance heroes will come upon a new faction of deep-sea warriors, the Waveblade Ankoan, while Horde heroes will meet the Unshackled, a group of races who have escaped the naga's clutches. Both sides offer champions who offer their services as combat allies and grow in power over time as players prepare for their epic confrontation with Queen Azshara.


Adventurers who are level 120 and have unlocked Battle for Azeroth World Quests, completing the quest " [120] Uniting Kul Tiras" or " [120] Uniting Zandalar," will receive a summon from either Genn Greymane or Nathanos Blightcaller, kicking off the events that bring them to Nazjatar.

BENTHIC GEAR

Increase your power with Benthic gear, new upgradable armor that can now be collected in Nazjatar. As you explore Nazjatar, you'll collect Prismatic Manapearls—a soulbound currency that can be spent on Benthic tokens and upgrades. These bind-to-account tokens can be used to gain a piece of upgradable Benthic gear specific to your armor type (cloth, leather, mail, plate), starting at item level 385. With enough time and effort, players can dedicate their hard-earned Manapearls to upgrade pieces to ilvl 425, just shy of Heroic-level raid gear (ilvl 430). Harnessing the power of the sea, each piece of Benthic gear boasts a thematic bonus that activates in Nazjatar and the upcoming Azshara's Eternal Palace raid. These bonuses might provide effects that boost your damage, slow down your foes, or even increase your mount speed while adventuring through this perilous region. Put together pieces to create a powerful set for combat, collect a set optimized for exploration, or mix and match to have the best from both worlds.

PRISMATIC MANAPEARLS

Defeating powerful enemies, completing quests, and plundering the treasures of Azshara's minions may yield Prismatic Manapearls, concentrations of magical energy highly prized by Nazjatar's denizens. Spend this new currency on many different items within Nazjatar including Benthic tokens and upgrades for Benthic gear, pets, and a mount. Earn Prismatic Manapearls by completing a variety of activities such as World Quests and daily quests, looting treasure chests, and slaying rare enemies.

NEW ZONE: MECHAGON ISLAND

Legends speak of a place off the craggy coast of Kul Tiras whose denizens have replaced blood and bones with bolts and brass: Mechagon, home of a society of mechanically augmented gnomes and their iron-fisted ruler King Mechagon. Heroes who arrive upon Mechagon's shores will soon meet Prince Erazmin and the Rustbolt Resistance, and after completing a series of new faction-based quests, they'll join their fight to overthrow Erazmin's tyrannical father and put an end to his mad designs.


Players can rise in power and earn the trust of their new allies by participating in new daily quests and other activities unique to Mechagon. These include collaborative Construction Projects that allow players to contribute resources to create a variety of powerful constructs, including experimental weapons, flame turrets, a drill rig that can uncover a cave full of treasures, and more.


After establishing a hub in Nazjatar and empowering their [Heart of Azeroth], players will make their way to Mechagon by starting the quest " [120] The Legend of Mechagon," which can be accepted by Alliance players in Boralus and Horde players in Dazar'alor near each city's respective Flight Masters.

JUNKYARD TINKERING

As they traverse the zone, players will have access to Pascal-K1N6, a giant iron robot who will help players craft equipment, mounts, toys, consumables, and more in exchange for Spare Parts and Energy Cells found across Mechagon. Recipes to craft more items can be found around the island.

POCKET-SIZED COMPUTATION DEVICE

The [Pocket-Sized Computation Device] is a trinket that players can customize via three Punchcard Sockets, into which players can insert one Red, Yellow, and Blue Punch Card. Punch Cards can be collected by questing, exploring the Mechagon zone, and advancing through the new Mythic-only dungeon Operation: Mechagon. Players will receive their Pocket-Sized Computation Device after completing the " [120] Upgraded" quest, available shortly after landing in Mechagon.

NEW RAID: AZSHARA'S ETERNAL PALACE

Battle against Nazjatar's worthiest champions, face down unfathomable monstrosities from the deep, and confront the legendary Queen Azshara herself in this sprawling 8-boss raid.


Learn more about the bosses guarding Azshara's Eternal Palace here.


Azshara's Eternal Palace Normal and Heroic difficulties will open on July 9, two weeks after Rise of Azshara goes live on June 25. Raid Finder Wing One and Mythic will open the following week on July 16.

NEW DUNGEON: OPERATION: MECHAGON

Level 120 players will unite with Prince Erazmin and the Rustbolt Resistance to help overthrow his deranged father and destroy his Mechoriginator doomsday device in this new 8-boss "mega-dungeon." This Mythic-only instance will be open to players after they complete new faction-based quests for the Rustbolt Resistance. Great rewards await you in Mechagon, but bear in mind that gnome-crafted loot might have some surprising properties...


Operation: Mechagon will open to players at the start of Season 3, July 9, after accepting the quest "Operation: Mechagon – The Mechoriginator."

HEART OF AZEROTH SYSTEM UPDATE: ESSENCES

Infuse the might of the Titans into your [Heart of Azeroth] with Essences. These powerful active and passive abilities allow you to customize your playstyle in a whole new way. Each Essence possesses a Major Power (usually a new active ability) and a Minor Power (which is always passive). The Heart of Azeroth has slots for one Major and two Minor Essences. Place an Essence in the Major slot to activate both its Major and Minor Powers, and place up to two in the Minor slots to activate their Minor Powers. Adapt to conquer any situation by applying or swapping them out within rest areas, cities, or when using items such as the Tome of Quiet Mind.


Grow in power each time you unlock one of four ranks for your Essence. At Rank 1, an Essence's Major and Minor effects are available, while Rank 2 and Rank 3 enhance those Major and Minor effects. Rank 4 adds a flashier cosmetic effect to an Essence's Major Power, providing a distinctive appearance that will make its wielder stand out from the crowd. Earn Essences by completing specific activities, including PvP, raiding, or engaging in World Quests. Some Essences are specific to a role (damage dealer, tank, or healer), and some are usable by any role. After acquiring an Essence, you'll be able to hover your mouse over the Essence in the user interface to see information about the next rank and how to acquire it.


Players will need to complete a new quest line to unlock the Heart Forge before infusing Essences into the Heart of Azeroth. This will unlock the Major slot, and will reward them with their first Essence. The two Minor slots will unlock at Heart of Azeroth levels 55 and 65 respectively. Players with a Heart of Azeroth below level 35 will have it raised to level 35 upon unlocking the Heart Forge.


Level 120 players who have established their new hub in Nazjatar will be invited to join Magni at the Chamber of Heart in Silithus to start the new quest line to unlock the Heart Forge, beginning with the quest " [120] Essential Empowerment."

MOUNT EQUIPMENT

Have you ever wished that your favorite mount could carry you across the water without sinking? Give most of your mounts more speed, daze prevention, a parachute, or water walking with mount equipment! Upon reaching level 100 on one character, a new mount equipment slot will become available in the Mounts interface on all characters. Mount equipment can be crafted by Enchanters, Tailors, and Leatherworkers and can be listed in the Auction House or purchased directly from the artisans themselves. Players that already have Water Strider mounts should check their mailbox for one free piece of water-walking mount equipment.


Note that mounts do not benefit from mount equipment in battlegrounds or Arenas and that some do not benefit from mount equipment at all such as the [Sky Golem].

NEW QUESTS

A host of new stories and adventures are now available across Azeroth.

MAGNI BRONZEBEARD

Mysterious magics have awakened across Azeroth. Among them are the essences of the five dragonflights, which Magni Bronzebeard suspects can unlock the full potential of the Heart of Azeroth. Level 120 players should heed Magni's call to continue the story and earn their first Essence, which grants a new, powerful ability tailored to their character's role (damage dealer, healer, or tank) or all roles.

WAR CAMPAIGN: STAY OF EXECUTION

Upon learning of Sylvanas's plans to execute Baine Bloodhoof for treason, the Alliance and the Horde send strike teams to infiltrate the Kor'kron Barracks and rescue the noble tauren chieftain—meeting up with an old orcish ally along the way.


The latest episode of the War Campaign is available to level 120 players who have completed the previous chapters and finished the quest "Clearing out the Cache." Speak to Lady Jaina Proudmoore or Lor'themar in Nazjatar to begin this perilous mission.

NEW HERITAGE ARMOR: GNOMES AND TAUREN

Delve deeper into the lore of the gnomes and the tauren and unlock Heritage Armor that reflects their legacies. Level 120 tauren or gnome players who are Exalted with their faction (Gnomeregan or Thunder Bluff respectively) will be able to embark on a quest line that explores their race's history. Once completed, players will gain a new Heritage Armor transmogrification set usable by all their characters of the same race.


Eligible gnomes and tauren can begin the quest by speaking with their race's ambassador in their faction's Embassy in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. Those seeking the tauren Heritage Armor will additionally to be tasked with freeing Baine in the War Campaign quest " [120] Stay of Execution" (on any character on their account) before beginning their quest line.

NEW EPIC BATTLEGROUND: ASHRAN

Once home to a mighty ogre empire, the ruins of Ashran hold ancient artifacts infused with great power that could turn the tide of war. Return to Draenor and fight on familiar turf in a brand-new 40v40 Epic Battleground: Ashran.


Starting at level 100, players can clash with the enemy faction on the main road of Ashran, carving a warpath into the enemy's stronghold. After either slaying 700 enemy reinforcements or successfully invading the stronghold, players will come together to bring down the enemy faction leader—the Alliance's Grand Marshal Tremblade or the Horde's High Warlord Volrath. Collect Ancient Artifacts, Artifact Fragments, Class Spellbooks, and other items to improve your chances of victory. Gathering Artifact Fragments from fallen foes will allow you to summon elite allies, Fangraal and Kronus, to lead your faction's charge into battle.


Players will find and be able to queue for Ashran in the Epic Battleground section of the Group Finder (default hotkey: i).

NEW ISLAND EXPEDITIONS

Set sail and discover two new Islands: Crestfall and Snowblossom Village. New loot including armor, weapons, and pets awaits players, but beware: you're not alone. Faction rivals will want to hoard the spoils for themselves. Take them down!

NEW MISSIONS AND MECHANICS
NEW MISSIONS AND TROOPS

As you take the fight to the seas, your loyal followers will be with you every step of the way. You can now enlist Boat Captains and other skilled seafarers to fight your battles.

EVENT AND HOLIDAY MISSIONS

Send out your followers to embark on new holiday- and event-themed missions. Spoils will include special currencies to spend during holidays and events, including Brewfest and Timewalking, along with rewards that are only available during those periods.

FLYING IN KUL TIRAS AND ZANDALAR

The once-forbidden skies of Kul Tiras and Zandalar will soon be open to heroes eager to take flight. The achievement [Battle for Azeroth Pathfinder, Part Two] will allow daring adventurers to take to the skies in Battle for Azeroth's zones, including in the new ones, Mechagon and Nazjatar. Hardy adventurers will need to earn Revered reputation with the Rustbolt Resistance and with their new Nazjatar allies (The Waveblade Ankoan or The Unshackled), explore Mechagon and Nazjatar, and complete the first part of the meta-achievement, [Battle for Azeroth Pathfinder, Part One].


Adventurers who complete these requirements and unlock flying will also be rewarded with a mechanical parrot mount: Wonderwing 2.0.

MOUNTS

Ride through Nazjatar and Mechagon in style as you collect several new aquatic- and mechanical-inspired mounts. Six of them are listed below, but there are even more waiting to be discovered!

AZSHARI BLOATRAY

Raised in captivity, these yellow aquatic creatures' gas organs are harvested by the naga to allow them to breathe air more easily. Players will rescue one to use as their personal mount after earning the achievement Glory of the Palace Raider.

 [CRIMSON TIDESTALLION]

These blood-red, spirited creatures gracefully flit through the water, carrying heroes swiftly through the sea. Crimson Tidestallions can be purchased from Murloc Trader Mrrl in Nazjatar in exchange for several eclectic items after completing the quest "A Safer Place."

ROYAL SNAPDRAGON

Fierce and loyal companions, blue Royal Snapdragons are snatched from the wild at a young age and raised to serve naga hunters. Claim your own by vanquishing high-ranking naga in Nazjatar.

X-995 MECHANOCAT

Crafted through Junkyard Tinkering, these robotic cats can be painted a variety of colors, which players can collect during their adventures in Mechagon.

 [SCRAPFORGED MECHASPIDER]

Planet-conscious players who complete the quests given by Recycler Kerchunk in Rustbolt will be rewarded with this mount.

MECHACYCLE MODEL W

This mechanical marvel is the pinnacle of supercharged street performance in mechagnome travel. Boasting the best in aerodynamic performance, this gorgeous wheel will be gifted to players who complete the achievement Mecha-Done.

PET BATTLES

A new challenge awaits your army of fierce little companions in Rise of Azshara.

PET BATTLE DUNGEON: STRATHOLME

It's time to marshal your menagerie and put your best battle pets forward within the halls of Stratholme, a new Pet Battle Dungeon with Normal and Challenge difficulties. Those who prove themselves to be the very best will earn an Ultimate Battle-Training Stone after defeating the dungeon on Normal difficulty.

BRAWLER'S GUILD

 * The Strange Thing encounter is now easier to defeat.

CLASSES

 * Death Knight
    * Frost
       *  [Runic Empowerment] has a 2% chance to proc per Runic Power spent (was 1.5%).
       *  [Icecap] now reduces [Pillar of Frost] cooldown by 2 seconds (was 1 second).
       *  [Frost Fever]'s chance to generate Runic Power increased to 30%.
          * Chance now diminishes on targets beyond the first.
         
         
       *  [Frost Strike] damage increased by 15%.
       *  [Breath of Sindragosa] damage reduced by 10%.
       * Breath of Sindragosa now generates 2 Runes when cast, and another 2 when the effect expires.
       * Breath of Sindragosa costs 16 Runic Power per second (up from 15).
          * Developers' notes: Frost was starved of resources too often, especially when using Breath of Sindragosa. This increases Frosts' Rune income baseline and includes a further change that returns many extra Runes while using Breath of Sindragosa. Breath builds will now be able to fill more global cooldowns with casts of [Obliterate] to make up for the lost Frost Strikes. The cost of Breath itself is increased to keep its overall duration roughly unchanged.
         
         
      
      
    * Unholy
       *  [Festering Strike], [Scourge Strike], [Festering Wound], [Death Coil], and [Clawing Shadows] damage increased by 15%.
       *  [Army of the Dead]'s Ghoul damage increased by 6%.
          * Developers' notes: Previously, a bug allowed Army of the Dead Ghouls' Energy to benefit doubly from Haste. To compensate for the effects of the bug fix, we've increased their damage to keep it consistent.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Demon Hunter
    * Havoc
       *  [Mastery: Demonic Presence] damage bonus increased by 20%.
       *  [Chaos Strike] and Trail of Ruin damage reduced by 4%.
          * Developer's notes: Previously Mastery was relatively weak when compared to other secondary stats. By increasing Mastery's effect for Havoc, it should now be a more desirable stat on gear. To balance this upcoming power increase, we've slightly reduced the damage output of Chaos Strike and Trial of Ruin.
         
         
      
      
    * Vengeance
       *  [Demonic Wards] damage reduction increased to 15% (was 10%).
       * Demonic Wards armor bonus increased to 100% (was 80%).
       *  [Demon Spikes] armor reduced to 60% of Agility (was 85%).
       *  [Soul Cleave] damage increased by 40%.
          * Developers' notes: More so than other tanks, Vengeance Demon Hunters are currently dealing with the problem of low mitigation when their active mitigation is down. These changes provide a substantial increase to physical mitigation when Demon Spikes is down, and a neutral-to-very-slight increase when Demon Spikes is active. The changes also provide some overall passive reduction to magic damage. Overall, the amount of sustained damage Vengeance takes will be lower, and the periods of vulnerability outside of Demon Spikes should be less dramatic.
         
         
      
      
    * Metamorphosis
       * Health bonus is now 50% (was 30%).
       *  [Shear] now generates 20 additional Pain and 1 additional Lesser Soul Fragment (was: generates 7 Pain per second).
          * Developers' notes: This significantly increases the health bonus, damage mitigation, and self-healing potential of Metamorphosis, as well as the health buffer, making it a more reliable major cooldown against all types of damage.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Druid
    *  [Soothe], [Remove Corruption], [Moonfire], and [Rebirth] are no longer castable in Cat or [Bear Form] by default.
    * Feral Druids now have a passive ability learned at level 22 that allows Remove Corruption and Soothe to be cast in Cat Form.
    * Guardian Druids now have a passive ability learned at level 10 that allows Soothe, Remove Corruption, Moonfire, and Rebirth to be cast in Bear Form.
       * Developers' notes: Guardian Druid is limited in its practical ability to use some utility abilities while tanking, and we're loosening that restriction by allowing Remove Corruption in Bear Form. We're also cleaning up Druid shapeshifting rules slightly: the use of magical-themed spells in beast forms is allowed by passive upgrades given to Guardian and Feral specializations specifically. This represents their special mastery of their "home" form that allows for limited spellcasting, and from a gameplay perspective, this allows Feral and Guardian Druids to use spells in-form when there is a strong practical need. At the same time, in situations where there is no fantasy justification or gameplay need, it makes sense for spellcasting to be more restricted. For example, non–Guardian Druids can no longer cast Moonfire in Bear Form.
      
      
    * Guardian
       *  [Ironfur] now has a maximum of 8 stacks.
       * Ironfur and [Maul] now cost 40 Rage (was 45).
       *  [Mangle] now generates 10 Rage (was 8).
          * Developers' notes: Ironfur is intended to be maintainable with high uptime (up to 100%) and have some overlaps on top of that. Currently, depending on talent configuration, Druids may only be able to barely maintain full uptime on Ironfur. Making Ironfur much more available should allow better control over timing and overlaps, as well as improving Guardian mitigation overall.
         
         
       * Shifting to [Bear Form] now gives 25 Rage (was 20).
          * Developers' notes: It should now be much easier to get the first Ironfur activated promptly after engaging an enemy, due to the increased starting Rage and lower cost.
         
         
       * Mangle and [Thrash] direct damage increased by 15%.
       *  [Frenzied Regeneration] (Rank 3) is learned at level 85.
       * Frenzied Regeneration's healing has been increased by 33%.
      
      
    * Restoration
       * Casting [Overgrowth] while [Soul of the Forest] is active will now increase the healing of Overgrowth's [Rejuvenation], instead of its [Regrowth] heal over time effect.
      
      
   
   
 * Hunter
    * Horridon is now tamable by Hunters of any specialization.
    * Beast Mastery
       * Barbed Shot damage is now affected by [Bestial Wrath].
       * Barbed Shot damage reduced by 10%.
       * Oondasta is now tamable by Beast Mastery Hunters.
          * Developers' notes: We are fixing a bug that caused Bestial Wrath to not affect Barbed Shot damage, and lowering the base damage of Barbed Shot to keep overall damage roughly unchanged.
         
         
      
      
    * Survival
       * Mastery: Spirit Bond damage bonus increased by 20%.
          * Developers' notes: Previously Mastery was relatively weak when compared to other secondary stats. By increasing the power of Mastery's effect for Survival, it should now be a more desirable stat on gear.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Mage
    * Frost
       *  [Mastery: Icicles] damage bonus increased by 15%.
       *  [Glacial Spike] base damage reduced by 7%.
          * Developers' notes: Previously Mastery was relatively weak when compared to other secondary stats. By increasing Mastery's effect for Frost, it should now be a more desirable stat on gear. To balance this upcoming power increase, we've slightly reduced the damage output of Glacial Spike.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Priest
    * Shadow
       *  [Auspicious Spirits] now increases Shadowy Apparition damage by 50%.
       *  [Shadow Word: Pain] damage reduced by 9%.
       *  [Vampiric Touch] damage reduced by 9%.
          * We believe damage-over-time specializations that maintain a variety of DoT spells should in general output more damage in encounters with multiple targets than single-target oriented specializations. In addition to measuring class specializations against others, we must also balance them across the entire spectrum of content. Due to the types of encounters in Tides of Vengeance, Shadow Priests were especially strong in some contexts and correspondingly weak in very few situations when compared to similar DoT specializations. As such, we're slightly pulling back on the abilities that proc Shadowy Apparition, which is the prominent contributor of making Shadow Priests significantly stronger than similar counterparts.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Rogue
    * Outlaw
       * Keep Your Wits About You (Azerite Trait) now stacks once per instance of [Blade Flurry] dealing damage (was once for every target Blade Flurry hits). Each stack now provides 5% [Sinister Strike] chance (was 2%).
          * Developers' notes: In very large packs of enemies, especially in dungeons, Keep Your Wits About You provides much more damage than one copy of one Azerite Trait was intended to provide. With this change, you'll still feel this trait accelerate as you build stacks, but the size of the group that you're fighting won't affect how much damage the trait is giving you. This will be a damage increase against two targets, and a damage reduction against 3 or more targets.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Shaman
    * Enhancement
       * The Molten Weapon buff from the Elemental Spirits talent now only modifies the Fire damage of your class abilities, instead of modifying all Fire damage dealt.
          * Developers' notes: With the addition of the new Azerite Essences in the Rise of Azshara content update, many of which deal Fire damage, we did not want to make this talent feel mandatory. Prior to this change, the Molten Weapon buff from the fiery Spirit Wolf would have increased the damage dealt by several Azerite Essences. The buff effects from Elemental Spirits talent are intended to increase your class abilities, and still will after this change.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Warrior
    * Arms
       *  [Execute], [Mortal Strike], [Rend], and [Slam] damage increased by 6%.
       *  [Mastery: Deep Wounds] damage bonus increased by 12%.
          * Developers' notes: Previously Mastery was relatively weak when compared to other secondary stats. By increasing the power of Mastery's effect for Arms, it should now be a more desirable stat on gear.
         
         
      
      
    * Protection
       * Unstoppable Force [Thunder Clap] damage reduced to 30% (was 100%).
          * Developers' notes: Protection Warrior burst DPS with Avatar is extremely high for a tank. This talent was adding more damage than necessary, given that it also decreases Thunder Clap's cooldown and synergizes well with certain Azerite traits.
         
         
      
      
   
   

DUNGEONS AND RAIDS
ARTIFACT POWER

Several Mythic Keystone dungeons now award different amounts of Artifact Power based on their length.

    * Reduced dungeon completion timer to 33 minutes (was 36 minutes).
   
   
 * King's Rest
    * Enemy Forces requirements increased by 10%.
    * Increased the Enemy Forces contribution of Animated Guardian.

    * Increased the Enemy Forces contribution granted by eliminating several non-boss enemies (Deepsea Ritualist, Windspeaker Heldis, Runecarver Skorn, Guardian Elemental, Living Current, Abyssal Eel).
   
   
 * Tol Dagor
    * Enemy Forces requirements increased by 15%.
    * Heavy Cannons now start with 100 Energy and Canon Blast costs 20 energy.

    * Enemy Forces requirements increased by 5%.

    * The number of Felfire Munitions required to defeat the encounter has been reduced to 5 for characters with a level of 104 or greater on all raid difficulties.
   
   

ISLAND EXPEDITIONS UPDATES

 * Some powerful consumable items such as the Demolisher and Siege Engine have returned to PvP Island Expeditions. These items can now be collected, repaired, and fought over throughout the island.
 * The rotating Seafarer's Dubloon vendors who previously sold these consumables now have new items to offer.

ITEMS AND REWARDS

 * Artifact Power
    * Azerite values have been adjusted to allow players to get more of their total Artifact Power from the below sources.
       * Dungeons
          * Mythic Keystone Dungeon Weekly Cache now rewards 3800 AP (was 1900).
         
         
       * Island Expeditions
          * Heroic Island End-of-match now rewards 300 AP (was 225 AP).
          * Mythic and PvP Island End-of-match now rewards 450 AP (was 350 AP).
          * Island Weekly Quest now rewards 3500 AP (was 2500 AP).
         
         
       * Player versus Player

          * 2v2 Arena now rewards 240 AP (was 120 AP).
          * 3v3 Arena now rewards 300 AP (was 150 AP).
          * Unrated Battlegrounds now rewards 300 AP (was 150 AP).
          * Epic Battlegrounds now rewards 600 AP (was 300 AP).
          * Rated Battlegrounds now rewards 1050 AP (was 525 AP).
          * Against Overwhelming Odds now rewards 2000 AP (was 1000 AP).
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Gear Scaling
    * Most item effects that deal damage or healing now scale based off of a character's secondary stat (was primary stat).
       * Developers' note: We made some under-the-hood changes to how item effects that deal damage, healing, and shielding scale with item level. The net effect of these changes is that almost all items like this in Battle for Azeroth are now moderately stronger. The difference is greater the higher the item level of the item. This includes items from Battle for Azeroth dungeons, raids, and PvP rewards.
      
      
   
   
 * Heart of Azeroth
    * The Personal Absorb-O-Tron Azerite Trait will now absorb 50% of damage taken over 20 seconds (was 100%). The total amount of damage absorbed by this trait remains unchanged.
    * Paladin
       * Holy
          * Developers' note: This build has gotten far enough ahead of other Holy Paladin options, as well as other healers in some cases, that we're paring it back while leaving the gameplay generally unchanged.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Players in Nazjatar can now ride underwater mounts on land with Budding Deepcoral.
 * A Tiny Clockwork Key allows Pepe to sometimes dress up as mechanical bird.
 * Some heirlooms have been renamed to be more faction-specific.
    * Bolstering War Horn has been renamed to Dwarven War Horn (Alliance) and Orcish War Horn (Horde).
    * Bolstering War Horn has been renamed to Dwarven War Horn (Alliance) and Orcish War Horn (Horde).
    * Cloak of Hardened Steel has been renamed to Banded Gilnean Cloak (Alliance) and Stone Guard's Bladed Cloak (Horde).
    * Dusk Powder has been renamed to Kaldorei Powder of Twilight (Alliance) and Deathstalker's Gloaming Powder (Horde).
    * Enchanted Scroll has been renamed to Tidesage's Warscroll (Alliance) and Loa-Touched Warscroll (Horde).
   
   

LEVELING

 * Players who manually group with a player that has turned off experience gains will now receive 95% less experience.
    * Developers' note: This change does not impact players who find themselves automatically grouped by matchmaking for activities like Group Finder dungeons or Island Expeditions.
   
   

PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER

 * Arena
    * Tiger's Peak has finished repairs and is once again available as an Arena map.
    * Team colors have been changed from gold and green to gold and purple.
   
   
 * Battlegrounds
    * Alterac Valley
       * UI now tracks progress for summoning Lokholar the Ice Lord and Ivus the Forest Lord.
       * Two seasonal quests have been added to Alterac Valley. These quests, similar to the ones offered in Wintergrasp, will reset and are repeatable each season.
      
      
    * Seething Shore
       * When the battleground begins, the same three nodes will always be in the first wave (Ridge, Ruins, and Tar Pits).
       * Players who use the jetpack's Thrust ability while airborne now travel further.
      
      
   
   
 * Enlistment Bonus
    * Now rewards 50% more Azerite Power for participating in Random Battlegrounds and Epic Battlegrounds.
       * Developers' note: Battleground queue times become exceedingly long when one faction has more people queuing than the other. When queue times exceed a certain threshold, Mercenary Mode becomes available for the faction with long queue times and the Enlistment Bonus becomes available for the less represented faction. Now, the Enlistment Bonus will increase the amount of Azerite Power from Random Battlegrounds and Random Epic Battlegrounds by 50%.
      
      
   
   
 * Items
    * Void Stone's absorption ability has been reduced by 30% for healers and 60% for non-healers in PvP.
    * Diamond-Laced Refracting Prism personal absorption shield has been reduced by 30% for tank specializations and 60% for non-tank specializations in PvP.
    * Abyssal Speaker's Gauntlets absorption shield is now reduced by 80% in PvP (was 66%).
    * Trident of the Deep Ocean absorption shield is now reduced by 75% in PvP (was 50%).
    * Mindthief's Eldritch Clasp healing and self-damage effect is now reduced by 50% in PvP.
       * Developers' note: Several Crucible of Storms raid items had a significant impact on the PvP meta in Season 2. We believe that raid items in PvP can be a meaningful source of gameplay variety that contribute to each season feeling a bit different than ones before it. Due to the nature of our PvP scaling system, which helps make PvP more accessible for more players, means the effects of these items will remain relevant longer than we'd like. Therefore, we're reducing the effectiveness of these items in the new patch so players can feel good about transitioning to new items they acquire in Season 3.
      
      
    * Horde and Alliance Glider Kits now have a prideful new look.
    * All racial abilities that share a cooldown with Honorable Medallion now only display corresponding information when the talent is selected.
   
   
 * Death Knight
    * Frost
       * Chill Streak no longer deals damage based on the target's (or caster's) maximum health.
       * Chill Streak now deals an additional percent of Attack Power per bounce to applicable targets (up to 9%).
       * Chill Streak no longer adheres to the maximum health percentage PvP talent restrictions.
       * Chill Streak can now critical strike, scale with your increased damage modifications (e.g. Mastery), and benefit from damage taken debuffs applied on the target.
          * Developers' note: We're changing Chill Streak from damage based on the target's maximum health to one based on the Death Knight's attack power. This has the effect of dealing damage more equally against targets of any health range.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Druid
    * Restoration
       * Casting Overgrowth while Soul of the Forest is active will now increase the healing of Overgrowth's Rejuvenation, instead of its Regrowth heal over time effect.
          * Developers' notes: Overgrowth applies both Rejuvenation and Regrowth's heal over time effect, but Soul of the Forest will only effect one of them. We're adjust the interaction of these two spells to more accurately match players expectations of their synergy.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Monk
    * Brewmaster
       * Hot Trub now splits its damage among all enemies hit.
      
      
   
   
 * Paladin
    * Protection
       * Unbound Freedom now grants its caster Blessing of Freedom when cast on a different target.
       * Unbound Freedom now prevents Blessing of Freedom from being dispelled when cast on the same target.
          * Developers' note: Unbound Freedom is an underperforming talent that leans into a Paladin's core strength of enabling their allies. By applying the benefit of Blessing of Freedom to the casting Paladin as well as their teammate, the spell becomes a powerful tool against enemy teams that rely on movement-impairing effects and control.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Retribution
    * Unbound Freedom now grants the Paladin Blessing of Freedom when it is cast on another target.
    * Unbound Freedom now prevents Blessing of Freedom from being dispelled when cast on the same target.
       * Developers' note: Unbound Freedom is an underperforming talent that leans into a Paladin's core strength of enabling their allies. By applying the benefit of Blessing of Freedom to the casting Paladin as well as their teammate, the spell becomes a powerful tool against enemy teams that rely on movement-impairing effects and control.
      
      
   
   
 * Priest
    * Discipline
       * Mana regeneration is now reduced by 40% in PvP (was 45%).
       * Dome of Light reduces the cooldown of Power Word: Barrier by 90 seconds (was 60 seconds).
       * Dome of Light reduces damage taken by an additional 25% (was 45%).
       * Premonition now heals up to four friendly targets with your Atonement active (was all nearby friendly targets).
       * Premonition's heal radius increased to 40 yards (was 30 yards).
       * Premonition now heals for 55% spell power (was 75% spell power).
       * Premonition now damages you for 35% spell power (was 46% spell power).
       * Premonition increases the duration of your Atonements on targets healed by 3 seconds.
       * Trinity now increases the healing transfer of atonement by 20% (was 12%).
       * Ultimate Radiance increases the healing of Power Word: Radiance by 250% (was 200%).
          * Developers' notes: In Season 2, we increased the importance of healer mana management in Arenas and Battlegrounds by reducing mana regeneration in PvP instances. Due to Discipline's healing style, the spec tends to run out of mana much faster in Arena compared to other specs. So, we're buffing their mana regeneration in PvP and adjusting some of their PvP talents to increase their throughput. In addition, we're adjusting Dome of Light to allow it to be used more frequently but with less damage reduction to give them an additional tool to recover after crowd control.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * Shaman
    * Elemental
       * Lightning Lasso now deals 140% spell power per tick (was 8% of the target's maximum health).
       * Lightning Lasso now deals damage to permanently stun immune mobs.
      
      
   
   
 * Warlock
    * Affliction
       * Endless Affliction no longer increases the duration of Unstable Affliction.
       * Endless Affliction now leaves a 10 second debuff on the target after the final Unstable Affliction runs its full duration.
       * Dispelling Endless Affliction will silence, damage, and increase damage taken by 10% to the target while active.
       * Casting Unstable Affliction on a target that has Endless Affliction active will remove it.
       * A new aura icon will indicate to healers that a target has Endless Affliction or Unstable Affliction active.
          * Developers' note: Our intention with the Endless Affliction talent is to allow the Warlock to opt into longer dispel protection for their team's damage over time spells and other debuffs. The previous version of this came at a cost of slowing down the rate at which they deal damage. We've broken the additional dispel protection off into its own debuff so that this talent doesn't change the warlocks damage profile.
         
         
      
      
   
   
 * UI
    * The end-of-match scoreboard for Arenas and Battlegrounds now has a new look and provides more information about player rewards.
