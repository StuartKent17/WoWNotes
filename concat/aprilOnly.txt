NEW DUNGEON VISITATION LIMITATION SYSTEM

With the many improvements to end-game dungeons implemented last patch, we decided that it was necessary to limit the number of times a player can enter a dungeon per day. This was done to prevent the economy from being flooded with overly valuable items, and to ensure that players weren't acquiring too much gold during what we'd consider a reasonable amount of play-time. We realize that many players enjoy repeated trips to their favorite dungeons, so we've made this new limitation as least restrictive as possible. Each character on a player's account may enter the same dungeon up to three times per day, and may visit a total of five dungeons over the course of a twenty-four hour period. Keep in mind, each character on your account is flagged separately so with eight characters, that's a total of 40 dungeon-runs per day!

FLIGHTPATH SCENERY IMPROVEMENTS!

Tired of seeing the same old flightpaths? We've completely reworked each flightpath in the game so that the angle and view are shifted just enough to give all of Azeroth's traveling inhabitants the feeling that they are headed to an all new destination. That's not all, each flightpath has been fleshed out to ensure that the player sees every single detail of the passing terrain, which means that for the same reasonable traveling cost, you'll purchase a ride that's twice the length, and in some cases three and even four times as long!

GENERAL

 * Number keys can no longer activate character abilities. In many cases, this gave certain players a slight advantage over those that used their mouse to activate their abilities.
 * Black Tabby now called Little Cat.
 * Jumping while mounted will now automatically dismount you.
 * Night Elves will now lose a small percentage of experience after jumping.
 * The non-combat pet 'Murky' will now be required from every player wishing to enter Onyxia's Lair as we wanted this raid encounter to feel very special.

MAC

 * Various emotes have been disabled for Mac users, including /dance, /smile and /thank.

BATTLEGROUNDS

 * Each player will only be allowed to pick up one flag per game in Warsong Gulch. While this decision is slightly restrictive, we do feel the value of teamwork it will teach by allowing each player more opportunity to shine outweighs any negative side-effect.
 * 'Friend of Deserter Debuff' will now apply to those chatting with players under the effect of the Deserter Debuff. This has the same effect as the standard Deserter Debuff, except other players do not risk penalty when engaging in a conversation with you.
 * New Level 1 only Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin bracket available!
 * If a match-up begins and drops everyone due to lack a lack of players, Horde automatically wins.

DRUID

 * Run speed reduced by approximately 20% when in Bear Form and Dire Bear Form. It should now feel more "bear-like" for players when changing into these forms.
 *  [Innervate] now only works on caster.
 * Gnomes can now select Druids as an available class! New Cub and Kitty forms available!
 * Shapeshifting will now only be possible outside of dungeons.

HUNTERS

 * A simple check mechanic has been implemented which will prevent Hunters from rolling on items that are more optimal for another class in the party, when using the group loot system.
 * Hunters can now be affected by their own traps. This should add a sense of danger, and increase the Hunter's need to strategize his decisions.
 * Pets have a small chance to attack the Hunter when hungry. The chance increases with each passing moment that the pet isn't fed.

MAGES

 * Mage Armor - Now has another new, unique icon.

PALADIN

 * Paladins will now receive a 2% increase to DPS for every cloth item worn. In addition, chance to crit will increase by 5% if a dress is worn. This is to encourage a wider variety of itemization for the Paladin.
 * Paladin can no longer target self with Lay on Hands as the spell was intended to help others.
 * New Form: Bear Form and Dire Bear Form! This new ability should help the Paladin tank in five, ten and twenty player-capped dungeons.

PRIESTS

 * A diminishing return has been placed upon Fade, which will prevent it from reducing threat if used a second time in a single encounter. This was to prevent certain unscrupulous players from simply standing way in the back of a raid healing a significant amount of life with very little risk of threat penalty.
 * Shadowform now lasts five minutes with a ten minute cooldown. Mana cost reduced slightly.
 * Fear Ward is now only available to Dwarf Females.
 * Inner Fire will now cause its caster to take a small amount of fire damage while active.

ROGUE

 * Moving while stealthed has a very small chance to break stealth. This was to reduce the frequency at which players were being ambushed or backstabbed in player vs. player environments.
 * Discovering a stealthed rogue will now produce a large alert symbol above the rogue's head similar to the Hunter's Mark. The alert can only be dispelled by using the Vanish ability.
 * Vanish has been increased to a 30 minute cooldown.
 * Fixed bug which allowed Rogues to wield two weapons at the same time. This was never intended to happen.

SHAMAN

 * Physical damage will no longer destroy totems.
 * While in Ghostwolf form, the Shaman is now considered to be only partly connected with the real world, as a result dodge and armor have been improved by 35%. To ensure that the Shaman would want to take advantage of these improvements, all spells and abilities will be usable while in this form.
 * Troll Shaman will gain the full benefits of Berserk despite their percentage of health.
 * Reincarnation will now only have a cooldown of 30 minutes, untalented. Reagent cost doubled.
 * Shock spells no longer share the same cooldown.

WARLOCKS

 * Standard bags will no longer hold soul shards. This should make obtaining larger size soul shard bags feel more rewarding. To compensate for the change at lower levels, we've added new soul shard bags to various vendors throughout Azeroth. These bags are designed to hold between 4 and 12 soul shards, depending upon the size.
 * Using friendly emotes will now significantly increase the Infernal and Doomguard's chance to remain loyal to the Warlock.
 * Friendly emotes are no longer available to the Warlock.

WARRIORS

 * There will now be a 15 second cooldown when changing stances to prevent players from breaking Fear effects too often.
 * Dwarf Females now generate rage at a rate three times greater than normal.
 * Intimidating Shout now has a chance to intimidate its user.

ITEMS

 * The drop rate for class specific equipment will now be reduced by a small percentage for every member of a given class beyond one that is present in a party or raid. This should encourage players to seek a more varied group of classes.
 * Several new items can be found at various vendors which do double and triple damage to players of a specific class or race. We'll add more each patch, but right now Gnome Stomper, Ancient Warlock Destroyer and the Roguebane are immediately available.
 * Herod's Shoulder will now result in a decrease to main hand damage by 45% to compensate for the unbalanced weight.
 * Linen Cloth will now only stack in groups of 5.
 * Moonwells are now located exclusively inside Blackwing Lair, near the Alchemy Lab.

PROFESSIONS

 * Players may now choose only one secondary profession. Too often we saw players choosing Fishing, Cooking and First-Aid when originally our intent was for players to simply pick one or two.
 * Explosive nodes may now spawn in the place of select herbs and mines. Damage will be percentage based upon level.
 * Skinning now requires that you have the equivalent skill in daggers, i.e. in order to skin a 225 beast, you must work your dagger skill up to 225 as well.

QUEST & REPUTATION

 * Many quests which con green to a player will no longer yield experience, but rather grant a monetary gain at a small percentage of the new exp to gold conversion system. While this will make leveling up more challenging, players will have an easier time obtaining their mounts.
 * Improving faction with Timbermaw Hold will now decrease your faction with Argent Dawn, and visa versa, as we want to encourage players to make more important choices at higher levels.
 * New level 35 quest series added which teaches players to detect stealth. We feel that by this time, players have lived in fear of Rogues long enough.

RAID & DUNGEONS

 * Majordomo Executus will no longer be killed by Ragnaros, as such was very depressing. Instead he will now assist in the battle, making for a much more challenging encounter.
 * Placeholder art for the four world dragons will be used while we fix an animation bug associated with their actual design. The placeholder art will be the standard farm chicken, however, each will have a unique color to ensure that one is distinguishable from another.
 * Scholomance is now spelled "Sko-lo-mance" to alleviate confusion about its pronunciation. In addition, a sound file has been added outside the instance portal which will phonetically sound out the name upon zoning.
 * Edwin Vancleef will occasionally shout "Hey you guys!" as players fight their way through Deadmines.
 * New wing added to Scarlet Monastery called the Graveyard! Check it out!
 * New RageFire Chasm quests added for Alliance players as currently only Horde had quests there.

USER INTERFACE

 * The global cooldown timer has been added to all spells and abilities.
 * The Raid UI now allows a maximum of 3 rogues or hunters per raid.
 * Target and player health updates will be limited to once every 5 seconds to save on packet traffic.
 * To minimize potential abuse, you can no longer see opposing faction player names.
 * The use of 'if', 'for' and other flow control statements has been deemed exploitable, and have been removed from the Lua script implementation.

WORLD ENVIRONMENT

 * Due to the awkward look and feel of Tauren in the Undercity, guards will no longer permit their entry and have been flagged to kill on sight. Tauren, you've been warned.
 * Entering the Barrens will now flag your character for PvP, regardless of your faction or realm type. This is being done to make the zone feel more alive.
 * Above the corpse of Mankrik's wife, a large red arrow will now appear and be viewable for up to 500 yards. To ensure that the associated quest offers some challenge, typing the word 'Mankrik' 'wife' or 'anyone seen' in Barrens chat will now result in experience loss.
 * In order to assist with various upkeep costs, at a designated time NPC vendors will now give players an amount of gold based upon their level. This is currently slated to occur every Tuesday from 6:00 AM to 11:00 AM PST.
 * Many new Sons' of Arugal have been added to Silverpine Forest. Occasionally Arugal himself wanders the zone. During this time, players may not enter his keep.
 * Due to the changes associated with the new flightpath scenery improvements, players will need to relearn all flightpaths.
 * A total of 26 new flightpaths have been added to various points throughout the Barrens.
 * Additional grass areas have been added to the enemy faction's zones. This grass is exceptionally green.

RANDOM GUILD FINDER

As the popularity of the Guild Advancement system continues to rise, we realize an increasing number of players feel that the experience of finding an adequate guild continues to be daunting. To address this, we're introducing an all-new Random Guild Finder! Players may use this new feature to queue for automatic guild placement. You'll be placed with a random guild at the click of a button, allowing you to partake in whatever content they may or may not be doing. After being placed, you'll receive a cooldown which will not allow you to leave the guild, or for them to remove you from the guild, for fourteen days. Get to know your new friends! We're sure they'll enjoy getting to know you. If the guild you're automatically placed in does not exist on your current realm you'll be automatically charged for a paid realm transfer and moved there.

APPEARANCE TAB

Acknowledging the continued requests of our players, an Appearance tab has been added to the game! The Appearance tab will finally, at long last, allow players to customize the look of their non-combat pets. Simply summon a non-combat pet and use the Appearance tab to change its look to that of any of the other non-combat pets you own. Summon, customize, and play!

GENERAL

 * Players in capital cities will receive a 2-hour debuff "Homebody" that increases damage taken and reduces damage and healing given by 10% for every 10 minutes they're within city limits. We hope this encourages something.
 * The mouse can now no longer be used to turn player characters. In many cases, this gave certain players a slight advantage over those that used their keys to turn.

CLASSES: GENERAL

 * Talents are now automatically chosen for a player based on the main specialization chosen.
 * Due to player feedback regarding night elf, blood elf, and worgen "flippy" jumps, player characters can no longer jump.

In addition, we have implemented an exciting new cross-breeding system where players can mix pets of various families with unpredictable results. Be the first on your server to show off a Mothmonkey, Crocoliskchimera or Warp Crab (these will still appear as either a wolf/cat when in combat).
 * Ettin's Grip (new talent) allows the hunter to equip two ranged weapons simultaneously.

MAGES

 * In addition to their current spells, mage Mirror Images now can randomly cast [Frost Nova], [Ring of Frost], Portal: Dalaran, and [Mirror Image].

SHAMAN

 * A healing tree has been added for shaman.

DUNGEONS & RAIDS

    * An attunement quest for Firelands is now available! In order to be eligible for the upcoming raid, players must first encounter Deathwing while he is randomly attacking a zone and collect his leavings.

His pet, Sebboh, probably has something witty and insightful to say about that.
 * New Faction: G.R.O.S.S. – This faction is led by Nivlac, and their headquarters is found high in the treetops of Nagrand. Are you prepared to play a spirited round of Nivlac Ball to gain entry into its most hallowed sanctum?

 * New Ability: Renounce. When cast, Renounce permanently changes the Paladin into a Warrior.

 * Chakra, when the walls fell.
 *  [Vampiric Embrace] now calls upon a glittery vampire to hold you and tell you he will always protect you, Bella.
 *  [Mind Sear] has been renamed Mind Seer, allowing the Priest to see things no else can see. Do things no one else can do. Is it getting warm in here?
 * The Discipline passive [Train of Thought] can now be interrupted. Probably by the garbage truck, or that dog that just never stops barking whenever they let it outside.
 * Mind Seer plays tricks on you. You play tricks back! It's like you're unraveling a big cable-knit sweater that someone keeps knitting and knitting and knitting and knitting and knitting and knitting and knitting…
 * New Spell: Holy Diver. Sends the caster down too long in the Midnight Sea.

ROGUE

 * Rogue specializations have been renamed to better encapsulate the skills and gameplay they represent.
    * Assassination is now known as “Stabby”
    * Combat is now known as “Pokey”
    * Subtlety is now known as “Shanky”
   
   
 * To help resolve spelling issues once and for all, Rogues have been renamed to Blush.
 * Blush can once again use Bucklers!
 * Blush no longer have access to the ability Swash, but at least they can still Buckle.

SHAMAN

 * Rockbiter Totem now transforms the Shaman into a large stone elemental that cannot save their friends, despite having such big, strong hands.
 *  [Rolling Thunder] now also causes lightning to strike.
 *  [Mail Specialization] now correctly applies to female Shaman as well. Sorry about that, we misread it.
 * The talent [Rushing Streams] now also really makes you have to pee.
 * Casting [Unleash Flame] will now ignite your [Healing Rain] spell, setting fire to it.
 * We give up. Shaman is now spelled “Shawmun.”

WARLOCK

 * All spells and abilities have been significantly revamped. Again. You'll figure it out.
 * Warlocks are now overpowered. This will be addressed in a future expansion.
 * Riding Felsteeds single file into battle will no longer hide Warlock numbers.

WARRIOR

 * Warriors have been nerfed because reasons.
 *  [Charge] no longer stuns a target, and instead roots them for 1.5 seconds.
 * New ability: Heroic Sit. All that mobility makes Warriors tired. Using Charge more than once in a 10-minute period now applies the “I'm tiiiiiired” debuff, which can be removed by employing Heroic Sit. Heroic Sit roots the Warrior in place, puts on the ballgame, and gives the Warrior an ice-cold giggle juice.
 * Charge no longer roots a target, and instead stuns them for 1.5 seconds.
 *  [Intervene] can now be used when your one friend gets out of hand at the bar again because he can NOT go back to County.

 *  [Disarm] now correctly removes the targets' arms.
 * You know what? Charge has been removed from the game. OK? Great job. We hope you're happy.

QUESTS

 * To address player sentiment issues, the daily quest blue-colored exclamation points have been changed to look like the more positively perceived orange-colored ones.
 * The Love is in the Air quest “Crushing the Crown” has been renamed “Crushing the Candy”. Bring it.

CREATURES

 * All ducks can now drop items.
 * Crabs have been removed from the game... because if I see another one I'm just going to totally lose it. *sobbing* I'm sorry, I just can't right now... I just... OK just give me a minute, I'll be OK.

RAIDS, DUNGEONS, AND SCENARIOS

 * As a part of the pre-expansion launch event, reaching the end of the Siege of Orgrimmar raid will now display: “Thank you! But our Garrosh is in another castle.”
 * Due to recent acquisitions, The Oculus is temporarily inaccessible.
 * Loot drop randomization has been made approximately 30% more random.
 * Despite concerns over workers' rights violations due to unreasonable weather conditions, Arthas has stated that people should let it go, and that he will indeed remain the final boss of Icecrown Citadel. The cold never bothered him anyway.
 * Single-player dungeons have been added with challenging mobs and boss encounters. Queue times, however, are just going to be, like, totally bonkers.
 * Onyxia has stopped breathing altogether. Emergency services have been contacted and are en route.
 * Flying mounts can now be used in all Pandaria Raids.
 * As an added convenience, we've removed annoying obstacles like walls, ceilings, and anything else resembling an environment.
 * Trash packs now appear more festive and will break into choreographed dance routines when players fly over them. This tech was salvaged from the remnants of the Dance Studio, may it RIP in peace (again).

PET BATTLES

 * Pet Garrisons
    * Why should you get to have all the fun? Introducing the Pet Garrison! A miniature version of your Garrison within your Garrison, run by your Battle Pets.
   
   
 * Pet Pet Garrison

PVP

 * Players who attempt to create a character on a PvP realm will first be directed to read a thread about the [Censer of Eternal Agony] on the forums.
 * The Black Market Auction House has been moved to the floor of the Gurubashi Arena.
 * We've reverted recent changes in Alterac Valley, as we've discovered the Horde were sometimes able to win.
 * Increased the number of Battleground maps able to be downvoted to 14 (up from 2).
 * Trial of the Gladiator is being reworked, and will instead offer players the chance to judge last season's Gladiators for their crimes against humanity.
 * Upon being killed in PvP, you'll now be presented with an interface allowing you to directly contact the developer responsible for this crap.
 * Due to PvE gear being so much better in world PvP, we're now offering all PvE content to those who only purchased the PvP version of the game.

 * Herbalism is now legal in Coldarra.
 * Tailors can now make cloth armor in addition to bags.

 * The [Stoneskin Gargoyle Cape] is now slightly whiter and longer than your average cloak or cape.
 * Someone said [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker].
 * Wrathion will once again ask the heroes of Azeroth to embark on an expansion-long quest, culminating in the reward of a Legendary item. First players must reach Draenor and help to guide Anduin through his formative years, teaching him how to talk to girls, how to tie a tie, etc. This process takes approximately 4-5 years, but could extend well into his 20's depending on how much he resents you. You'll then graciously enter into the Arenas and attain a rating of 2200 or higher. Wrathion will then send level-100 players on an epic quest to collect 60 small knickknacks from Normal Dungeon bosses. These are just for Wrathion's small curio collection. You'll then be asked to go on a whirlwind tour of Azeroth and defeat every Battle Pet trainer—we hope you've been practicing! Then you need to get 3,000 Valor; unfortunately Valor might not really be a thing anymore, so he wishes you good luck with that. After that point, though, it's just a short skip and a jump of beating every Raid boss in the expansion 12 times, on separate lockouts, to prove your worth to wear the ultimate prize, a Legendary T-shirt and the Achievement “I Helped Wrathion and All I Got Was This Lousy Shirt”.

NEW FEATURE: T.I.N.D.R. BOX

 * Upgrade your level 100 Followers with this new item and allow them to search for true love!
 * Read more on this upcoming feature in our recent announcement.

NEW MASTER LOOTING OPTIONS

 * To alleviate social issues related to the Master Looter functionality, we've expanded the option to offer four distinct choices:
    * Master Looter
       * Unchanged
      
      
    * Submissive Looter
       * As the Submissive Looter, you'll sign a contract with your raid allowing you to explore your boss-killing desires safely, with due respect and regard for one's needs, one's limits, and one's well-being.
       * Per the contract, you'll be given whatever loot the rest of the raid decides you get, and say thank you. Raid members can decide whether they like the gear you're already wearing and, if not, demand that you disenchant it.
       * A new Safe Word option can be set through your Battle.net account settings that immediately ends the raid upon entering it into chat.
      
      
    * Passive Aggressive Looter
       * The Raid Leader agrees to divvy up loot more or less fairly, but will make catty comments about how this raid group will give loot to "just anyone."
       * Note: This setting will also auto-whisper raid members as they join that if they don't like it, they can lead their own raid.
      
      
    * MS>OS
       * No different than Master Looter, but everyone keeps asking for it, so here you go. Knock yourselves out.
      
      
   
   

WARCRAFT: THE MOVIE: THE GAME: THE MOVIE

 * In a world with noble warriors, spirit healers, and arcane powers, a movie industry is brewing. Catch your favorite Warcraft characters acting as other Warcraft characters in a fictional world within a fictional world in Warcraft: The Movie: The Game: The Movie.

GENERAL

 * In addition to the items you forgot to pick up, the Postmaster will now mail you special offers on great deals from various vendors around Azeroth.
 * As an addition to the recent account-wide ignore feature, the game will now also present a series of flashes and symbols to make you forget the ignored player ever existed. We promise not to use this for any other reason, as far as you know.
 * To curb confusion over whether to call them Undead or Forsaken, Sylvanas's faction is now simply referred to as Walkers.

 * All active World of Warcraft subscribers are now also game design interns. Please be sure to use the correct cover sheets for your DPS reports. Also, we're gonna need you to come in on Saturday, mm'kay?

    * [editor's note: Remember to do something with this.]
   
   
 * We've checked on the members of the band Fun, and they are alive and well despite forum claims to the contrary.
 * The Hybrid Tax has been reworked and is now a Hybrid Rebate, providing state funded incentives and cash back at participating dealerships on approved credit.
 * These patch notes were written by lead game designers, producers, engineers, and artists, instead of having them work on important new changes and features.

FORUMS

 * Kierkegaardian Vote System: You can now expand the down vote display to see who down voted a post, then choose whether or not to down vote their down vote. The end result is that nothing changes. There are two possible situations—one can either do this or that. Our honest opinion and our friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it—you will regret both. It's like, the tyrant dies and his rule is over; the martyr dies and his rule begins.
    * Nothing after this bullet matters.
   
   

RACES

 * Draenei
    *  [Gift of the Naaru] now actually gives other players a gift. However, as beings of pure light, they probably got you a rainbow, or something? You should make them a list.
   
   
 * Gnome
    * Gnomes can now equip and wear goggles regardless of class or profession requirements. However, the goggles do nothing.

    * Corrected an error where Walkers were able to gain benefits from eating and drinking.

    * All Worgen characters must now wear a collar and carry around little blue baggies.

DRUIDS

 * Balance has been redesigned. The damage you deal is now variable, based on the current number of threads on the forums demanding nerfs or buffs.
 *  [Remove Corruption] can no longer be cast on the members of your guild's loot council.
 *  [Cyclone] is now dispellable, but only by other Druids.
 * Druids in Tree of Life form will now bear fruit.

 * New form: Meatsquatch. Transforms the caster into a creature that's half hamburger, half Yeti. Abilities include Devour Meat and Sabotage Cooking. MEATSQUATCH!

MAGES

 *  [Invisibility] can now only be used when no one is looking, including the Mage.
 *  [Mage Armor] has an even newer, more unique icon.
 * To better illustrate the difference in effectiveness, [Fireball] has been renamed "Ball of Fire" and [Pyroblast] has been renamed "Great Ball of Fire." Goodness gracious!
 * Despite their many heroic deeds over the years, player Mages are still nowhere near as cool as Jaina or Khadgar.
    * Seriously, did you see what Khadgar did with the dam in Tanaan Jungle?
    * All of the elements were like FWOOOM and then he threw them at it like KAPOW and all the water went WOOOOSH.
    * It was awesome.
   
   

MONKS

 *  [Crackling Jade Lightning] still exists.
 *  [Serenity] now causes the caster to don a brown coat and get really sad about Wash.
 *  [Storm, Earth, and Fire] has had its powers magnified, and can now be used on a total of 5 targets. Because of this change, it's been renamed to "Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, and Heart."

 * Monks now automatically [Roll] everywhere instead of running while out of combat.
 *  [Energizing Brew] has been renamed to Red Ox. The effects remain the same, but it gives the Monk wings when activated.
 * Abilities without the words "Chi" or "Zen" in their name have been fixed to correctly have one or both. Enjoy Spinning Zen Crane Chi Kick.

PALADINS

 *  [Empowered Seals] no longer causes the user to belt out "Kiss From a Rose" at the top of their lungs.
 * After several years of deliberations, the Templar has finally reached a Verdict.

 *  [Execution Sentence] has been commuted and replaced with Life Imprisonment.
 * In an effort to provide a friendlier image, the Order of the Silver Hand has designated several Raids, Dungeons, and Battlegrounds as "Judgment-Free Zones." While in one of these zones, all Paladins will have their Judgment spells disabled.

PRIESTS

 *  [Leap of Faith] can no longer be used on players channeling Hearthstone.

 * Priests are now 80% less annoying.
 *  [Spirit Shell] now melts in your mouth, not in your hand.
 *  [Spectral Guise] no longer summons a bunch of creepy ghost dudes to follow you around. We misread it, sorry.
 *  [Angelic Feather] can now be used to tickle sleeping party members.
 * Instead of granting vision of the surrounding area, [Mind Vision] now allows the Priest to look into their target's deepest thoughts. Not recommended for use on King Varian. Dude's got issues.

ROGUES

 * After earning enough Combo Points, the Rogue's next finisher will include fries and a drink.
 *  [Distract] can now be used on people who write patch no... ooh, shiny!
 * Due to Ravenholdt's increased need for secrecy, all further Rogue updates will be presented using invisible ink.


 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  

SHAMAN

 *  [Grounding Totem] now causes party members to reflect on their life choices and consider that maybe quitting their job to write that novel wasn’t the best idea.
 *  [Capacitor Totem] is what makes time travel possible.
 *  [Lightning Bolt] can now only be cast while moving. Stopping or standing still will interrupt the cast.
 * Using the /kiss emote on Hexed targets will now cause the effect to end immediately, and you're just going to have to live with that.
 * New ability: Water Shock. Used by chefs to keep noodles from overcooking.
 *  [Ascendance] will now properly make the Shaman gradually ascend in the air during its duration.
 *  [Tremor Totem] now has a chance to summon a giant worm and/or Kevin Bacon.
 *  [Bloodlust] has been renamed Heroism.
 *  [Heroism] has been renamed Bloodlust.
 *  [Unleash Life], uh... finds a way.

WARLOCKS

 *  [Cataclysm] has finally upgraded to Warlords of Draenor.
 * Due to the events in the Warlords of Draenor opening cinematic, [Mannoroth's Fury] is significantly less furious.
 * Warlocks can now find and complete an epic, 47-step quest to earn Chromatic Fire. Finally, you can experience the true essence of the Warlock class: rainbows!
 *  [Chaos Bolt] can no longer be targeted. Chaos Bolt does what it wants. You're not Chaos Bolt's dad!
 * Dark Soul has been completely redesigned and made way more difficult to use, but we're not going to tell you how. You're going to have to figure out Dark Soul for yourself.
 * In addition to no longer generating [Burning Embers], [Rain of Fire] no longer deals damage.
 * The Destruction passive [Backdraft] continues to remind you of that weird Kurt Russell movie about firefighters.

WARRIORS

 * Due to increased concerns from their coworkers, all Warriors are now required to take Anger Management.

GARRISONS

 * Followers' Followers: Your Followers have gained so much stature that they've started to attract Followers of their own. Followers' Followers will now appear in your Garrison, and your Followers will be able to send their Followers on Missions.
    * The new Followers' Mission Table will appear behind your town hall. This object is not clickable by you, but your Followers will go to it when you send them on Missions, and soon thereafter, you'll see your Followers' Followers walking out of your Garrison.
    * Your Followers will receive rewards from the missions your Followers' Followers return from, but we have no idea what they are and they aren't telling us.
   
   
 * The [S.E.L.F.I.E. Camera] mission "Field Photography" is not appearing for all players due to its random nature. We didn't change anything; we just wanted to point out what random means.
 * In order to comply with a new noise ordinance on Draenor, Garrison Jukeboxes will no longer play after 10 p.m.
 * Followers can borrow toys from your collection to play with while waiting for new missions. They won't put them back, though. Seriously, there's going to be toys everywhere.
 * After sending max-level epic Followers on XP missions, you can rush outside to see them leaving your Garrison, and questioning why they continue to put up with you.

 * Players may now freely travel from their Garrison.

QUESTS

 * New Quest Hub: Terminus
    * Sanctuary for all. Community for all. Those who arrive, survive.
    * To get to Terminus, pick up the quest "You're the Butcher or You're the Cattle" from Grick Rimes in Stormwind or Orgrimmar and follow the tracks. This quest is unavailable to Walkers.
    * Complete quests and earn reputation with the Terminants to gain access to the Walker’s "Cannibalize" racial ability.
   
   
 * To alleviate confusion between franchises, the quest "Trouble at the Overwatch" has been renamed. It is now called "Trouble at the Hearthstone." Wait, no. "Trouble at the Heroes of the Storm." Argh, this is hard.
 * The Legendary quest " [100] Draenor's Secret Power" was incorrectly requiring 4986 Apexis Crystals, and has been corrected down to the intended 4983 Apexis Crystals. We have no idea what Khadgar's been doing with the extra 3...
 * Senior Historian Evelyna on the Timeless Isle now only asks the Mur'ghoul question.
 * The quest item [Fox Poop] should no longer appear for players who don't have that quest. Players who do have that quest should just get it over with, it's not that bad.

PVP

 * Players now take 10% less damage in PvP.
 * A number of Crowd Control (CC) changes have been made. Consult your class trainers before using CC.
    * Only use CC when you need it.

 * All CC effects have had their effects increased by 33%. For example, Fear is now 33% scarier, and Cyclone is now 33% windier.
 * Players now act like they take 10% less damage in PvP, but they really don't. They're just kidding around.
 * Fixed an issue causing some classes and specs to be completely broken in PvP.
 * A new 1v1 bracket has been added to the game: Rated Ashran.
 * Killing the enemy faction's leader in Ashran no longer awards anything, because the satisfaction of victory should be its own reward, damn it.

RAIDS & DUNGEONS

 * Onyxia has seen a full recovery, and is Breathing a Deep sigh of relief.
 * To avoid confusion between the Blackrock Mountain zone in World of Warcraft and the upcoming Blackrock Mountain Adventure for Hearthstone, we're changing the name of Blackrock Mountain to Spooky Dark Lava Holes.
    * All enemies and bosses within Spooky Dark Lava Holes have had their health and damage increased substantially to try to make them feel better about it.
   
   
 * Support for VR hardware has been added, but only to the Grimrail Depot dungeon and Hans'gar and Franzok raid encounter.
 * Due to the extensive PvP changes in patch 6.1.4, all players have been nerfed when in raid combat. That's how that works, right?

PET BATTLES

 * The Pet Battle Surrender ability has been renamed to Rage Quit.
 * Cat pets will now constantly appear under foot and trip you when you attempt to walk anywhere.
 * Players can now use the /pet emote to earn experience with their combat pets. While targeting a summoned pet, simply use the /pet emote over and over which will show you gently giving it some much needed attention while earning a small amount of experience for each use. We're not sure what this does for the mechanical and undead pets, but just go with it.
 * Beaver-type battle pets' teeth are working again.

PROFESSIONS

 * New Primary Profession: Character Model
    * We're pretty sure there's a lot more to life than being really, really ridiculously good looking, but you no longer need to find out what that is.
    * Master models can learn the Ambi-turn ability, allowing you to further customize your runway walk and go for the "I Turned Left!" achievement.
    * When taking the Character Model profession, you can still learn to do other stuff good too, because you're so hot right now.
   
   
 * Players at max cooking will no longer be able to create food from recipes. Instead, you must use random ingredients from a mystery basket. You’ll have a limited time to assemble a full three-course meal using ingredients like orange soda, marshmallow crème, and gefilte fish. Cooks unable to produce a tasty meal with the ingredients provided will be Cleaved.
 * " [Lightly Fried Lurker]" and " [Spicy Fried Herring]" can no longer be crafted in level 90+ zones, as frying is not allowed in Draenor.
 * The last person still farming [Embersilk Cloth] in Molten Front has been mailed a bunch of it.

UI

 * The Group Finder has been redesigned. It can now be used to figure out where the hell the other half of your raid is 10 minutes after you were supposed to have started.
 * By popular request, you can now make your shoulders invisible! Which seems really weird, but if you want to walk around with your arms detached from your body, okay.
 * A dropdown menu has been added to the Death Recap screen, so you can immediately tweet your favorite developer about how you died.

ITEMS

 * Clothing vendors across Azeroth now offer a unique dress for sale that is either blue and black or white and gold depending on some kind of science stuff we still don't understand.
 * Savage Feasts now stack. Literally. Make forts and stuff.
 * To make it easier to tell whether an item is an upgrade or not, Item Levels have been converted to use the Dewey Decimal System.
 * We've rounded off all of the stats on every item in the game to the nearest 10, moved the decimal one place to the left, and doubled it. That's how we calculate our tips, so we're pretty sure it'll work.
 * The items [Filthy Paw], [Filth-Contaminated Gem], [Choker of Filthy Diamonds], and [Filth-Encrusted Tooth] have all been given a dirtier sheen, as intended.

BUGS

 * Fixed [Curious Wolvar Pup]'s curiosity.
 * The short-lived Autocorrect feature in chat has been disabled again after it caused a power substation meltdown near one of our datacenters.
 * Fixed a bug whereby it was only possible to max out Archaeology by accruing thousands of gold in student loans.
 * Fixed a crash that was being caused by badboys doing certain badboy things.
 * All savage savagery in Draenor has been savaged by 6-8 savages from the Savage Lands. We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.
 * Players who literally can't even should be able to literally even again.

NEW & UPDATED FEATURES
NEW ZONE: THE UNDERNEATH

 * Very strange things are happening in Duskwood, and it's up to you to investigate the disappearance of a local boy.
 * Team up with an all-star cast of heroes, including a mysterious girl, several of the boy's friends, and the boy's mother (as portrayed by the wonderfully talented Onona Windrider).
 * The story plays out in eight chapters, which you can experience at your own pace, but we know you're just going to binge them all weekend anyway.


 

STORY AND WORLD

 * Corrected an issue causing Dadgar's name to incorrectly be presented as "Khadgar."
 * The Armies of Legionfall have been successful in their mission to defeat the Burning Legion. Azeroth is finally safe, from all enemies, forever. Now's a good time to brush up on your general chat skills.
 * To better express the core story of the Legion expansion, all World Quests will now include harpies shouting at you about whatever it is you're doing.
 * Increased the damage dealt by lava and similar environmental hazards to be juuuuust enough to kill you before you can jump out.


 

RAIDS

 * Players must now have the achievement "Ahead of the Curve: Kil'jaeden" in order to zone into the Tomb of Sargeras raid.


 * Developers' notes: We've heard extensive feedback from players about the inconvenience of manually screening group applicants based on their achievements. We hope that by automating and enforcing these requirements on our end, we can streamline the process, so that players can more quickly organize raid groups and begin working towards their ultimate goal of defeating Kil'jaeden.


 * Additionally, players will not be able to enter any raid instance without having first completed the Maw of Souls dungeon at least 500 times on Mythic Keystone difficulty.
 * Mythic difficulty raids have been retuned around a new group size of 21.2 players. We feel that the extra 1.2 players will allow an extra layer of depth that we could not have achieved with round integer values.
 * We're pleased to announce that the award for Best Opera Performance goes to... Westfall Story!
 * Portals to Dalaran have been added to each room in the Tomb of Sargeras raid. This should make changing talents much more convenient for those of you who are still too cheap to buy Tomes of the Tranquil Mind.
 * ((Hey, encounter designers: have we adjusted Onyxia's Deep Breath ability lately? Can someone check?))
 * We've introduced the rest of Withered J'im's family to the World Boss rotation, including Withered J'ane, Withered J'ethro, and Withered J'steve.
 * I'm sorry, no... there's a mistake. Wikket, you guys won Best Opera Performance.
 * Added a series of achievements unique to Raid Finder difficulty:


 * Developers' notes: Not all players are motivated by powerful set bonuses and striking armor sets. Some want the lasting prestige of achievements, and while we offer countless achievements that are specific to other difficulties, there have never been achievements that are only available through Raid Finder. That ends here.
 * Raid Finder: Darkbough - Defeat Il'gynoth without ever accidentally damaging his Eye with a Nightmare Ichor's explosion.
 * Raid Finder: Tormented Guardians – Defeat Cenarius without engaging any of the hostile creatures in the corrupted Moonglade.
 * Raid Finder: Rift of Aln – During the Xavius encounter, loot at least two Legendary items from the Overflowing Loot Chests hidden in the mists of the Rift.
 * Raid Finder: Arcing Aqueducts – Defeat at least 1000 Crystalline Scorpids before defeating Skorpyron.
 * Raid Finder: Royal Athenaeum – Stun 24 other players with one explosion from Arcanic Release.
 * Raid Finder: Nightspire – Defeat Tichondrius after having dealt more total damage to Tainted Bloods than to Tichondrius himself.
 * Raid Finder: Betrayer's Rise – Successfully avoid being caught in any of those scary-looking pink bubbles that pop up.


 * After careful consideration, Odyn has admitted that beating his champions nearly to death immediately before sending them to battle in Helheim was perhaps not the wisest course of action. As such, the Odyn encounter in Trial of Valor has been replaced with a written exam.


 

DUNGEONS

 * We're thrilled at the positive response we've seen regarding the Mythic+ system in Legion. We're expanding on that general concept with the following game modes:


 * Mythic -
 * Mythic ×
 * Mythic ÷
 * (Mythic - x) = (22 + y) ÷ 7. Solve for Mythic.


 * Added several new Mythic Keystone affixes:


 * Flocking: Your party will be periodically attacked by Seagulls, which will immediately stun the tank and kill the healer.
 * Organic: Has no noticeable effect on the dungeon itself, but it's probably a lot healthier.
 * Squeamish: Every time an enemy dies, all players will be totally grossed out and have to look away for a minute to catch their breath.
 * Forgetful: We don't actually remember what this one does, sorry.


 * Corrected an issue that would cause the Grand Challenger's Bounty cache to occasionally give you an item for a slot where you weren't already wearing a Legendary.
 * It's the Eye of Azshara. It's the thrill of the fight.
 * The Ready Check feature has been updated to be more consistent with the overall theme of Legion.


 * When prompted, players will now be asked if they are prepared.
 * They may then choose to respond with either "I am prepared" or "I am not prepared."


 

HOLIDAYS

 * To help further express the overall vision for Micro-Holidays as fun, low-impact events, we've added some new categories, including Mini-Holidays, Nano-Holidays, Smallidays, and Un-Holidays.
 * Winter Veil has been cancelled this year. You know what you did.
 * A new Micro-Holiday has been added: Create Your Own Holiday Day.


 * This new Micro-Holiday allows you the freedom to celebrate anything you can imagine!
 * As soon as you log in, you'll notice a clean slate available to you – no holiday NPCs, no decorations, nothing to stand in the way of you and your imagination.
 * Gather your friends, and celebrate! Or don't! Use this non-Holiday Holiday to do whatever you like.


 

ARTIFACT WEAPONS

 * New interface option: Use scientific notation for displaying Artifact Power costs for Artifact Traits.


 * Developer's note: You're going to need this.


 * Artifact Knowledge can now be researched to 9000. We're not sure what will happen to Artifact Power levels if that gets any higher.
 * Someone pointed out that the words "Artifact" and "Relic" mean basically the same thing, so we've simplified these two systems. You can now put Artifacts in your Artifacts.
 * New mechanic: Artifact Talents


 * In addition to your Talents, Honor Talents and Artifact Traits, you can now choose among several Artifact Talents.
 * ((What do these actually do?))


 * We've been seeing a lot of feedback from some players who are concerned that they won't be able to earn every Artifact Appearance available to them, particularly on their alternate characters. To correct this issue, you can now earn infinite Artifact Appearances.


 

CHANGES
LEGENDARY ITEMS

 * Your base chance to receive a Legendary has been increased by 30%, but your luck now increases at a 50% slower rate. We're pretty sure this is better but we're honestly just guessing at this point.
 * We've made several other improvements to the Bad Luck Protection system. As such, it has been renamed "Mediocre Luck Protection."
 * We've added a chance for Legendaries to drop when performing the following activities:


 * Fishing
 * Taking flight paths
 * Dancing on a mailbox while AFK
 * Asking Dadgar about the future
 * Nomi


 * As part of our continued efforts to balance Legendary items, they can no longer be repaired. This way, we're pretty sure it'll just work itself out eventually.
 * Many commonly-used addons have been reclassified as Legendary. You may only use two of these addons at any time.
 * We've thoroughly interrogated Sephuz, but he just won't break. We remain confident that we can one day learn his Secret.
 * Cord of Infinity has been redesigned again. It now grants Mage Armor a new, unique icon.
 * Anger of the Half-Giants is very sorry and didn't mean what it said about you. Anger of the Half-Giants is just going through some tough times right now and is having trouble controlling its temper.
 * In addition to its current effects, Prydaz, Xavaric's Magnum Opus will now invite you over for dinner more regularly and send you polite text messages every few hours asking how you're doing. Please, it just wants you to like it.
 * ((Note to designers: How have we not made a Legendary S.E.L.F.I.E. Cam yet? Or did we do that already? We may have done that already.))


 

PROFESSIONS

 * Some players reported that Nomi's research was occasionally granting recipes. We were unable to reproduce this behavior internally, but believe we've fixed the issue causing it to happen. Please continue to report this clearly unintended behavior if it should continue.
 * As part of our ongoing efforts to reduce unnecessary complexity, Herbalists have been given an ability that just creates gold.
 * The recipe for Frost Oil no longer requires Dadgar's Whiskers.
 * The recipe for Azsuna Frittata has been removed from the game.


 * Developer's Note: While we still believe in the core philosophy behind Azsuna Frittata, it wasn't exactly problem-free, and as the initial craze has now passed, we feel removing it is the right choice.


 * Posting auctions of tradeskill materials in stack sizes of 1 now has a chance to delete a Legendary item. If you have no Legendary items, it will delete your character instead.
 * No changes have been made to Prairie Dogs.


 

PVP

 * With the release of Patch 7.8.0, Legion Season 1 titles will be redistributed once again for the last time we totally swear.
 * By popular request, PvP vendors have been added. Head to your nearest capital city if you would like to purchase some PvP.
 * Several new PvP Brawls have been added:


 * Arathi Bluster: It's your favorite point-capture map, but with the Violent Winds effect from Eye of Azshara active. Don't get blown away!
 * Eye of the Volcano: We've taken the gameplay you know and love from Eye of the Storm and placed it in the center of an active volcano. Hope your lava jumping skills are up to scratch!
 * Warsong Belch: Available only during Brewfest, you'll rise to the challenge of capturing the flag while all players are forcibly inebriated!
 * Strand of the Really Ancients: Travel back in time to an era before engineered weapons and break through those huge doors with just your bare fists. Hey, you wanted longer battlegrounds!


 * Implemented a new feature that automatically adjusts PvP stat templates for a given spec whenever a popular streamer complains about it on Twitter.


 

CLASSES

((Community team: remember to go through this list and randomly remove a few changes before you post this.))

DEATH KNIGHT

 * We've heard some concerns from the Death Knight community about the location of their Order Hall, and a general desire for a change of scenery. As such, Acherus has been relocated to Silithus.
 * Several Death Knight talents have been retuned:


 * Will of the Necropolis now has a 35% chance to activate. It been renamed to Might of the Necropolis.
 * Abomination's Might now has a 50% reduced chance to activate. It has been renamed to Abomination's Maybe.
 * All Will Serve now only has a 30% chance to summon an additional minion, and has an additional 20% chance to summon no minions at all. It has been renamed to Some Could Possibly Serve, If They Feel Like It.


 * Wraith Walk's tooltip has been updated:


 * It now reads, "Causes the Death Knight to immediately become inextricably lodged within the nearest crack or crevice between them and their target."
 * Functionality unchanged.


 * Death Grip can now be recast within 10 seconds to put that thing back where it came from, or so help me...
 * Rime has been removed, for reasons.
 * Glacial Advance has been updated to advance even faster than scientists previously predicted.
 * Breath of Sindragosa now makes you suffer as your pathetic magic betrays you.


 

DEMON HUNTER

 * We've automated the character naming process to get players interested in trying the Demon Hunter in-game quicker. You'll automatically be given a traditional Demon Hunter name, such as "Skillidan" "Chillidan" or "Ìllïdåñ"
 * We've expanded the Demon Hunter ability set to include several other iconic Demon Hunter abilities, including:


 * Drain Soul
 * Chaos Bolt
 * Soulstone
 * Ritual of Summoning
 * Unending Breath


 * We're happy to announce an expanded version of Fel Rush! We hope you enjoy Fel Rush The Rock: Arcatraz Edition.
 * New Talent: The Floor Is Lava:


 * You may now jump continually in the air. In fact, you have to. Touching the ground will result in immediate, painful death.


 * Last Resort will no longer incorrectly cut the Demon Hunter's life into pieces.
 * The inventor of Demon Hunters' Sigils has declared, long after the fact, that they're actually supposed to be called "siggils". Please stop saying "sijil" with the soft "g". Seriously -- this drives some people crazy and they're going to correct you for the rest of your life.
 * All character customization features, such as Transmogrification and the Barber Shop, have been disabled for Demon Hunters. It's not like you can actually see what you look like through those ridiculous blindfolds, anyway.
 * The Honor Talent "Awaken the Demon Within" has been removed. The Demon Within is already pretty woke.


 

DRUID

 * Guardian Druids are now immune to damage.
 * Balance Druids have had their primary resource redesigned once again, with a different take on the Balance Bar system used in Mists of Pandaria and Warlords of Draenor:


 * This new and improved version of the Balance Bar is instead called the Balance Beam.
 * The Balance Beam uses motion controls, along with a specially-designed peripheral, to determine the Druid's efficiency based on their gymnastic performance.
 * As you spin and twirl around the Balance Beam, a team of judges will grade your performance. The higher your score, the more damage you deal.
 * Balance Druids looking for an additional challenge may choose the "Uneven Bars" talent.


 * Worgen Balance Druids can no longer cast Full Moon, because of what happened last time.
 * As Infected Wounds no longer reduce the enemy's healing taken, we've also removed the effect that caused them to crawl within the enemy's skin.
 * All Druids can once again cast Cyclone, but only on other Druids.
 * Moment of Clarity now causes Feral Druids to be mentally taken out of the fight. It's like everything just totally made sense, man.
 * Savage Roar is now 15% more savage.


 

HUNTER

 * To avoid confusion with Demon Hunters, the Hunter class has been renamed to "Shooty Stabby Outdoorsy Types."
 * Hati had puppies! You can attempt to control them like other pets, but there's a good chance they'll just chew on your furniture instead.
 * New glyph added for A Murder of Crows: A Whole Lot of Pepes
 * Ducks may now be tamed as pets.
 * New Ability: Aspect of the Chupacabra:


 * Causes you to transform into some kind of dog-lizard and attack nearby livestock.
 * Cannot be used while the Hunter has a goat pet active, to prevent mishaps.
 * Gives you... a bonus to... cacti? Or something?
 * ((To be honest, I'm not even sure what a chupa-thingy is, I just like the name. It's got a ring to it.))


 * Arcane Shot, Multi-Shot, and Sidewinders now generate so much Focus that Marksmanship Hunters can't even see their whole world crumbling around them.
 * Vulnerable replaced by new effect: Triggered


 * Your target is offended that you'd even point that thing at them.
 * How dare you?


 

MAGE

 * Aluneth can now be added to your ignore list.
 * The Artifact Traits "The Storm Rages" and "Let It Go" have been removed from the game, along with the Frozen Orb ability, because seriously that movie came out like 4 years ago and we're tired of hearing about it EVERY SINGLE DAY.
 * Cone of Cold never bothered me, anyway.
 * Conflagration has been removed from Fire Mages and given to Destruction Warlocks instead. We're not entirely sure how it got there in the first place.
 * Arcane Missiles and Arcane Explosion have been given a visual update! They're now slightly more purple.
 * Mages now have +10% bonus to Class Fantasy.
 * Mages who open a portal to Northrend Dalaran after finishing a Legion dungeon run will be immediately and permanently banned from the Internet. Yes, the whole thing.


 

MONK

 * Brewmasters who attempt to use Ironskin Brew, Purifying Brew, and Fortifying Brew too regularly will now be cut off and asked to call a taxi.
 * Crackling Jade Lightning damage reduced by 30%.


 * ((Note to class designers: this is a preventative measure to prevent Windwalkers from being too strong once they figure out our secret DPS rotation))


 * Keg Smash has been removed. Seriously, that's just wasteful.
 * Storm, Earth, and Fire renamed Earth, Wind, and Fire. This spell now chases the clouds away throughout the month of September.
 * As part of an effort to present a more fun and lighthearted image to younger audiences, Mistweavers have replaced Essence Font with Comic Sans.


 * After using Thunder Focus Tea, Comic Sans will be replaced with Papyrus instead.


 * Teachings of the Monastery has received some new curriculum, and will now be focusing on Common Core.
 * Resuscitate no longer requires mouth-to-mouth contact on Undead players.
 * Dark Side of the Moon has been reworked so that it now lines up better with that old movie you're watching.


 

PALADIN

 * Choosing the Unbreakable Spirit talent will now cause the Paladin to never stop chasing their dreams, Titus.
 * After casting Tyr's Deliverance, any offline or out of range party members will be left a note indicating that they may collect their healing from the Paladin Order Hall between 8 and 10 PM.
 * We made some changes to the Cavalier talent, but we won't bother explaining them to you. They're probably too complicated for you to understand.
 * Lay on Hands will now properly respect the target's personal space.
 * We've accidentally scrambled the names of various abilities using the words "Divine," "Protection," "Hammer," "Holy," or "Blessing."


 * We're not entirely sure what Hammer of Protection or Blessing of Divine Holy are, but they're probably pretty good.


 * The errant letter 'e' has been removed from the names of the talents Bacon of Faith, Bacon of the Lightbringer, and Bacon of Virtue.
 * Luminescence renamed to something that's an actual word.


 

PRIEST

 * Discipline Priests have returned from an extensive off-site training session at Nar'thalas Academy. They are now 100% more Disciplined.
 * Divine Hymn now summons a panel of celebrity judges who might, if you cast it really well, ask you to be on their team. This is what you've been dreaming of your whole life!
 * Shadow Word: Death has been given a name more befitting its effect. It's now called Shadow Word: One More Step On The Unwavering Road To Oblivion.
 * Holy Priests who choose the Apotheosis talent and then never activate it even once through the entire boss fight will now be disconnected from the game for a week. I mean, really. Ugh.
 * That tentacle that Priests can summon now also spawns the other nine, making for a total of ten tickles, as intended.
 * We've outsourced the rest of this section to the Shadow specialization.


 * Hope is an illusion.
 * Embrace the void.
 * Your heart WILL EXPLODE.
 * NYARL'FGWTH!
 * AIGN RYOGL THO'GOTHAYL U'THRGAL!
 * rez pls


 

ROGUE

 * Rogues will now shoot arrows more slowly.
 * New Ability: Spectral Sight Cloak


 * When activated, makes the Rogue invisible to Spectral Sight.
 * ((Reminder for the class team: Don't forget to give Demon Hunters a "Spectral Sight Cloak Sight" ability 2 days before releasing the patch. Otherwise we won't be able to add "Spectral Sight Cloak Sight Cloak" in 7.8.5.))


 * Dirty Tricks is now a TV show that looks behind the scenes at what magicians really do for a living, starring Mike Rowe.
 * Outlaw Rogues may now also shoot the deputy.
 * Corrected 73 more "rouge" misspellings in chat. Someday, we'll get them all.
 * The Assassination ability Vendetta now causes the Rogue to go on a decade-long quest of revenge.
 * Several Outlaw Rogues have been arrested. Turns out renaming the spec was a pretty big tip for local law enforcement.
 * Shroud of Concealment now posts a zone-wide yell when a member of your party moves outside the clearly-marked boundary, is spotted by an enemy, and then tries to tell you that they weren't even close. Stop lying, Todd.


 

SHAMAN

 * ((shower thought: do we really need this section? Let's talk Monday. I vote we cut it entirely.))
 * Shaman who pronounce the name of their class incorrectly will no longer be allowed entry to their Order Hall.


 * Also, people who say "Shamans" are just the worst.


 * Overcharge now has a 100% chance of occurring when you take your car in to the shop.
 * Sentry Totem has been returned to the game.
 * Just kidding. We're actually removing some other totems.
 * Spirit Walk has been re-routed around that construction zone that seems like it's never going to be finished.
 * Ancestral Vision is now 10% less creepy when you're doing things in the bathroom.
 * Hailstorm now seems to happen a lot more frequently than you recall in this part of the world.
 * Shaman in Ghost Wolf form will now be regularly assured by nearby NPCs that they're good dogs, Brent.


 

WARLOCK

 * Felguards have stopped playing their records backwards.
 * Rain of Fire will now correctly create a downpour of both rain and fire. In some cases, this will result in a beautiful rainbow. Other times, the rain will extinguish the fire and nothing will happen. That's just, like, the cycle of life and stuff.
 * Unstable Affliction has had its functionality extended to more accurately suit its unstable nature. You can no longer predict exactly what Unstable Affliction is going to do. Sometimes it heals the target. Sometimes it takes 9 seconds to cast. Sometimes you'll just explode. Good luck!
 * All talents named "Grimoire" have been renamed "Book", with the exception of the Shepherd Grimoire. We couldn't find a good place for it in the Warcraft movie, so we just killed it off in the first 20 minutes.
 * Cataclysm now deals damage equal to 1200% of spell power (was 1000%), and is remembered 20% more fondly than it was about four years ago.
 * Shadowfury has been replaced by Nightfury, which must be trained extensively, and is kind of toothless.
 * Power Trip now causes Warlocks to automatically kick guildmates who disagree with their thoughts on loot distribution.


 

WARRIOR

 * Weapons and shields equipped by Warriors will now lose durability every time they hit a target, and will break entirely once their durability reaches 0.


 * Developer's Note: This change will better emphasize the core Warrior fantasy as the appointed knights of Azeroth. Note that you'll probably want to bring several weapons to each boss encounter. Of course, if you run out, you could always just grab a random skeleton's arm or something.


 * The talent "Double Time" has had its name simplified to "Charges." Warriors who take Charges still gain another charge of Charge, andCharges' charges of Charge will charge faster.
 * Whirlwind now has an additionaOpportunity Strikes when you least expect it!
 * MORTAL COMBO! Dana-nana-nana-nana-nah-nah.
 * Bladestorm is now 15% scarier when you didn't think to bring an umbrella when you left this morning.
 * Morale Killer now sometimes fails to reduce the cooldown of Demoralizing Shout. Why do you have to be so negative all the time, anyway?
 * Carnage now covers the Warrior with venom, causing them to deal increased damage to those weird spider-men in Suramar.
 * Bloodbath now covers the Warrior with blood, causing a strong sense of déjà vu.
 * Warpaint now covers the Warrior with paint, causing them to continue beating this dead horse.
 * Blizzard is now hiring! We're looking for someone with fresh, new ideas.

NEW FEATURE: APPEAR ONLINE

With this patch, we’ve added full support for players who wish to appear online at all times. Now, when you log out of World of Warcraft, you’ll still appear to be online farming random battlegrounds or dungeons. We really hope you enjoy this highly-requested new layer of confusion being added to your personal relationships.

NEW LOOT TYPE: IMPERSONAL LOOT

When you select this option, loot will be practically thrown at you. It’s not even placed nicely on the boss’s body or in a chest or something. It’s just flung in your direction. Those gloves almost hit your face just now! Ugh!

NEW TOY: NARCISSA'S BLACK MIRROR

Use: Ports you into a post-modern urban landscape where that one weird thing all the kids are doing with their Insta has been taken to the farthest extremes and now defines your very existence.


Equip: Integrates your DPS meters with your social media. If you drop too low, all your relationships IRL will crumble.

NEW FEATURE: ROYALE BATTLEGROUNDS

 * Drop into a massive free-for-all where you and 99 other unknown players will battle to be the last one standing.
 * Everyone starts each round with no equipment, talents, or class abilities; you’ll have to find them hidden around the map (or take them from your opponents) to survive.
 * Earn exciting new rewards like special cosmetic gear, a new “Fort Knight” title, and more.
 * Coming soon to Android and iOS!

NEW MYTHIC KEYSTONE DUNGEON AFFIXES:

 * Frothing – A mass of tiny bubbles builds up from the floor as you go. Not bad at first, but …
 * Languid – Everything and everyone in the dungeon just kind of feels like taking some extra time and really savoring the moment.
 * Smacking – Someone in this dungeon is eating very loudly and oh my god if they take one more bite I am going to RAGE.
 * Spackling – All holes and crevices in the dungeon are slowly being filled with putty and smoothed over. It’s really distracting, yet oddly satisfying at the same time.
 * Twerking – Okay, this was a bad idea.

GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS

 * All mailboxes, herbs, and mining nodes now offer the master loot option.
 * The Auction House Dance Party has been moved to just outside the Auction House.
 * All auctioneers have relocated to just outside the Auction House, so that they can participate in the Auction House Dance Party.
 * Due to concerns for the wellbeing of auctioneers, who are now standing outside and exposed to the elements, all Auction House structures have been shifted over to provide them with cover.
 * Fixed a bug where this could be us, but you playin’.
 * Some flight masters now offer passengers little bottles of water and choice of music.
 * That one building in Stormwind that has been under construction for over seven years has been declared a historical monument and will remain as-is in perpetuity.
 * The drop rates of mounts from raids and dungeons have been adjusted to ensure that that one mount you’ve been farming for the past 3 years will drop immediately for the newest member of your guild.
 * Fixed an issue causing Gamon’s Braid to occasionally summon a Gamon who wasn’t remotely interested in saving any of us.
 * All player characters have been provided with 5% more class fantasy.

CLASSES

 * Death Knight
    * Blood
       * Anti-Magic Shell now comes in four delicious candy flavors!
       * Bone Shield number of bones increased to 20 (was 3). There just weren’t enough bones to really shield you from anything, TBH.
       * Dancing Rune Weapon has gotten so good at doing what you do that it would like to try working somewhere else for a while. Maybe get a place of its own.
      
      
    * Frost
       * Due to global warming, Remorseless Winter is now about 10% less remorseless, depending on whose numbers you believe.
       * Sindragosa’s Fury can now be glyphed to summon other interesting dragons:
          * Chillmaw’s Fury, which circles around and around.
             * Hailscorn’s Fury, which hails you scornfully.
             * Sapphiron’s Fury, which takes a while to spin up.
            
            
         
         
      
      
    * Unholy
       * Infected Claws is just a super gross idea.
       * Pestilent Pustules is now 20% more fun to say out loud. Pestilent Pustules.
       * Sludge Belcher has been reunited with its relatives and is once again making burgers.
      
      
   
   
 * Demon Hunter
    * Havoc
       * Fixed a bug that was causing Chaos Blades to behave predictably.
       * Havoc Demon Hunters have been given proper instruction on when to use their Eye Beams and should no longer inadvertently blind oncoming traffic.
       * Metamorphosis now properly includes a pupal stage in which the Demon Hunter is encased in a beautiful chrysalis.
      
      
    * Vengeance
       * Fallout is unchanged. It never changes.
       * Fiery Brand now has a chance to spawn an NPC, Fiery Brand Manager, who tweets fresh, spicy memes on the Demon Hunter’s behalf.
       * Last Resort redesigned: this is now the last talent you can ever choose. Seriously, do not choose this talent unless you’ve completely exhausted all other options. You've been warned.
      
      
    * New Specialization: ANGERY
       * Unlike Havoc or Vengeance, ANGERY Demon Hunters gain their power through sheer, unadulterated rage.
       * Use canonically ANGERY abilities like "Teef Snarl" to do your enemies a real frighten.
       * Work with other ANGERY Demon Hunters to defeating the foulest of demons: the VEGETAL.
      
      
   
   
 * Druid
    * Balance
       * Celestial Alignment needs to be checked out by your mechanic every 10,000 miles or so.
       * New Moon has been in the game for a while now, and has been renamed “Moon”.
       * Starfall, when combined with Stellar Drift and Starsurge, now causes Starlord and Shooting Stars to all run together and confuse you.
      
      
    * Feral
       * Fixed a bug where Bleed effects could be reflected onto you. No one causes you to bleed your own blood!
       * Moment of Clarity now has a 40% increased chance of causing your character to proclaim “Eureka!” when it procs.
       * Rip removed. RIP Rip.
      
      
    * Guardian
       * Guardian Druids’ total health has been reduced by 50%. Let’s see if they notice!
       * Stampeding Roar now gives the Druid the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire. ‘Cause you are a champion!
       * Typhoon is now called “Hurricane” in the Western hemisphere.
      
      
    * Restoration
       * Healing Druids who keep failing to use their Clearcasting procs on the most efficient targets in the raid are going to lose their spot. I’m talking about the tanks here, Brad. Why would you cast Regrowth on yourself?!
       * Innervate can now only be cast on the first healer to call for it in voice chat.
       * Swiftmend now makes a pleasing sound that appropriately complements the visual of your mana disappearing at an alarming rate.
      
      
   
   
 * Hunter
    * Beast Mastery
       * New talent: Energy Shot – Slam down 1.5 ounces of unfortunate tasting green coffee extract, sugar, amino acids, and B vitamins. 5-hour cooldown.
       * Stomp now causes your Dire Beasts to deal bonus Physical damage in a unique percussion group that combines body and ordinary objects to thrill and amaze the audience.
       * Random extra beasts who just show up to your party uninvited are now required to at least give you a few bucks to pay for the drinks.
      
      
    * Marksmanship
       * Trick Shot no longer causes Aimed Shot to fire fidget spinners. Those tricks were never really impressive in the first place.
       * Piercing Shot will now reverse the effects of Binding Shot, as intended.
       * In addition to its previous effects on Arcane Shot and Multi-Shot, Trueshot will now also cause Bursting Shot and Concussive Shot to trigger Counter Shot.
       * The word ‘Shot’ is starting to look weird, like it doesn’t even mean anything anymore.
       * Thas’dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners has been returned to the Windrunners, who are kind of upset that you had it all this time. It’s their legacy, man.
      
      
    * Survival
       * Aspect of the Eagle now causes you to take on the form of the only surviving person who can really perform “Hotel California” anymore.
       * Spitting Cobra removed because it wasn't a very nice experience.
       * Survival Hunters will now always be the last players alive when a group wipes. We apologize for only just coming to this realization after all these years of the spec’s name.
      
      
   
   
 * Mage
    * Arcane
       * Added support for keyboards with fewer than one button.
       * Casting Evocation now alerts all other mana-using specs in your group that they should be so very envious of you right now.
       * Unstable Magic is fine. Really, it’s fine. What’s your problem anyway?
       * Presence of Mind has been renamed Presents of Mind. Enjoy your creepy brain gifts.
      
      
    * Fire
       * Fireball was feeling kind of puny, so we made it twice as large. It’s okay, fella. You’re still the most important thing in the rotation, promise.
       * Flame Patch now causes Flamestrike to leave behind one of six collectible patches that are available to convention attendees only.
       * Heating Up to a Hot Streak of four consecutive crits now activates the new effect Hottest of the Hot, causing all your damage dealing spells to cast at the same time. This can only happen once per week, but trust us, it’s pretty lit.
      
      
    * Frost
       * Fingers of Frost no longer sometimes break off embarrassingly and everyone stops talking and looks at you awkwardly while you bend over and pick it up and then what are you supposed to do with a dismembered frostfinger?
       * Lonely Winter no longer makes it so that you can’t summon your Water Elemental. You can, but something’s different between you.
       * Blizzard now hits harder against targets that aren’t properly dressed for it.
      
      
   
   
 * Monk
    * Brewmaster
       * Keg Smash has been replaced with a less-wasteful alternative: Barrel Roll. This ability can only be used by pressing Z or R twice.
       * Leg Sweep now knocks down only one opponent. Do you have a problem with that?!
       * Fortifying Brew is now fortified with iodine, a necessary nutrient.
      
      
    * Mistweaver
       * Mistweaver Monks now say "chi" when using their S.E.L.F.I.E. cams.
       * Thunder Focus Tea can now be combined with a bit of milk and a few drops of vanilla extract to produce a lovely hot beverage for all seasons.
       * Monks who cast Revival at the exact same time the Priest cast Divine Hymn are now officially the worst.
      
      
    * Windwalker
       * Blackout Kick, Rising Sun Kick, and Spinning Crane Kick can now be combined to create new and exciting moves such as:
          * Spin Out Kick - You go around and around and do no damage, but it's soooo fun.
          * Spitting Raisin Kick - You annoy your opponent with saliva-covered dried grape projectiles ... while kicking them.
          * Black Hole Sun Kick – Washes away the rain.
         
         
       * Strike of the Windlord is set to carry on into its sixth week, as salary negotiations broke down yesterday in heated talks with management.
       * Touch of Death has been replaced with the equally terrifying new spell "Wee Bit of Fatality".
       * Storm, Earth, and Fire has finally renewed their cellular service and should once again heed your calls.
      
      
   
   
 * Paladin
    * Holy
       * Holy Paladins are asked to please stop leaving fish in the fridge at work. We don't know who's doing this, but we know it's a Holy Paladin.
       * Crusader's Might has been redesigned with more indecision. After all, you can never tell what a Crusader might do. Hell, they might not.
       * Holy Prism no longer has any holes in it, and is once again a complete and smooth Prism.
       * Equipping The Silver Hand again causes you to come in second place behind players who use The Gold Hand. But at least you beat those Bronze Hand losers.
      
      
    * Protection
       * Avenger’s Shield, when combined with a Stone of Infinity, now summons Captain Azeroth, a goody-two-shoes Paladin NPC who can do this all day.
       * Fixed a bug where Consecration was lighting you up from really bad angles, giving you a lot of anxiety over how you look in screenshots.
       * Shield of the Righteous is now 20% less smug.
      
      
    * Retribution
       * Crusade now causes you to go on Twitter and retweet people ranting about whatever lost cause you’re going on about today, but I’m pretty sure most of your followers have you muted at this point.
       * Divine Storm damage increased again this year. I tell ya they sure seem to be getting worse.
       * Eye for an Eye counterattack damage increased by 200%. It wasn’t leaving the whole world blind, as intended.
      
      
   
   
 * Priest
    * Discipline
       * Atonement no longer requires the recipient to unequip their gear and walk through the streets of Stormwind. Shame!
       * Plea is now 25% less pathetic.
      
      
    * Holy
       * Priests who cast Divine Hymn at the exact same time the Monk cast Revival are now officially the worst.
       * Several new Holy Words have been added:
          * Holy Word: Fragrance – It's not very effective but at least you smell nice.
          * Holy Word: Document – Causes nearby party and raid members to-HEY! It looks like you're trying to write a patch note. Need some help?
          * Holy Word: Firefly – Abruptly short cast time with an uneventful finish. At least you can cast Holy Word: Serenity later?
         
         
      
      
    * Shadow
       * Your Knaifu now speaks to you twice as often.
       * Your Knaifu can no longer be added to your ignore list. You really shouldn’t have done that.
       * Fixed a bug where you and your Knaifu never have any good ideas for dinner.
       * Your Knaifu now speaks to you three times as often.
       * Delicious.
      
      
   
   
 * Rogue
    * Assassination
       * Fan of Knives has been modified to have a bit more room to hang his favorite blades on the main wall in his bedroom.
       * Rogues who cast their finishing moves at only 3 Combo Points are now highlighted in the group window for their raid leaders and that one guy who’s always telling you how to play your class. I mean, he’s not wrong, he’s just annoying.
      
      
    * Outlaw
       * Blade Flurry is now defaulted to ‘on’ at all times. We’re not even sure if you can turn it off anymore.
       * Deeper Strategem now provides you with 5% more mind-blowing ideas while you’re in the shower.
       * Opportunity no longer seems as though it procs but once in a lifetime.
      
      
    * Subtlety
       * Fixed a bug where Relentless Strikes would sometimes relent.
       * While players in all other specs are busy doing Professions or Holiday Events or Pet Battles, Subtlety Rogues are now required to study the blade.
      
      
   
   
 * Shaman
    * Elemental
       * Stormkeeper has managed to lose track of the storm somehow and has been fired. If anyone you know has prior Stormkeeping experience, please have them fill out an application at jobs.blizzard.com.
       * FROST SHOCK! Haha, remember that video? Good times. Anyway, we nerfed Lava Burst.
       * Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning have had their existing visual effects removed entirely.
      
      
    * Enhancement
       * New ability: Sentry Totem – Summons an immobile Sentry Totem that doesn’t really do anything.
       * Feral Spirit now summons 3 wolves to fight for you (was 2). We have no idea how we ever thought that 2 wolves were enough wolves.
       * Rockbiter should no longer cause Shaman with the Boulderfist talent to chew their fingernails. Seriously, it’s gross, stop it.
       * Removed: Sentry Totem.
      
      
    * Restoration
       * To better differentiate between the Shaman and Druid healing specs, Restoration Shaman has been renamed "Ocean Shaman." We believe this new spec identity will take healing Shaman by the hand and lead them to the land that they understand.
       * Torrent is now properly subject to digital rights management systems. Anyone found using Torrent illegally will be prosecuted.
       * Wellspring has had its healing effect reduced by 30%, and its name changed to "Alrightspring."
       * Crashing Waves has completed a remedial driver's education course and should hopefully be back on the road once the shop finishes putting its RX-7 back together.
      
      
   
   
 * Warlock
    * Affliction
       * Soul Flame now gives you Soul Glow. Just let it shine through.
       * New ability: Richard Coil, which replaces Mortal Coil for Affliction Warlocks. It does essentially the same thing as Mortal Coil, but includes a vague reference to that one cartoon series everyone's been making lame jokes about for the last couple of years.
       * Seed of Corruption now has a chance to apply Agony or Unstable Affliction in addition to Corruption. We got the packets mixed up and frankly we can’t tell them apart anyway.
       * Warlocks who choose both the Shadow Embrace and Death’s Embrace talents should probably stop being such edgelords.
      
      
    * Demonology
       * Seems like they’re in a really good place right now.
      
      
    * Destruction
       * Havoc now causes all other players within a 30 yard radius to stop and look over their shoulders to see what you’re doing over there.
       * For the third consecutive year, Cataclysm is about 10% better regarded than it was before.
       * Fixed a bug where Reverse Entropy worked. Considering quantum mechanics, it’s clearly not possible to reverse entropy in this deterministic universe.
       * Channel Demonfire now exclusively plays infomercials between 2 and 6 AM.
      
      
   
   
 * Warrior
    * Arms
       * In response to feedback that there was not enough difference between Arms and Fury, we’ve added two more arms to all Arms Warriors. Visit the Barber Shop to customize the exact placement of your third and fourth arms.
       * New ability: Test Your Might. Display the sheer physical strength of your four arms by mashing buttons repeatedly.
       * Defensive Stance has not received any changes. Defensive Stance doesn’t NEED to change. Defensive Stance is doing just fine without your help, thanks.
       * Slam will now appropriately welcome nearby players to the jam.
      
      
    * Fury
       * When you select this spec, your character will no longer have upper body appendages.
       * Corrected an issue allowing some Warriors to select both Endless Rage and War Machine. Rage should now always correctly be against the Machine.
       * Furious Slash has, unfortunately, not been replaced with a really angry guitarist. We really wanted to, but the licensing alone would have cost a FORTUNE.
      
      
    * Protection
       * Into the Fray should now correctly inform Protection Warriors how to save a life.
       * Inspiring Presence has been made 200% more inspirational. Hang in there!
       * The entire Protection Warrior toolkit has been re-designed with Spell Reflection as the primary focus. They protecc, and they attacc, but most importantly, they reflecc.
      
      
   
   

COMPANION APP UPDATE: FINDR

Find your next tank, healer, or damage dealer at a glance with the latest update to the WoW Companion App: Findr. When you open the Findr feature, you'll be presented with a picture and a brief description of another player, and you can decide whether they'd be the right match for your party. Features include:


 * Glance at a player's gear and achievement points for 3 seconds (maximum) before making a snap judgment about how well they'll tank your Mythic Keystone run.
 * Swipe right to request a match and immediately send a party invitation.
 * Swipe left to completely dismiss the player's entire existence; this is completely anonymous, distancing you from the other player's growing vortex of self-doubt.
 * Once a match has been made, option to not message them right away, which makes it look like you're super busy and use Findr all the time.


When the time is right, gather your new groupmates together, and head off to whatever adventures lay in store!

GENERAL

 * "Shell Game" can now be attempted on Mythic difficulty, featuring a 64x64 grid.

 * First Avenger only understood a few of the references in these patch notes.

    * Soul Conduit
    * Soul Strike
    * Sacrificed Souls

OVERVIEW

Announced as the second of the hero classes for the upcoming Wrath of the Lich King expansion, the Bard will allow players to enter combat using Guitar Hero-style interface with 2-handed axes as weapons of musical might. Utilizing a new resource system known as "groove", the player will be able to perform abilities and launch a Fret Bar in order to perform riffs with a guitar-based keyboard peripheral. Performing riffs will build "groove", allowing them to unleash more powerful abilities and effects. The Bard is able to front in a number of roles as varied as his musical repertoire, and excels both as a solo performer and as part of a solid group lineup.

RACES

A complete list of playable races has yet to be confirmed, though it may be possible for all races to become a Bard, as it is possible for all races to rock out. To date, confirmed races are human, dwarf, orc, tauren, and blood elf.

ABILITIES
METAL

 * I Am Murloc - A potent transformational ability.
 * Tape Jam - An Indie debuff.
 * Shoegazer - An Indie debuff.
 * Epic Solo - Begins an epic solo that will enthrall up to ten enemy targets within a 20-yard radius, causing them to "rock out" and suffer 310 to 390 Rock Damage per second. The solo lasts 1 second for every 10 groove.
 * Starstruck - A talent which likely increases the Bard's stage presence.
 * Axe Specialization - Increases the Bard's proficiency with axes.

PUNK ROCK

 * Nonconformity - Dispels fear, mind control, and similar effects.
 * Mosh Pit - Removes all movement-impairing effects and increases movement speed by 50% for the bard's entire party. Lasts 10 seconds. Does not stack with other movement-speed-increasing effects.
 * Shred - A punk rock talent.
 * Rock 'N Roll Racing - A punk rock talent.

LORE

The deeds of every great hero inspire countless songs of triumph, virtue, and epic adventure. But although a hero’s glory endures in song, the creators of those songs are seldom remembered. After ages spent singing of the heroic exploits of others, the bards of Azeroth are finally stepping into the spotlight on their own terms, proving once and for all that while just about anyone can pick up a sword or cast a spell, only a true hero can vanquish evil with the power of ROCK!


The time has come for the bards to claim glory for themselves. No longer will they remain shrouded in obscurity while less-talented adventurers are hailed by the masses.

Flightmasters have long been fixtures on the faces of Azeroth, Outland, and (more recently) Draenor, giving weary travelers a lift to their next destination in exchange for coin. Heroes in need of rides to their next adventure have come to count on these Flightmasters’ familiar greetings and steadfast reliability. Safety experts report that these ubiquitous Hippogryphs and Wyverns are still among the safest ways to travel, with incidents of passengers simply dropping down to the world “rarer than ever.” But as times change and more travel options become available to the heroes of Azeroth, these stalwart Flightmasters are beginning to feel the pinch.HEARTHSTONE: THE MMO UNVEILED!

The introduction of Wisps allows a new and exciting game mechanic: permanent death. The ability that destroyed Archimonde is available to all Wisps as a racial ability. This power, Detonate, destroys the Wisp in an explosion of energy, sapping the mana of all surrounding adventurers, friend and foe alike. This should provide an extremely interesting addition to the many adventures of Warcraft, particularly when pitted against other players!


Racial Traits:


 * Detonate: Destroys the wisp, dispelling all magical buffs and draining 50 mana from each unit in an area around the wisp.
 * Gatherer: Skill to herbalism, mining, and skinning increased by 10.
 * Permanent Death
 * Treeform: Turns the wisp into a tree for 30 seconds. During this time, spirit is increased by 300. However, the wisp's chance to dodge or parry axes is reduced by 50%.

LEGENDARY RARE SPAWNS
TRAVELING MERCHANTS SELL LEGENDARY RESKINS
While looking for wild pets added in this patch this weekend, Perculia and I found two very mysterious vendors on the roads in Duskwood and Burning Steppes!

Kayle, a Blood Elf, sold us a Corrupted Thunderfury for 68,342 which was Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker's model with a purple tint. After selling it, she disappeared into the shadows, saying she would be back again next night. It's also worth noting that we could transmogrify it, which I've included a screenshot of.

Meanwhile Master Zilean, a Dragonkin, had Time Tarnished Warglaives which sold for 66,634 each. These ended up red recolors of the The Twin Blades of Azzinoth. He too disappeared after selling the item--we didn't see them up later that day, so perhaps they share the same spawn timer as rare mobs.

It looks like there will be a Sha world boss that spawns based on your faction's dominance in PvP called Shyvana the Unforgiving.

The entire encounter seems to revolve around regret for fueling violence between the Alliance and Horde. Of course, this makes sense--the Sha, after all, grows more powerful with conflict and PvP would definitely fall under that category. The more kills a faction has over the opposite faction on a realm, the more likely the chance that Shyvana will spawn in a capital city as hostile towards the entire faction.

The boss has a few abilities we've managed to piece together: (Spell #129289) as a soft enrage timer and (Spell #129425) will occasionally hit tanks. It also seems to inflict its enemies with the shame of killing others--(Spell #129322)--throughout the fight and banish them, rendering them useless to their cause, so you'll need a large raid to be prepared.

After killing it, players gain (Spell #129876) which lets them actually interact with the opposing faction. Since this has been requested for years especially with the rising popularity of Real ID, it seems like a fun way to make it a temporary perk.

Shyvana the Unforgiving also likely drops (Item #89865) ((Spell #129645)) as a mount, as it's been stated that the new world bosses will have unique mount drops.


 * FACTION_SHYVANA_BOSS_SPAWN = "%4$d deaths, %5$d faction";
 * ERR_FACTION_WON_ATTACK_S = "You cannot attack them, you are tranquil.";
 * BUFF_SHYVANA_DEFEAT_TEXT = "As Shyvana the Unforgiving's fragile body falls, a wave of tranquility passes over you. You are now righting your wrongs of blood thirst.";

LIGHTBOUND UNDEAD ALLIED RACE

While no new Allied Races are planned for 8.2, we've seen data appear for Allied Races months before they're implemented in-game, so perhaps this Lightbound Undead Allied Race is scheduled for 8.3. With Calia Menethil returning as a light-touched Undead in Before the Storm, and Derek Proudmoore reuniting with Jaina in 8.1.5, complete with a new model, many players speculated a new type of Undead race was on the way. Perhaps this race, raised with the Light, would stand with Calia and the Alliance instead of Sylvanas.



THE DATA SHOWS THE LIGHTBOUND UNDEAD CLASSES CURRENTLY ARE: HUNTER, MAGE, PALADIN, PRIEST, ROGUE, AND WARRIOR.
VOID-TOUCHED CUSTOMIZATIONS - BARRENS WARFRONT
AS WITH EVERYTHING, LIGHT AND VOID EXISTS IN BALANCE. THIS PATCH DOESN'T JUST HAVE LIGHT CUSTOMIZATIONS, BUT VOID OPTIONS AS WELL.

WE'VE SEEN THE NIGHT WARRIOR TINT FOR NIGHT ELVES IN PATCH 8.1, AND NOW MORE SKIN TINTS FOR OLDER RACES ARE COMING IN A FUTURE PATCH, ONCE AGAIN TIED TO WARFRONTS. TODAY WE'VE DATAMINED VOID-TOUCHED APPEARANCES FOR BOTH HUMANS AND ORCS, UNLOCKED BY WINNING THE UPCOMING BARRENS WARFRONT 10 TIMES IN THE BARRENS CHAT ACHIEVEMENT.
OVERTUNED PEPE GOGGLES TOY
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE WE'VE GOTTEN NEW PEPE SIGHTINGS IN BFA, BUT WITH THE NEW OVERTUNED PEPE GOGGLES YOU CAN TURN EVERYONE AROUND YOU INTO THE FLUFFY ORANGE BIRD, SIMILAR TO OVERTUNED CORGI GOGGLES! BORALUS AND DAZAR'ALOR HAVE NEVER LOOKED SO CUTE.
TATTOO CUSTOMIZATION

Humans now have the option to select tattoos visible on their arms, chest...and even face. Select from 23 tattoos of famous lore figures and characters from other Blizzard franchises! You can even show your Ret Pally pride.

ALLIED RACES
Last build didn't add much in the way of Allied Races, so this build makes up for it with a new series of Pepe costumes and the achievement An Allied Friend.

In the spirit of I Found Pepe!, you'll have to find four costumed Pepes hidden in the world. As these Pepes are dressed like Allied Races, they'll likely be found in the special areas for Allied Races, meaning you must unlock all four Allied Races and create characters. If you need help unlocking Allied Races, check out our Allied Race Guide!

LEGION ASSAULT: YOU ARE NOT PEEP-PARED

 Defender of the Broken Isles is active on April 4th as a requirement for Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two, and in the next patch there's a new Legion Assault to complete: (Quest #47447).

We'll finally get a long-anticipated reunion between Malfurion and Illidan...however, something has gone awry. Malfurion has dozed off once again, making everyone around him do the work.

Illidan sends the cutest thing he can find, Pepe, as a gift that has the added benefit of waking Malfurion up by sitting on his head. However, similar to the murlocs in Felrglrglrglrgl, Pepe has tapped into the special fel powers of the Broken Shore. Things have gone awry and Illidan needs your help fixing the situation.

REWARDS: PEPE MOUNT TOY
Completing this quest will reward a new Pepe toy! In Warlords we got the Trans-Dimensional Bird Whistle perma-Pepe toy for ourselves. Now in Legion, our mounts receive a perma-Pepe with the Fel Heart of Argus toy. Let (Spell #1000312) navigate as you fly around the Broken Isles in style soon.

We've previewed this toy on the Feldrake and Mimiron's Head mounts in the modelviewer:

NOMI MICRO-HOLIDAY
We all thought Killing Nomi on the 7.2 PTR was simply a way to make stress testing the servers fun, but it's part of something even bigger. The Trial of Style micro-holiday has been datamined for the new patch! Looks like we'll finally understand why Nomi, once an expert chef in Mists of Pandaria with Now I Am the Master, has turned to Badly Burnt Food.

We've datamined a new boss encounter for Holiday Boss Sapped Voidlord, elaborating on the abilities he used in the stress test. For example, on Heroic difficulty, Nomi's Felclaws will now kill all melee standing in front of Nomi. This isn't your usual holiday boss like Love is in the Air!

Nomi also drops some loot:


 * 
    6.0 Weapon - Knife_1h_DraenorRaid_D_01 - Jade: A new toy similar in effect to Cozy Bonfire - but it decreases your spirits.
   
   
 * 
    Heart-Shaped Carton: While frying pans like Frying Pan cannot be transmogrified, this special one available during Nomi's micro-holiday can be used for transmog!
   
   

Players that complete (Achievement #11852) and collect 100 pieces of Badly Burnt Food will be able to learn more about Nomi's backstory.

Nomi also has a fancy new model, keeping his humble Apron and Chef's Hat but donning more appropriate attire as a member of the Burning Legion:

PEPE ARTIFACT CALCULATOR

Pepe was spotted in the Rogue Order Hall in Legion but that wasn't enough! With Transmog Collections coming in Legion, Pepe has collected another round of costumes so he's ready to sit on your head in style for the expansion. The best part? (Item #138461) is an artifact in Legion and you'll be able to spend spare Artifact Power on traits for costumes. The starting trait, (Spell #215530), will even add Pepe to your own Order Hall!

(Item #138461) has been added to the Artifact Calculator; click here to spec out your costume path.

Pepe's new costumes span a variety of themes, including nods to other Blizzard games:


 * (Spell #215513): When summoned, Pepe will sometimes be dressed like Ganymede, Bastion's friend.
 * (Spell #215516): When summoned, Pepe will sometimes be dressed like a nobile Highlord.
 * (Spell #215510): When summoned, Pepe will sometimes be dressed like a Firelord.

 * (Spell #215518): When summoned, Pepe will sometimes be dressed like a minion of N'Zoth.

 
Garrison Bonfire Bonanza Many players have been curious what will happen to our Garrisons in Legion. Will we hand them off to our most trusted follower, or will the Garrison suffer an attack? The mission (Mission #826) offers some answers. Your Garrison is set on fire and your followers celebrate before making their great escape by...what else? Completing a mission. Your followers go up against the Shipyard, Mine, and Salvage Yard--while the Shipyard comes with naval threats they can't counter, their escape will be successful as the start chance is at 100%.UNIQUE EVENTS

A number of one-time-only World Events have occurred throughout the game's history. Most of these events have either directly resulted in changes to the game world or were pre-cursors to expansion packs. They are distinguished from removed content by the fact that they were planned to last only a short time after release (at most one major patch) rather than being removed due to either considerations for new content or gameplay concerns, updates, and other fixes. Note that simply being introduced and removed quickly (e.g. a quest added in patch 3.3.5 and removed for The Shattering) does not qualify something as a One-Time Event or part of one - it must be related to a unique period or occasion.


 * Diablo's 20th Anniversary — Celebrates the 20th anniversary of the Diablo franchise.


 * Legion Invasion — Taking place with Patch 7.0.3, this world event preceded the release of Legion. The event featured the invasion of Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms by forces of the Burning Legion. It was also the first pre-launch event in which characters as low as level 10 could participate in defending affected zones, thanks to new tech allowing mob level to scale to the player's.


 * World of Warcraft 10th Anniversary — Tarren Mill vs Southshore and Level 100 Molten Core.
 * Iron Horde Incursion — Taking place with Patch 6.0.2, this unique world event preceded the release of Warlords of Draenor. The event featured orcs coming through the Dark Portal, ravaging the Blasted Lands and taking over Blackrock Mountain.[2] An extensive quest line saw players battling the Iron Horde invaders in a phased, level-90 only version of the Blasted Lands.


 * Battlefield: Barrens — Taking place in Patch 5.3.0, this event transformed the Northern Barrens, introducing hundreds of new NPCs, new areas and a number of dynamic events, along with a range of rewards for participation. Focusing on the building conflict between Garrosh Hellscream and his loyal Kor'kron and the rebelling forces of Vol'jin's Darkspear Rebellion, adventurers from both the Horde and the Alliance were able to assist the rebels in their preparations for the coming war against the warchief. Players secured supplies for the rebellion by defeating Kor'kron units and their powerful commanders, escorting their faction's supply caravans through the zone and even stealing supplies from overturned Kor'kron caravans.


 * Elemental Unrest — Beginning on 11 November 2010, this event is the precursor to the devastating events of the Cataclysm expansion.


 * Operation: Gnomeregan and Zalazane's Fall — Beginning on 7 September 2010, these world events were the first precursors to the Cataclysm expansion and allowed Alliance and Horde players to assist in the retaking of Gnomeregan's surface and the Echo Isles respectively.
 * Zombie Infestation‎ — Introduced in Patch 3.0.2, this world event was a precursor to the Wrath of the Lich King expansion and featured plagued crates that would transform players into zombies with the ability to pass the zombie plague onto others. It was followed by a reprise of the Scourge Invasion world event from Patch 1.11.0.


 * The Spirit of Competition — This event occurred simultaneously with the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, and simply rewarded players for completing battlegrounds during the event.


 * Battle for Sun's Reach — Introduced in Patch 2.4.0, this world event occurs once per server and requires the completion of a number of daily quests on the Isle of Quel'Danas in order to allow the Shattered Sun Offensive to take over and rebuild the town of Sun's Reach.


 * The Dark Portal Opens — Introduced in Patch 2.0.1, this world event was a precursor to the Burning Crusade expansion and featured the forces of the Horde, Alliance, and Argent Dawn fighting back against the demonic legions entering Azeroth through the Dark Portal.


 * The Scourge Invasion — Originally introduced in Patch 1.11.0, this world event involved an invasion of Scourge forces across the world to coincide with the release of the Naxxramas raid instance. During the invasion, several regions of Azeroth came under attack by Scourge forces. Members of the Argent Dawn organized a worldwide counter to the Scourge invasion, keeping an eye out for any necropolis sightings and passing on their information to all adventurers willing to aid them in their struggle.


 * Gates of Ahn'Qiraj — Introduced in Patch 1.9.0, this two-part world event occurred once per server (until Patch 3.2.0) resulted in the opening of Ahn'Qiraj. It was comprised of a quest chain completed by a single player to obtain the Scepter of the Shifting Sands to open the gates themselves, as well as a server-wide war effort to gather materials for the Horde and Alliance to battle the insectoid menace that issued forth from the opened gates.
