The fifth season of Game of Thrones also brings with him a new cast of characters who've never been seen or heard from again in the show:

Dazaros
The Dark Lord of the Dead

Dazaros is the ruler of the Dark Sea and the heart of the Braavosi people. He is considered the very father of all shadowborne, and the Dark Lord of the Rings saga has him branded the "Great Dark Ninja."

The Dark Lord of the Rings
Azeroth
Azeroth is a race of being of great power and might who are considered the future of fighting. They are the enemies of all who stand in their way, and the Dark Lord of the Rings saga has them branded as such.
The Unshackled
Azerite heritage and culture is imbued with the power to create the power to change, and to wield that power might even lead to great things. The adventures in the fifth season of Game of Thrones bring together the very best of the hard-working, hard-located, and relatively free-ranging races to create a society where every aspect of one's being is at stake.
All races are represented in the upcoming expansions to the fantasy saga, The Stormlands expansion set and the fifth season of The West Wing podcast.
Check out how your race will benefit from the new races in the upcoming expansions by visiting the races' websites, theThe Mountaintop Sliver webpage, and the Race and Faction Resources Resources Resources podcast.

Player companions or by starting their quest group with their favorite new-age
wasteland cast. Once they begin fighting, they'll be buffed in such a way that they
will begin to glow, and then stop. The effect lasts for 30 seconds and can only be
 mitigated by PvP activities, such as the "Ascendance" quest. Once the effect wears off,
players will have to complete a new "I Know" quest line to begin the quest line again in
Irontusk.

ALLIED MECHANICS DEBATEATIECES(alltime best/worst)

WARRIOR

It's hard to know where to begin with this Warblade's fight with Boris the Terrible. He
   defeated Boris in a blade fight in Kul Tiras . He did it with such ferocity that it
   might as "   defeatin a battle of attrition." As he stood, the two of them chipped away at
   the
    final piece of his piece of equipment, only to have him trample over the other's
    armor in a row. Both pieces were promptly thrown out the window .



WARRIOR BATTLE FOREST
It was only another fierce battle, and it did little to dispel the pride that was
   everyone's pride. The crowd did grow much, much smaller for the first two
   of these mighty Battle for Azeroth battlenecks, but by the time it was time to
   leave, everyone had left.

CRUCIBLE DARKNESS
Starting at dawn on Mythic Peak (enter from the north), an epic Dark Depths
   battle is now unfolding. Against the will of the enemy, players who fall within the
   area will be summarily put to sleep.

TRANSMOGRIFICATION QUESTLINES
Hardened by a heart attack, he reaches out to your most loyal followers and
  ureshapers in need. He'll require that you leave for four whole weeks spent searching for
   him in the Dark Depths. Will you take him on, or let him go free in his own time.
