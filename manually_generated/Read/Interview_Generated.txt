           * Before we talk about tomorrow's content update, there's a quick note about our plans for the future. Our biggest complaint with Warlords of Draenor so far has been that it felt like a 'starter' expansion instead of a full 3-part content package. Part of what makes Warlords of Draenor unique is that it's not a typical 'starter' for a MMORPG. That being said, we still like that there's a chance for new players to stumble upon the game during this early access period, so that we can get feedback on how the expansion plays out during its duration.

       * While you and other raid leaders prepare for battle, gather materials, and craft powerful new items, you'll occasionally have the opportunity to interact with an unseen benefactor.
       * All of the sudden, you'll be able to walk through the world and not be attacked by everything? Really?!
       * The level of the raid will be different based on the difficulty of the boss (listed at the top of the page).
       * The random element of the Veldt puzzle will allow you to test your mettle against an unknown foe.
       * The Veldt puzzle will now award different amounts of reputation depending on your score at the end of the dungeon.
       * On the eighth floor, you'll unlock the Veldt Puzzle, an additional dungeon for Blackwing Lair.

A: I've been playing video games, actually. I mean, I've been playing World of Warcraft all weekend long.

Q: Do you have any plans for an expansion to Mists of Pandaria?

A: No, no plans. That'd be kind of weird.

Q: Any plans for a biopic on Martin Luther King?

A: Oh my god no. I mean, I guess there's always the possibility, but we're not entirely sure what that would actually entail.

Q: Any updates on the Broken Shore raid?

A: Well, we're not entirely sure what's been going on with the Broken Shore, but it's been bugging us ever since Sean Murray showed up at Blizzcon that it's a whole lot better now.

Q: Any plans for an expansion to Serpentshrine Caverns?

A: We've been hard at work on that, but it may not be ready for prime time just yet.

Q: Do you have any plans for an expansion to Stygian Depths?

Q: Do you have any plans for an expansion to Blackfathom Deeps?

A: We're not entirely sure what the hell Akkiris Ambushers are, but at least they're not Titans.

*Note: all questions were removed due to the FAQ being so damn dense.

RACES: GENERAL

 * Orc and troll shamans now have their own distinct "tradewalk" ability.
 * Racial Attribute Bonuses: These bonuses have been recalibrated to even out the amount of starting health on the various races, and have been adjusted so that all races start with a standardized level of stamina.

      ITEMIZATION
      
       * All magic item enhancements gained from item enhancements, sockets, and materials in the game have been applied to this new Tanking Tradition.
       * All item enhancements on this list have been approved by the item's creator (Champion's Coin or Incanter's Coin), but not yet implemented in-game. If an item enhancement is implemented in-game, it will show up in the Currency tab of the Character Sheet as soon as it is learned.

Christie Golden: Thank you! I'm sorry, I can't offer much insight into the game design process other than to say that it was very well-received. However, I can offer some insight into why we're doing this in the first place.
   
   
    * Over the years we've added significantly more new spells and abilities to the game than we've removed. The vast majority of those that have been integrated into the game are still there (some for free, some for a small fee).
   
   
   
 * Additionally, every class has an extensive list of available spell books that can be purchased from the class trainer. Many of those spells and abilities will be familiar from previous expansions.
 * Many players have asked for more randomization in Raid design. We've taken an extensive look at all available randomization methods, and find that none of them really add up. We've chosen to use a simple, yet effective random number generator (like the Random Dungeon feature in the Battlegrounds) to provide players with a sense of randomness, instead of having to guess which spells are coming from a random book.
 * Due to the random nature of many of the game's systems, including the advancement of technology, there may be hidden bonuses or changes that will make a particular dungeon experience more random than intended. We try to set as few exceptions as possible, but if it doesn't meet your needs, please don't hesitate to ask.
   
   
 * Dungeons now have a small chance to reward specific items from specific sources.
 * Randomized Battlegrounds
    * As part of our continued efforts to randomize the Battleground system, each time an Arena team chooses to use an Arena Random Battleground, they also randomly select the next Battleground.
   
   
 * Randomized Battlegrounds
    * No longer will randomize Battlegrounds using the Random Dungeon feature. Arena Random Battlegrounds will continue to be performed based on the same criteria used for Random Dungeon.
    * In addition to using the Random Dungeon option, players also have the option to queue for any of the available Random Battlegrounds by entering the random Battleground selection form.
       * Randomized Battleground queues will not randomly select any Battlegrounds. If selected, players will be randomly placed into either
