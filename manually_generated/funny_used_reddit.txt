ALL-NEW CREATURES


We're adding new and exciting creatures to the world, and we're making them better than ever before.

Stormwind Venture Company. Players will find this floating in the heart of the sprawl a peaceful
place where everyone who visits will have a chance of meeting a Stormwind
Venture Company officer or a Winterfall Venture Company officer.

      DRUID
     ABILITY PRUNING
     
     See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning
      class abilities. For Druids, pruning focused on removing redundant niche
      abilities, removing niche abilities that didn't make sense or needed a
      new or better or better use ability, and removing niche abilities
    
      * Fixed a bug that prevented some creatures in Dire Bear Form from appearing in
        Bears.
        
      * Fixed a bug that caused a number of weapon animations in Cat and
        Bear Form to appear larger than they actually were.

          *  [Swipe] now requires the Druid to be in an Arena, but still
             does not stack with other abilities that require that ability
              to have it counted as a base ability. In addition, the
              Swipe now does damage based on the number of players in the
               Arena.
               
               
       * Characters that have earned the Elite Mount achievement can now access the

         achievement will have access to a weekly quest line to accept daily

To be clear, there is no real magic to the Warlock's spells. In fact, most spells that used to benefit you from the spellbook have been turned off by default.
This means that spells that you cast while you are outside of the caster's area of effect will no
         effect you unless you are in combat.
       * Voidwalker's Call 
         * Removed from the game.

           the level-90 Talent row. This new talent replaces the Voidwalker's
           Call talent, and summons a Voidwalker to join your party.
         * The Warlock's Call talent row has been removed and will now only be
           available to the Warlocks. The Warlock's Call talent is now available to all
           Warlock talent rows, and will create a Soulstone on the target to assist

             maps with the same tooltips.
          * Dungeons created using this new feature will now provide a detailed
            description of what each of the dungeons are comprised of.

unique class icon.

NEW HEROES

The Dark Knight is back! You have met your untimely end as
a Dark Knight with a mission to bring balance to the chaotic world of Karazhan.


PVP
       

One of the most problematic aspects of the new PVP rules is the way in which these rules are being applied.
Many players were unsure of the effect the changes to the PVP rules had on
rules such as the Drunkenness, Drunkenness, and Dampenness rules. We did a comprehensive
search of the PVP rules, and came up with four new rules that should be a
comprehensive set of changes to the older Drunkenness, Dampenness, and
Dancing and Jogging rules. These rules are being applied to all types of
intoxication. Several of the older Drunkenness, Dampenness, and Dance
rules have been re-evaluated, and many others have been adjusted. All of these
rules will no longer be applied to [Vitality], [Pleasance], or [Frost Dance] Rogues.

    Quality of life 
    
In the past, we've seen players try to apply the same logic and limitations of the old method of leveling as much as possible, while preserving their happiness and enjoyment outside of Arenas.
This philosophy has proven to be extremely frustrating for many players, as well as for us. We decided to significantly reduce the amount of
one-time quests that we perform in order to allow Forgemaster Rainseeker to remain on his
quality-controlled account.
