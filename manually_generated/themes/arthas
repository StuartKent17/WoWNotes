The Iron Horde invasion of Kalimdor has already begun. As war breaks out across Draenor, many heroes find themselves thrust into the middle of an epic new conflict. But the heroes of Darkshore are not your enemies. Ranks 1-3 of the War for Darkshore raid content are pre-made groups meant to provide an introduction to the raid before jumping into any given boss encounter.


In Darkshore, Arthas and Azeroth are now represented by emblems crafted by Inventors Tyler and Ryan Skiles. These new vendors will craft team-colored versions of the standard issue battle pets for your race.
