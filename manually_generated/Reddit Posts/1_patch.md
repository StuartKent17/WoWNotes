Ok so a long time project I've wanted to do is to use machine learning to spit out some generated patch notes. I finally got around some issues I was having getting started (nerd stuff at end of post). And these are really rough, but there are still some good results. I'm going to change spacing/punctuation, but otherwise leave it as is.

*edit: I've started posting new ones to https://twitter.com/BotPatch*

This is using the smallest dataset, for a small amount of time, and tbh I have no idea what I'm doing. But it might help other people get started, or at least give people some laughs. There's quite high signal to noise at the moment but ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

Training data wise I've only given it 7.\* and 8.\* patches. Raw output link at the end to see how much I filtered out.

There's a subreddit /r/SubSimulatorGPT2, that has a bunch of these generators chatting. Check it out!
