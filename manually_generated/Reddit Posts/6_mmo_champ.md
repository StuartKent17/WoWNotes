*mmo-champion.com amazingly let me grab their archive and feed it into GPT-2 along with my collection of patch notes. Unwittingly this has given me the much sought after ability to generate infinite "tweets from the blues". (Maybe) enjoy.*

# Developer Q&A

**Q: What do you think is the biggest challenge for a class in a raid?**

A: We like the idea of the tanking class, and we think it's a cool concept. It's not a problem we're solving, but we are working on it.

&#x200B;

**Q: What do you think is the biggest challenge for a character in the early stages of a level 90 character?**

A: We don't have any specific examples to share just yet, but we would like to share some of the reasons why we feel that certain skills and talents are less popular than others.

For example, talent specialization is a big part of the reason why we're not doing a "holy paladin" spec. We like to keep it as a choice, but we think it makes the game feel more like a lot of "holy paladin" players are still going to want to do the class. The class specialization system we're working on is a big part of that, and we like the way it feels. It's a cool idea, but it's one that we're not sure we're ready to commit to.

We do like the idea of specialization. It's an interesting idea, but it's one that doesn't fit the gameplay we want to have. It's something that we're constantly looking at, but it's one that isn't as easy as just throwing in a bunch of talents. We have some ideas that are coming up for how we'd like to make that happen, but they're not finished, and we're still working on it.

*Classes*

**Well we're doing a lot of things wrong. Maybe we can fix it, maybe we can't fix it.**I think it's important to keep in mind that we're trying to fix it, but it's hard to do that in a way that doesn't make things worse. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**why not nerf Feral Shaman's taming in 10% dps to compensate for the lack of taming talent?**We don't think it's a big deal. We think it's a really fun ability. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Are we going to see a new talent for Shapeshift in WoD?**That's a cool idea. We just need to figure out how to make it fit. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Why is it that hunters are still able to do all their damage while tanking?**Because they're a lot more fun in PvP. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**I hate the way Hunter dps is too high. I like it when it is high, but I think it's a problem when it's low.**We have some ideas on how to fix that. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**How would you fix the Hunter dps problem?**It's not like we're going to make it the same way every spec. We're not going to do that, but we would like to make some changes. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**any plans to make Misdirection a buff in the future? I'm getting the feeling that it's just a bug now**It's a bug. It's just a fun one.

I'm not sure we're in a position to be able to give you any more details on that. We're still discussing. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**What's the difference between the 2 new Blackout Kick, it's still a stupid ability**It's a dumb ability. We're trying to get to the point where we don't need it. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Can you give us a hint as to when we can expect to see the new Shaman spell, Wild Mushroom?**It's in the game files. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**I can't imagine you guys are happy with the nerf to Shadow. I have always found it fun.**We don't think it was a great design. It was a mistake. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Why do the Druids get a nerf in the expansion? I love the flavor.**The flavor is great. It's just that it's just not in the game. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

&#x200B;

*Characters / Items*

**What's the point of the crafting system? I'd hate to be a slave to it.**I'd hate to be a slave to it. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**The new models are very nice. It's just a shame they're all just so boring.**We love the new models, but they just don't fit the game. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Can we get any more details on the new leveling system?**It's a leveling system. It'll be much easier to work with. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Will the new leveling system work on player level 100+ or will it be mandatory?**Both. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**With the new leveling system, what will we be able to earn?**You'll be able to earn a level 100+ character for free. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Why is the leveling system being removed from the game?**Because we don't think it's a good way for the game to have to constantly adjust and change to keep pace with player activity. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Can we get a sense of how often people use the leveling system to level their characters?**It's not a huge chunk of people, but it's definitely something that we're trying to increase. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

&#x200B;

*Game*

**Why are the new players always complaining about the old way of doing things?**Because it's not the way they wanted to do it.[@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Why does it take so much effort to make a new race?**Because we want them to be a viable choice. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**I'm a level 90, and I can't just type the numbers. I'm using my laptop. Is this the first time we see it?**Yes, it's the first time we see it. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Any chance of a "quality of life" button for Mists of Pandaria? It feels like it would be annoying to have to constantly have to re-adjust your stats to fit the new model.**We are considering it, but it's a tough decision. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Will the next tier of the PTR be a little bit more competitive with the previous tier? Because we're spending so much money on it**Definitely. The current tier is in a pretty good place. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

&#x200B;

*Story*

**Will we see more of the old shaman in the future?**Yes. WarcraftDevs

**Is the War Campaign a way to make the faction feel more unique?**It is. But if you're going to make it, we'd like to make it a bit more. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**'Curse of Naxxramas' Why are we doing this?**I don't think it's fair to give everyone a choice in what to do, it's a challenge. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**The new difficulty is not a reflection of the quality of the content.**It is. It's not the content. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**If you're still doing the content, why not put more in-depth content in the next expansion?**The new content is going to be a ton of fun and I'd love to do more. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

*PVP*

**We're always interested to hear feedback about PvP. It's the reason why we don't have a lot of it in the game. We have a lot of ideas we are working on but we don't have anything ready to share just yet.** [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**PvP So you are trying to convince me that when I win a PVP match that I am "playing the wrong game"?**I'd like to hear the players' perspective. I'm a part of a guild that supports PvP. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**PvE I don't think the berserk bug is that big of a deal, but I am a big fan of the way it is used to justify the badness of PvP.**It's a bug that's been fixed for the past few weeks. We're just going to roll it out to all of the PVP queues in the future. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Will the new PvP system be a completely new system or will it still use the old ones?**The old ones. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Will PvP be reduced to a 3v3 arena style or will it still be a 2v2 style?**The old PvP system was designed to be a different style, so we're still tweaking it. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)

**Any chance of making the PvP gear available in the PvP tabard like the other pieces of gear?**It seems to be a bit overpowered. We're not trying to make PvP gear in the tabard. [@RoboDevs](https://twitter.com/robodevs)
