I have mostly only filtered, rearranged and merged relevant sections, there is a lot of signal to noise, but sometimes it just gets it perfect. Still figuring this out.*

# World of Warcraft: Patch 8.2.5

* Players will no longer start the game with a horse.
* The World of Warcraft: Cataclysm cinematic trailer has been added to the game.
* The Cataclysm world event dungeon achievement " \[Abandoned Assets\]" now requires that the character's last boss be from the Cataclysm world event dungeon.

# General

* The Honor and Victory Conditions for each race/class for Warlords of Draenor have been reduced to 1.
* The level cap for Horde players has been increased to level 110.
* The level cap for Alliance players has been increased to level 110.
* The level cap for Night Elves has been increased to level 150.

We now have the time to address some issues that cropped up during the pre-Mists of Pandaria transition. In Patch 8.2.5a, we had the opportunity to add some additional Azerite power to the game, and in doing so, inadvertently added some additional complexity to the game. The intent with this change was to add additional layers of defense against potential Blizzard DDoS attacks. Unfortunately, the result was undesirable. We chose to add these powers in a way that mitigates the complexity by providing a more intuitive, but also secure, way to do battle.

In order to achieve this, we decided to remove the ability for raid bosses to benefit from Azerite powers. This left us with the option to add another layer of defense against Blizzard DDoS attacks.

* Additional layers of defense can be easily obtained by mixing and matching raid items with each other. However, it is extremely difficult to do so, and we don't think it's a fun business.

# User Interface

* In the game world, the world map has been divided into 4 main sections: North, South, East, and West.
* The mini-map has been split into 4 mini-panes: a minifigure world area, a flying over world, a world view, and a world map panes.
* A new option to display player health/damage has been added to the Game Menu. This option can be found in the top right corner of the Game Menu.
* A new option to display players rating/guild reputation has been added to the Game Menu. This option can be found in the top right corner of the Game Menu.
* The guild interface has been changed to a Guild View. Players can now access this view while mounted, sitting, or in any other position.
* Players will now be able to browse the world map while sitting, or in any other position.

# New Mounts

The new mounts have been added to all three Battlegrounds. Each mount will allow you to mount three different variant classes: Hunter, Monk and Warrior.

**Hunter Mount**

* The hunter's signature hunting rifle has been replaced with a tranquilizer dart.

**Monk Mount**

* The monk's tranquilizer dart has been replaced with a tranquillizer gas.

**Warrior Mount**

* The warrior's tranquilizer dart has been replaced with a shockwave.

# Raid finder

We also made a few adjustments to how Raid Finder difficulty is now set. The first is to adjust the difficulty of Raid Finder so that it does a better job of balancing the number of possible wins. This should provide a smoother and more balanced experience for both casual and hardcore players.

# New Raid: "The Mechanar" -- Battle Of Mechanar

As the war continues across the sea, Prince Erazmin and his loyal Mechormasters are making their way to Mecharon. To stop the war, the Mechormasters have sent a squad of Mechwarriors to invade Mecharon and destroy all that stands in their path!

But even though they are well aware of the Mechromancer threat, the Mechormasters are not talking.

* Mechromancer Mech-Aliens are now immune to Static Shock and will attack their target even when they are stunned.

# Support the Koda

Help the Alliance and the Horde fight the Kodo again! Every hour on A \[New Year's\] Day, you can unlock the ability to enter the Kodo War Room, where you'll take on the role of the Kodo.

This is an Open-Ended, Non-Recurring, Quest-Driven, and Quest-Based Quest, with a core group of characters that you'll build into your party, guild, or any other group. Level 1 characters start out at level 10. Level 2 through 5 characters level up to level 20, and level 6 through 8 become level 30. Level 9 through 12 become level 40, and level 13 through 16 become level 50.

We're planning on adding new quests in future patches, and new rewards in future patches.

    "This is a non-compulsory quest. If you don't have the [Atonement], you don't have the [Atonement]." â€”Gwyn, Priestess of the Wind
    
    The Atonement was a raid reward that was required for completion of the quest.
