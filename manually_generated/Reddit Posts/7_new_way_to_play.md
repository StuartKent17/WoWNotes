A NEW WAY TO PLAY

* Join a duel with players from different realms! You can find the duel option in the interface or by clicking on the 'Play' button.
* Once a duel has started, players can either leave the server or pick a random player to duel.
* The current duel player receives a debuff that will prevent him or her from using abilities for 3 seconds.
* A new debuff will prevent the next melee attack from being able to be dodged or parried.
* The current duel player receives a debuff that will prevent a heal from being used

The server will try to reunite players at the start of a duel. If not possible, players will be given a time to try to get back into the server. Once a player is in the server, players will have 10 seconds to rejoin the duel. If they cannot, the server will try to find another player to fight for them.

Should a player be in the server and unable to fight, the party leader will get a ring notification indicating that the player is stuck in a duel.

* If a player is in a duel and tries to leave, the server will look for a player who can give up a duel to a player who can not, and automatically assume that the player is stuck.
* The server will try to establish a duel by asking the party, "Who are you fighting?" Players will get a choice of responses: "None," "Myself," "Someone else," and "I'm stuck." Players will get a shout-out if they are "In A Queue."
* The server will use the best available information to determine who has the upper hand.

Upon entering a queue, players will be given the option to enter the duel "Local Leader."

* If Local Leader is selected, players will be given a choice of whether to engage the other player in

A NEW WAY TO PLAY

&#x200B;

After months of work, World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth is now available to test your combat abilities. PvP elements will remain unchanged while the core game system is improved.

In this new test, you'll fight against other players from around the world. We want to make sure that the PvP gameplay you have in mind is for the core game, and not in the expansion. We've been hard at work polishing up the core systems, adding new features, and tuning in all the best PvP moments.

Stay tuned for an expansion full of new battles and adventures!

&#x200B;

NEW WORLD BOSSES

In a new, and very limited, way, you can face off against other players from around the world. You'll be matched up against one another, against a computer simulation of the battle, for a limited period of time. During this period, you'll gain experience and gold based on your performance, both in PvP and PvE.

You can then ask to be removed from the simulation, and leave the game. We hope this new and exciting direction for the game takes us by surprise. Stay tuned for an expansion full of new battles and adventures!

NEW CHARACTER MODELS

The models for the races from the original game (white, paladin, etc.), along with a few others, have been changed to be more in keeping with the expansion's theme. The main change here is that the skins have been changed. Instead of having standard class skins, which were very limited in their ability to be fun, players now have the opportunity to choose from a larger selection of class skins. Additionally, we've buffed and clarified a few core concepts. Overall, this brings the amount of customization available to the game up to a level that the expansion felt like a premium product.

All of the above applies to the regular Forsaken, Druids, and Balance druids. You'll retain your existing 15% spell power (which we did not intend), and the new flavor will be available to Experiment (as intended) with.

In the meantime, we wanted to make sure players understood the reasoning for the change to class-specific skins. After all, these skins have been chosen primarily for their aesthetic appeal. Furthermore, we've seen players complain about the difficulty of gaining Trueheart in Season 3 (before the Patch 7.1 changes), so we decided to take matters into our own hands and make changes to the game for the expansion.

&#x200B;

PVP

Stranglethorn Vale has received several significant changes.

* All characters on a realm have the option to participate in PvP.
* Each character has the following abilities:
   * Attack power
   * Cast animation
   * Dodge and Parry
   * Weapon damage
   * Healing and self-sustain

*This collection of nonsense was generated by one of the more advanced text 'generators' currently available. Trained on a huge number of web pages it will introduce ideas not found in the source material so the output is always somewhat novel (Fine-tuning material is every single X.X patch note ever, april fools patch notes, some fan-generated expansions and amazingly the entire news history from MMO-Champion.com).*

*I have a github* repo *that I can share that has all the training data, most of the generated data, and a shortlist from the insanity.*
