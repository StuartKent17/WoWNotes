      INVENTORY IMPROVEMENTS
      
      Over the years, we've added over 50 new recipes to the inventories of the various factions. Unfortunately, many of these new recipes were in places we hadn't previously checked. After much internal deliberation, we've decided to make these new recipes available to everyone. If you've discovered a new recipe, you can pick it up from the inventories of one of the factions in one of the following ways:
      
      
       * By visiting one of the four gateways provided by the various Iron Horde factions (� la [80] Path to Power).
       * By speaking with an NPC in one of the many capital cities (� la [Paradise] or Bank of the Historian).
       * By visiting one of the many NPCs that give quests (� la the "NPCs in the City").
       * By using the Quest Tracker located in the bottom right corner of the mini-map (� la [Find A Grave]).
       * By using the Quick Join system, which is located in the bottom left corner of the mini-map, players can be automatically entered into group chats.
       
       
             NEW QUEST HUB
      
       * A new quest hub has been added to the Stair of Destiny located in the eastern Barrens. You'll be able to queue for Warlords content by visiting the new quest hub.
       * A Warlords quest hub has been added to the Stair of Destiny located in the Eastern Plaguelands.
       * An Inn has been added to the Stair of Destiny for players that are still unable to gain access to the Stormwind or Orgrimmar via the instance portal.
       * All available dungeons and raids are now available via the "D" key. Please note that all dungeons and raids are not available via this channel; all such dungeons and raids will be re-opened with a live server one day after release.
       * Loot from the loading screens of Deadmines, Mistsong, and Terokkar Forest has been moved to the Loot Tab.
       * An "Ammo Slot" has been added to the top of the right-click menu. Ammo will no longer automatically reload into this slot. You can activate this slot by clicking the Ammo Slot icon next to the right side of the action bar.
       * Quest rewards in Alterac Valley for each faction now have a new, unique icon. Quest rewards from earlier Warlords content are still available via this tab.
       * Loot from the loading screens of all raid encounters now has an icon. Previously, only available from raid bosses were hidden in plain sight.
       * A new loading screen has been added to the loading screens of Tears of a Jedi Knight, Wretched Skiver, and The Missing Rogue quest.
       * An "Ammo Slot" has been added to the top
       
       
 Mark of Arthas, a rare quality invitation, has been added to existing Mark of Arthas instances.
DUNGEONS
NEW WORLD BOSSES

Now that Arthas and his men have breached the Dark Portal, the Lich King's forces have
turned the dangerous dungeon into a veritable war zone. With the help of the demon hunters of
Arathi Highlands, the Alliance and Horde have begun scouting the Kun-Lai
and have begun sending reinforcements.




CITIES AND FACTIONS
NEW HIGHEST DUNGEON RAIDING IN THE MACAU


Players who join the Highmant or Highmountain West factions to fight on behalf of Tauren or Horde
will receive a new raid structure: the Highmant, held by the Tauren and Horde.
This raid structure will allow players to form a powerful
monk bond with an NPC ally, and work together to overthrow the current
current ruler of Tauren or Horde. These raids will have weekly and daily bonuses and
tips, and are intended for a variety of raid composition.


The Highmant will be a hub of Tol Barad and Orgrimmar, the capital city of
the Alliance. The Highmountain West faction will extend the Reach and the Eastern Plaguelands
of the Horde in order to provide a foothold for the new raid structure.





RETRIBUTION DUNGEON: THE SHADOW OF THE RAID CONTINUES

The adventures of Prince Kael'thas and the Alliance's finest continue in the Shadow of the
Raids. Collect all the Emperor's finest gear and head to Darrow Downs to claim the
embarkation of your very own Kael'thas.

GENERAL

 * The Shadow is now open for play and the 25 player spawn rate has been
   reduced.
 * The Shadow now has a limited number of daily quests to complete.
 * Creatures in the Shadow now have a chance to drop an item called a Heart of Flame (item
   required for the epic mount quest " [120] Heart of the Storm"). This item can be obtained
   from the following creatures in the Shadow at least once: [Moonkin], 
   [Darkrai Cloth], [Thori'dal, Bludgeon of the Dark Lord], [Darkrai Gore], 
   [Thori'dal Leather], [Thori'dal Weight Belt], [Thori'dal Weight Belt], and 
   [Thori'dal Braid]. The Thori'dal Weight Belt and Darkrai Gore items are rare
   items found in Broken Shore.
 * The Shadow now has a limited number of daily quests to complete.
 * The Shadow now has a chance to drop an item called a [Frostweave Net]. This item can
   be obtained from: [Dalaran Net], [Frostweave Net], [Frostweb Net], [Frostweave
   Net Vest], [Frostweave Net Shoulder Pads], [Frostweave Net Around], [Frostweave
   Vest], [Frostweave Net Underarms], and [Frostweave Net Spines].
 * The Shadow now has a chance to drop an item called a [Gorefiend's Wands]. This
   item can be found in Broken Shore.
 * Mount Abilities
    *  [Farstrider] (Windwalker) now also increases the chance to dodge by 20%.
   *  [Serenity] (Windwalker) now reduces the cooldown of [Serenity].
   *  [Ring of Light] (Windwalker) now increases the duration of [Ring of Light] by 45
     seconds.



     When a player uses an ability that has a visual effect that resembles a cross-section of the torso, they are viewing a representation of the character's torso in 3D space. The player's head is displayed in left field, while the character's hands and feet are displayed in right field.
      
      
      In addition, players can now inspect other characters while viewing a character's torso in 3D space by clicking on the words "Character Name" at the top of the screen, selecting an image, and then dragging it onto the screen.
      
      GUILDS
      
      Guild creation is now in the game, but not quite as it was originally intended to be. Gone are the days when you could create a guild and call it whatever you wanted. You now required a 2-page application to be able to join a guild, and a 3-page application to be able to create a new guild. While we have made some improvements to the guild creation process, it is still not quite as simple as it was.
      
      
      In order to make the guild experience more meaningful, we've made some changes to the guild experience itself. In particular, we've added a third step to becoming a member of a guild, the "Story Step." This third step allows a member of a guild to experience the full value of the experience bonus before deciding to join a guild, by providing a steady stream of bonus rewards for participating in a weekly bonus roll, and offers an incentive to continuing the guild regardless of whether you are a member of the guild or not.
      
      
       * Each week, players will receive a new quest at a random location on the world, requiring them to complete a specific dungeon run in order to receive the "Story Reward" – a hefty 375% bonus to an item's drop rate!
       * The quest can be completed by all players who have attained a rating of Silver or higher in the respective role that week, but only a member of a guild will be eligible to receive the bonus.
       * Completed dungeons will award bonus resources up to a maximum of 375% of the week's cap, with a weekly cap of 10,000 (up from 10,000).
       * Once a player has earned more than one story reward from a specific week during the same period, the player will receive an additional bonus roll for that week's reward.
       * The final bonus roll reward will be based on the final rating of the guild that week, with a minimum cap of 1,000 for each guild.
       * Once a player has earned more than one bonus roll during the same period, the player will receive an additional bonus roll for that week's reward.
      
      FLIGHT PATHS
      
      Flight paths have been added to Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch, and Arathi Basin.
      
      
      Paths are no longer available on the fly from several locations along the Eastern Kingdoms to each of these flight points.
      
      
      Players will now be able to use flight paths that they have discovered along their travels.
      
      
       * Flight Paths 
          * Flight Paths have been added to Ironforge, Darnassus, Orgrimmar, and Thunder Bluff.
          * Flight Paths have been added to Stair of Destiny, Talonbranch, Shattrath, and The Undercity.
          * Flight Paths have been added to Orgrimmar, Stair of Destiny, and Theramore Isle.
          * Flight Paths have been added to Outland, Northrend, and Draenor.
          * Flight Paths have been added to Outland, Northrend, Draenor, and Battle for Azeroth.
          * Flight Paths have been added to Draenor and Eastern Kingdoms.
          * Flight Paths have been added to Stair of Destiny, Talonbranch, Sh




          
Honorable mentions
I know this is going to be a long post, and that it may take some time for everyone to fully absorb all of the above, especially since we're still a very young team, and not many of you have actually seen the game or really been in touch with the people behind the concept. So, here it is, and for those of you who are fortunate enough to be able to take the time to read through the full post, please bear with us: the Tides of Vengeance is a very small but growing team, and will be further expanded upon in future patches.
We'll continue to add to the depth of this out-of-the-box mechanic through the use of the new "Honorable Kills" feature, which gives players the opportunity to earn additional Honor upon earning a certain number of "Honorable Kills" from a given raid or dungeon boss.
Along the way, players will unlock new zones and dungeons, and will gain new titles, titles, and titles. To begin, we want to make it clear that this is not an official launch of Tides of Vengeance, and that there will be no additional changes for those new to the game who try to enter these new zones or dungeons.
The Tides of Vengeance Team
The Tides of Vengeance team is comprised of a full-time Dungeon Finder, an outside dungeon designer, and a dedicated dedicated Tides of Vengeance-related officer and officer's assistants.








In the wake of the terrible events of the War of the Three Hammers, the three factions have declared war on the world. The battle for Azeroth is coming to a head!

The Horde and the Alliance, with the assistance of the Horde's powerful hero, Arthas Menethil, have begun a series of quests to gather resources to help rebuild the ruined world. As these quests progress, they will unlock additional powers to aid their cause, and the quests will become more and more difficult.

Arthas will also help the Horde and the Alliance with their quests, as well as provide new powers to aid them in their cause.

Each time the Horde and the Alliance complete a quest, the quest will become more challenging and you will need to work together to complete it. When it is complete, Arthas will reward you with a piece of loot.

Alliances will also be able to unlock additional abilities for their hero through additional quests.
