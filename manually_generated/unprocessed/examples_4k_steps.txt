 of the warlock's spellbook, and in the next patch you will see a new warlock spell called Empower.
    * Warlock mana regeneration is going to be significantly improved in this patch.
   
   WARRIOR
   
    * Developer's Note: Warlocks are getting really excited about their new Demonology tree and want to share their most recent thoughts. We think that the feedback loop that Warlocks create when they create a new talent that eventually finds its way into your rotation is very exciting!
    * Working through some outstanding talent issues, we have decided to remove or significantly modify the talents that Warlock players are accustomed to. This has led to some frustration for players accustomed to different Warrior loadouts, which we hope to remedy in the next patch.
    * Advocate has been removed from the game.
    * We're thrilled to announce that Gael García Bernal has been added to the cast of Demonology once again! Gael García Bernal will fill a similar role that Honorable mentions will once again fill during the ceremony when Castanas are cast.
    * Warlocks can no longer cast Demoralizing Shout while in the Throne of the Imp. This has been addressed.
    * The Fury specialization has seen a major overhaul.
    * New Ability: Eternal Flame
    * Requires at least 25 Burning Embers. Usable outdoors only. Cooldown will no longer increase as your [Immolate] trait attains higher ranks.
    * Duration has been lowered to 10 seconds.
    * This new talent replaces [Heart of Fire]. It will deal additional damage to targets that are wearing Heart of Fire.
   
   WARRIOR
   
    * We're happy to announce that the talents of the Warrior who truly embody the essence of the Warrior class are now available. The benefits of these talents will vary depending on personal preference, but we feel that the talent tree has evolved enough for players to make meaningful choices at higher skill levels. Please note that the talent tree and class skill levels have not changed. Players will continue to need to select the appropriate talent at level 110 to use these abilities.
    * Currently, only Dual Wield Specialization and the like are available as freestyle combat abilities. To bring them more fully into line with our goals for balanced and well-rounded gameplay, we've added a new ability that all Warriors should already know.
    *  [Deep Wounds] (Rank 1) now does the appropriate damage for the situation. (Rank 2 and 3 not receiving the same bonus this time.)
    *  [Hamstring] (Rank 1) now does the appropriate damage for the situation. (Rank 2 and 3 not receiving the same bonus this time.)
    *  [Deep Wounds] (Rank 1) now does the appropriate damage for the situation. (Rank 2 and 3 not receiving the same bonus this time.)
   
   WARRIOR
   
    * Warrior spells that have a focus component are now able to be cast while moving.
    *  [Disarm] is now usable in front of the target, and will now cause damage to that target if the attack misses or is dodged.
    *  [Shield Bash]'s damage has been reduced to compensate.
    *  [Mortal Strike] now deals damage to the primary target, rather than the secondary. Damage to the secondary target will still be dealt, however, as well as the initial damage.
    *  [Warbringer] now works with armor points. (Previously it did not work with armor.)
    *  [Enrage] now generates 12 Energy over 10 seconds.
    *  [Shield Slam] now hits at least 4 additional targets, has a chance to generate additional energy, and can hit more than one target at once.
    *  [Warbringer] can now be properly credited, and dispelled, even if the Warrior has not attacked anyone.
   
   ITEMS
   
    * Some items were causing additional unintended complexity, and have been reduced or removed as intended.
    * Quests and rewards are now only usable in the Warrior's preferred talent tree.
    * Quests and rewards are no longer usable if the character has been Inspired.
    * Several lootable items from Zul'Gurub have been changed to be more useful for level 60 players.
    * Quests and rewards are no longer usable while stunned.
    * Inspired rage is now usable once per heroic raid.
    * Warlocks can now activate a
