      HOLY CHANGES
      
      We made several changes for Holy, to go along with other larger system changes to compensate for the removal of [Divine Favor], [Divine Shield], and [Divine Fury]. We also needed to replace some cooldowns with new ones, so we took a look at cooldowns that were broken because of Divine Favor and Divine Shield, and considered adding a new one to the mix. We decided to replace Divine Fury with [Divine Guidance], which is less clear cut. We also needed to update some cooldowns to better align with the new system, since they were broken because of Divine Favor and Divine Shield. Holy now has several cooldowns that were redundant and did not use [Divine Fury]. We also needed to update some stances to better support the new system, since they were not used consistently and were therefore removed.

      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Monk ability consolidation is fairly straightforward. It includes merging of some passive abilities, and removal of others.

      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Monks had a few mergers of passive abilities. But overall the intent of most of them is to make them more versatile.
      
      
      One important distinction between Monks and Warriors is that Warriors have weapons, while Monks have mind-blades. That distinction will play a role in deciding which abilities to use and when to use them, but it's not directly related to the difference in attack power. Another important distinction is that Monks use their blades in combat, while Warriors use their swords in passive, defensive modes. In other words, Warriors use their blades in passive modes, while Monks use their blades primarily in offensive modes.
      
      
      Another distinction that will play a role in determining which abilities to use and when to use them is the difference in cooldowns. Generally speaking, the higher the cooldown, the more damage that ability does. So, a Monk using a higher cooldown would do more damage, while a lower cooldown would do more damage with higher attack power.
      
      
      Another distinction that will play a role in

      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      The biggest change here is the merger of Stance of the Fierce Tiger and Stance of the Fierce Tiger monk specializations. This change effectively removed one of the strongest abilities for a Monk, and opened up space for other rotational choices. One of the new abilities available is the Revive Ability, which we're gradually transitioning to in the next patch.
      
      
       *  [Stance of the Fierce Tiger] now provides a 5% increase to healing done (up from 3%), and [Fierce Tiger Palm] now provides 1 Chi each when used, instead of [Chi Burst] (instead of [Chi Mastery: Fierce Spirit]).

====================
For nearly two years, the two organizations representing Falkland Islanders have sat down together in the capital city, at the historic Town Hall, to hammer out a long-overdue settlement: the Faroe Islands.
   
   
 * This site was named for a region in the South Seas, off the coast of Freetown. The Faroe Islands is now officially a part of the Faroe Islands.
 * The Faroe Islands is now home to a new, independent government led by a group of brave men who have taken refuge in the Town Hall.
 * The Town Hall, as it exists on the Faroe Islands, is under siege from an unknown enemy. The Fortress of Stone has been added to the mix of defensive measures.
 * Stonehearth, the new level 80 quest line will be offered to players who are exalted with the Faroe Islands. However, the power of Stonehearth will only be available for players who are not exalted with the Faroe Islands. This means that players who are not exalted with the Faroe Islands will be able to travel to Stonehearth, and those who are exalted with the Faroe Islands will only be able to visit Stonehearth. This will be addressed through a future patch.
   
   
 * Players will no longer be able to fly or use Flying mount abilities from outside the game. In the mean time, players who use Flying mount abilities from within the game will be forced to learn the corresponding flying mount ability from the trainer.
 * The Faroe Islands has been given a name: Stonehearth.
 * Stonehearth is the official name for the Stonehearth faction located in the South Seas.
 * Stonehearth is led by Captain Galvangar.
 * Stonehearth is represented in the Alliance capital by General Vandis.
 * Players will no longer be able to build or purchase buildings unless they join the Faroe Islands faction.
 * The name of the Stonehearth faction currently resides in the Krasarang Wilds. The faction will eventually be changed to Stonehearth.
 * The Stonehearth faction will eventually be changed to Stonehearth if enough players object to the current faction name.
 * The current Stonehearth faction is actually the Second Sight faction. The Second Sight faction was formed when the original faction, Stormcry, reverted to being a healing faction. Therefore, the current Stonehearth faction is not necessarily a part of the "Stonehearth" family.
 * The current Stonehearth faction is not associated with the Stormcry faction at all.
 * The current Stonehearth faction is not associated with any of the major powers in Alterac Valley. Alterac Valley is being redesigned for this reason.
 * The current Stonehearth faction is not associated with the Horde or Alliance either. They are all independent factions with their own storylines. Alterac Valley is being redesigned for this reason.
 * The current Stonehearth faction is not associated with the Scarlet Monastery either. They are all separate from each other.
 * The current Stonehearth faction is not associated with the Ursine Monastery either. They are all separate from each other.
 * The current Stonehearth faction is "Not Found" meaning they have not been unlocked.
 * A faction will be unlocked and immediately removed by a quest. The nearest available faction is the one closest to your faction's name.
 * Quest givers will be notified when a player obtains a quest that will lead to a faction higher up the quest chain. The givers will have a 3 minute cooldown before they will allow players to complete a quest for which they have not been notified.
 * Non-combat pets are now flagged as Humanoid so they can be tapped and pulled towards a player's minimap.
 * A new option has been added under Video Options called Combat Mouse. This mouse option can be accessed by clicking on the Combat Mouse option in the Video Options menu.
 * A new option, Mouse Click to Move, has been added which disables mouse movement.
 * New art textures have been added for the mounts.
 * New art textures have been added for players and mounts.
 * Players will now be able to access the forums by joining as a Guest. In order to use the forums, players must first invite a Player to join the channel.
 * A new feature has been added which allows players to make profession-specific emotes. Emojis can be made using the Emote Builder.
 * A new feature has been added which allows players to make profession-specific emotes more visible. Emotes can be made using the Make Emote ( ) and Set Emote ( ) action buttons.
 * A new feature has been added which allows players to create new emotes more quickly. Emotes can be created with the Add Emote Action Button.
 * A new action bar has been added to the Job Hunter UI which will display
====================
       *  [Nimboya's Secret]: This item's tooltip now indicates it counts as a potion.
       *  [Primordius Incantatem]: The bonus spell damage from this enchantment will now correctly be consumed by casting higher level spells.
       *  [Rune Tap]: This item can now be looted.
       *  [Tome of the Lightbringer]: The tooltip now indicates it counts as a potion.
       *  [Void Crystalforged Treads]: The bonus damage on this item was being consumed when it became bound to skin. It is now bound to skin.
      
      HORDE CHANGES
      
       * Players can no longer accept Horde invites to Horde Dungeons, and we have banned players from entering Horde dungeons (via the Dungeon Finder) in order to improve the experience for everyone involved. It's been a long time coming, but we're finally making some changes.
      
      
       * Horde Dungeons: The rewards have been modified to be more in line with our goals for a PvP experience: Low level, high resource investment. Combat Potency is a bonus passive ability granted by tanks and healers that gives players an advantage in the PvP environment.
       *  [Oil of Immolation]: This item was never intended to be a part of the armor set. We have adjusted the tooltip on this item to better explain its function and how it affects the attack power contribution from tanks.
      
      MAGE
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
       [Arcane Potency] passive is now a passive effect learned by mages at level 10.
       *  [Arcane Blast]: The mana return effect for Arcane Potency is now a shared buff with all other mana regeneration effects.
       *  [Arcane Explosion]: The buff from this ability has been modified to work similar to a warrior talent called "Might of the Frozen Wastes". In addition, Arcane Explosion can no longer trigger "Might of the Frozen Wastes".
       *  [Arcane Missiles]: Some missiles in the game which spent a percentage of their total mana cost on a direct damage component were replaced with a percentage of their total mana cost as a direct damage component. We made that change to reduce the direct damage component and improve the efficiency of our mana regeneration effects.
       *  [Arcane Explosion]: The damage over time component has been removed and will work in a similar manner to a warrior ability called "Might of the Frozen Wastes". In addition, Arcane Explosion can no longer trigger "Might of the Frozen Wastes".
       *  [Arcane Barrage]: Damage over time will no longer cause this ability to trigger and consume up to an additional charge from the Arcane Explosion talent.
       *  [Arcane Blast]: This ability now shares a cooldown with all other mana cost effects.
       *  [Arcane Explosion]: This ability now shares a cooldown with all other mana cost effects.
       *  [Arcane Bomb]: Bomb functionality has been improved and no longer functions like a ranged weapon. It now functions like a melee weapon and has the same range as bows/staves. In addition, a bug caused the damage from this ability to not trigger a global cooldown has been fixed.
       *  [Arcane Torrent]: This ability can now trigger while the mage is sitting.
       *  [Arcane Barrage]: This ability now shares a cooldown with all other mana cost effects.
       *  [Arcane Explosion]: This ability now shares a cooldown with all other mana cost effects.

      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      Some of the passive abilities of priests had redundant components, causing them to be unwieldy. We made several changes to consolidate some of these abilities. Our first change was to reduce the number of priest spell buttons. We did this by merging some of their buttons into their baseline abilities. For [Mind Blast], [Mind Flay], and [Penance], we merged their cooldowns into their effects. For [Divine Fury], [Divine Plea], and [Divine Protection], we merged their button activations with their damage absorption. For [Force of Will], we merged their activation with their damage absorption.

      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For rogues, a couple of abilities were changed to make them more usable. For a closer look at the class abilities pruned, check out this blog: https://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=369&sid=1
      
      
      Also worth noting here is the removal of [Blind] from the game. Blind players have always been removed from the game due to durability, and that continued with the patch. We removed durability and buffed damage with abilities to try and encourage players to use them.
      
      
      Finally, we removed the [Elixir of Water] from the game. We felt that the elixir was a necessary evil, and so it was removed. Players complained about the elixir's placement in the game, and so we decided to remove it. Players will now have to find the elixir to gain its benefit, and so we decided to place a new item in the Alchemy Lab to compensate.

      HORDE CHANGES
      
      We made several changes for Horde. One was to bring the damage of Treant Protector up to a more reasonable level, to balance it with the damage of the other two main Treant classes (Guardian and Moonkin). The other was to remove the defensive buff that Tiger Stance provided, as it was giving the wrong damage range to both Guardian and Moonkin, and also to fix a bug with its activation where it was not being reapplied correctly. We also needed to resolve a bug where Colossus Smash could miss, due to its non-Guardian nature, and fix a bug where Colossus Shrink could not be activated. Finally, we needed to fix an issue where War Stomp was not generating the intended aggro, due to targeting reticules not matching the intended for the fight.
      
      
       *  [Rend] now generates 16% more threat.
       *  [Incarnation: Tree of Life] now provides 20% more threat.
       *  [Tiger's Lust] is now also triggered by auto-attacks, though it only affects the character that is actually attacking the monster.
       *  [Warlord's Command] now has a 10% chance to activate, was an 8% chance.
      
      
      That brings us to the present. We're very proud of the Guardian and the Moonkin, and we hope that you are as well. However, there are some problems with both the Guardian and the Moonkin that we needed to solve. The most obvious one is that the Moonkin does not have the stamina to fight in full health (they have to eat, drink, and sleep to recover). Additionally, the Moonkin has no arms, so we had to find a way to make them eat and breathe. We solved this problem by having the Moonkin's right arm become the right arm of the Guardian. This solution solved both problems, but it still left the Guardian with one arm. This was a very difficult problem to solve, because the Moonkin already has the right arm, so we knew it would be better to just kill the right arm off. Unfortunately, this solution did not solve the problem, because the problem with eating and breathing was already solved by that point. We decided to kill the right arm off, because we do not have any other options. The problem with eating and breathing is that it is not handled correctly. All of the abilities that deal damage with food and drink are not handled correctly either. This leads to situations where you are sitting, and your character does not move. You are supposed to be able to eat and drink, yet you are not able

====================
The Darkspear Trolls have always been a popular choice for warlocks due to their fast paced and strategic nature. In Patch 7.1.2, the Trolls were replaced with the Gallows Trolls, who hail from the Eastern Plaguelands. The Darkspear Trolls have a long history with the Eastern Plaguelands, and are a proud clan. Their leader, Gallows, is a Troll from the Eastern Plaguelands. Their leader, Warlocks, are also from the Eastern Plaguelands. Both Warlocks and Trolls have a long history with the Eastern Plaguelands, and have always fought for the clan.


In the war against the Demons, the Trolls were extremely helpful in the battle for Hallow's End. Their leader, Gallows, is also the clan warlock known as "the Dragon" due to his mystical powers. After the war against the Demons, Warlocks and Trolls returned to their homeland, where they continue their war against the Horde.


Patch 7.1.2 includes the first playable Warlocks and Trolls, alongside the Gallows Trolls. The Patch 7.1.2 cinematic is narrated by a female Troll.


The Patch 7.1.2 cinematic is considered a pre-release patch, and was written by a player prior to the official announcement. The cinematic highlights the changes with art by Nefarian. The music composed by Jaime Ayala is primarily instrumental. The Patch 7.1.2 cinematic is considered a placeholder for the expansion, and is not part of the official expansion roadmap.

Targeted spells cast by a rogue will now be more likely to be dodged by their target. This is to prevent the player from simply zoning into the area and spamming the dodge key with no regard for the fact that their target will be using that key to dodge the dodge. The rogue has been specially trained in order to avoid using dodge abilities where possible.

Mana Feed: When the Priest casts [Vampiric Touch] on a target, the cast time of [Heal] is added into the equation with the Vampiric Touch heal. This is the primary source of contention between the two talents. The talent [Vampiric Touch] is intended to be used in conjunction with [Contrition] in order to greatly increase the healing of the [Vampiric Touch] talent. Contrition currently does not work with Vampiric Touch.

      ABILITY CONSOLIDATION AND REFINEMENT
      
      The most difficult abilities to balance in the game had a large number of redundant abilities that did little or nothing for your survivability. We decided to merge these abilities into a single talent tree, rebalance the differences, and add new abilities to each specialization. The Mage specialization has the most ability consolidation, but also the most removal.

          *  [Curse of Recklessness] and [Curse of Tongues] have been removed.

      HORDE CHANGES
      
      The biggest change here is probably the biggest change to Warriors in a long time: the ability to ignore tank buffs. Everyone loves a good tank buff, and it's great to have a group of Warriors who share your love for the game. However, in order to make this a reality we needed to change the core gameplay of Warriors. We've always been about adding gameplay depth to the game, so we're happy with the results. However, there are some situations where that gameplay depth comes at the cost of tank DPS.
      
       [Ravager] is a popular tank ability among newer players, so we wanted to expand the game to include more tanks. However, we also needed to make the talent more viable for lower level Tanks. Our goal with Tank Devastation was to remove the ability for lower level Tanks to just sit back and take damage, and we were successful with that. We've lost some of that depth with the changes to [Ravager], but we've gained some new gameplay depth with the changes to [Wrecking Crew].
      
      
      We also needed to change the playstyle of Warrior [Mortal Strike], because [Slam]'s damage has been reduced by 40% and [Riposte]'s damage has been reduced by 30%. We also needed to change the targeting cone of [Mortal Strike], because that mechanic has always been broken down into different categories. So, we changed Armor Sacks to now have a single category (Destructive Ability) and added a new category (Stunting Ability) to Armor Proficiencies. All of those changes apply to Misdirection as well.
      
      
      Another big change for Warriors is the addition of [Blood

====================
TORONTO – Two prominent figures in the Bitcoin community, Charlie Lee and Charlie Liu, have died at the age of 42.
   
   
 *  [Charlie Lee] – A self-taught programmer by trade, Charlie Lee was tragically killed in a car accident in 2014 while biking through his native South Korea. His death sparked an extensive controversy over the legality of riding through residential streets in his native land.
    *  [Charlie Liu] – A self-taught journalist, Charlie Liu was tragically killed in a car crash in 2014 while bicycling through his native Hong Kong. His death sparked an extensive controversy over the legality of using bicycles in urban areas.
   
   
 * Charlie Lee was known for his outspoken criticism of the Chinese government and outspoken opposition to the Silk Road auction.
    *  [Gavin Andresen] – A self-described "hardcore Bitcoiner" by trade, Gavin Andresen was tragically killed in a mysterious plane crash in Malaysia in 2014. Rumors have since circulated that he may have been involved in the crash.
   
   
 *  [Sean Thompson] – A journalist, photographer, and actor best known for his work as the voice of Kota the Storm in the Warcraft movie series, Sean Thompson passed away last week. He was 42 years old.
    *  [Terrence Hudson] – A self-described "geeky legend" who spent most of his career in the gaming industry, Terrence Hudson was tragically killed last week in a plane crash in San Francisco Bay. He was 32 years old.
    *  [Cambridge Astronomer] – A self-described "brilliant young man" who "took astronomy very seriously," Cambridge Astronomer Cambridge was tragically killed last week in a plane crash in Salt Lake City. He was 22 years old.
    *  [Grizzly Bear] – A legendary Swiss Army knife, the Grizzly Bear was once owned by the titular character from the film series. Unfortunately, its current owner is none other than the film's creator, Stanley Kubrick. Grizzly Bear is considered by many to be one of the most dangerous knives ever made.
    *  [Flask of the Legion] – Created by legendary adventurer and gun collector Galgann, the Flask of the Legion is said to be the key to many a man's purse. Unfortunately, since its owner is none other than the film's narrator, we must now assume that Galgann was indeed the main character in the film.
    *  [Kilgore Mageblade] – Originally crafted by the legendary Spellbinders of the Western Plaguelands, the Kilgore Mageblade has become a treasured possession for the Alliance. The Alliance has expressed their fondness for the item and wish to keep it for their own use. We, however, are not entirely sure what to make of this particular dispute.
    *  [The Black Dagger of the Ogre Magi] was made by an unknown artist, however, it has since been given to the Horde. We believe this individual to be the true inspiration behind the legendary hooded mace.
    *  [The Red Whelp Moth] was created by a player who fell on hard times back in Northrend, so we're putting that name on it's rightful owner.
    * Another piece of memorabilia from the game, this time for the class known as "Murlocs," has been added to the game. This new item is available through a series of quests and should be in no way related to the "Red Whelp Moth."
