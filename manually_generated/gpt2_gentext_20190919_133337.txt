      BLOOD CHANGES
      
      Blood type was the determining factor on the decisions Blizzard made in
        the course of their recent Resilience work. In order to properly
        balance the number of health and survivability of their damage
        mitigation, we've taken steps to remove that factor from the game. We
        will be making a Major Resolve patch to address this in a major way,
        reducing the number of points spent on Resilience by the same amount and
        merging it with baseline Resilience. As such, the Blood deathrattle we
        are making now has a smaller number of points to compensate for the
        removal of Resilience. The scaling and diminishing returns of those
        changes will continue to be the focus of the discussion of scaling and diminishing
        returns for different stats.
      
      
       * Blood deathrattlers now start with a healthy amount of health, but will burn more
         health per blood point (while in [Resilience]) upon death. This will
         be different for each class, specialization, and tree.
       * Blood deathrattlers will be split into two tiers: The lower tier
         will burn less health per blood point (while in [Blood Protection]) and
         more (while in [Blood Presence).
       * All classes will have more health and rage when [Blood Presence] is active
         (levels 71-80). Both will burn less health per blood point (while
         in [Blood Presence]) and rage (while in [Blood and Brains]) upon
         death.
      
      
       * Death knights now start with roughly 20% of their total health
         (before [Resolve] and [Blood and Brains]) remaining after their [Blood
          Surgency] or [Blood Strike] ability is used. As a general rule,
         all classes will
