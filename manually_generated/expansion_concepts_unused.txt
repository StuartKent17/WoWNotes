World Of Warcraft:  [Forsaken Wastes]

 [Terminus Oculatus]
Chalice Of Fire
Blizzenblitz 


A short time ago we introduced you to the concept of a "turbo charge", whereby a player's powers and abilities temporarily increase in efficiency by applying a small amount of additional damage or healing to an already-existing effect on the target. Today we're introducing you to the concept of a "turbo-honor charge", whereby when demonstrating mastery of a role, your auto-attack hits an additional nearby target for a large damage bonus.

Together, these two changes represent the first step toward what we hope to see in World of Warcraft: instant, automatic, customizable, peer-to-peer damage and healing. While we still have lots of work to do in order to fully realize this vision, we can at least say that it's a start.

EDITOR'S NOTE: This article discusses an ongoing topic within the World of Warcraft development team. We'd like to hear your thoughts on the subject. Please send suggestions to the forum administrator.

In addition to all of the above, there's been a special Halloween event in Stormwind this last weekend that involved trick-or-treating. Thanks!
