 * Re-specialization: A feature that allows you to change the look of your secondary profession/trinket by visiting an NPC has been added.
 * You can now assign skill points to multiple recipes. This feature can be accessed via the profession UI by clicking on the "Skill Points" button next to the "Recipe" or "Selected Recipes" button, or by clicking on the "Skill Points" button in the upper right corner of the portrait. Multiple profession/trinkets can be assigned skill points on the same recipe, but the feature only works for recipes with skill points up for reagent crafting currently.
 * Reagent crafting now has a reagent cap. To account for the additional random element required to get all the ingredients to a reagent, the cap has been increased to 50.
 * You can now assign skill points to multiple recipes that require less reagents, by visiting an NPC in the city or logging in with the NPC in your party. You will not be able to use this feature for recipes that require gold, silver, or copper.
 * Multiple reagents can be assigned skill points on the same recipe, but the reagent cap has been increased to 50.
 * Gold, silver, and copper will no longer be awarded for the same recipe if a player obtains both the materials by a specific combination. For example, if a player obtains both gold and copper from a recipe and then silver from another recipe, the silver will be awarded first, followed by gold.
 * Players will no longer be able to use the "Refresh All" button to refresh an arena team before a scheduled game. The Refresh All button appears when a team is due a forfeit and will not refresh when a team has not been due a forfeit.
 * Players will no longer be able to use the "Random Matchmaking" feature to queue for a specific game type under specific restrictions. For example, someone who attempts to queue for Conquest of the Eastern Plaguelands or Battle for Azeroth PvP will be placed into a queue for PvP only Azeroth games, or for a time when the PvP cap is reached.
 * Random Matchmaking: In addition to allowing players to queue for specific games, players can now randomly find opponents with the Random option in either scenario. When playing against someone randomly, the Random option will always show as available, regardless of any previous opponents that may have been in the queue.

====================
A short time ago we introduced you to the concept of a "turbo charge", whereby a player's powers and abilities temporarily increase in efficiency by applying a small amount of additional damage or healing to an already-existing effect on the target. Today we're introducing you to the concept of a "turbo-honor charge", whereby when demonstrating mastery of a role, your auto-attack hits an additional nearby target for a large damage bonus.

Together, these two changes represent the first step toward what we hope to see in World of Warcraft: instant, automatic, customizable, peer-to-peer damage and healing. While we still have lots of work to do in order to fully realize this vision, we can at least say that it's a start.

EDITOR'S NOTE: This article discusses an ongoing topic within the World of Warcraft development team. We'd like to hear your thoughts on the subject. Please send suggestions to the forum administrator.

====================
BATTLE FOR AZEROTH SEASON 2

-Between the events of the first and second season of Battle for Azeroth, the night elves have been attacked by an unknown, deadly force. The Warchief believes this attack was ordered by Wyrmrest Accord, and that the Nightfallen who perpetrated the attack is indeed the one responsible. The Warchief leads a strike team of twelve heroes, led by Warchief Kael'thas, on a daring escape from Orgrimmar. The Warchief and his men face an overwhelming number of Ogri'la, but they will soon run out of options. The Ogri’la they face will be no match for the Warchief’s strength and determination. Players will now be able to lead a strike team in combat, starting at level 100. The Ogri’la in the first season of Battle for Azeroth will be much tougher than they appear in the second.

====================
The amount of newly allocated gold in the game should be fairly consistent between acts 6 and 11 of any given dungeon. However, in order to make even modest amounts of this new Conquest gear possible, we've raised its item level considerably. This means that players will generally see a larger selection of items in their inventories if they are geared toward Gold or Honorbound gear. In addition, existing items that upgrade in quality to higher-tier versions should be able to upgrade further, as we've done for other items in this series.

NEW FEATURE: HALLOW'S END

We're thrilled at the reception this event has received. Not only have we had many requests for this endgame endgame gear, but many players have been incredibly kind and generous with their suggestions of which unique alternate methods they might use to get to Halloween's end. In addition to all of the above, there's been a special Halloween event in Stormwind this last weekend that involved trick-or-treating. Thanks!

THE STORY OF BORDER CORNER

Nearly two years have passed since the Alliance and the Horde laid siege to Hellfire Citadel – the heart of the Burning Legion's power – and the war that followed has seen the heroes of the Horde and Alliance enter a new phase of their conflict.


While the war in eastern Plaguelands has seen great valor on the part of both sides, an equally great effort has been made to minimize casualties amongst the ranks of both factions. As such, the level of combat in the war has been gradually lowered over time – gradually opening the way for a possible future New Azeroth!

DARKFRONT

The High Warlord Kil'jaeden has forged an accord with the Witch-King Azeroth to lead the way against the Legion. The Alliance has agreed to aid the war effort, while the Legion has been folded into the War on Terror. The two factions will now each lead a wing of a wing that will attack the enemy capital – the exact location of this new Nagrand raid dungeon has yet to be confirmed.

NAGRAN

Nagrand has been added to the game world as a fully-fledged zone with a number of new features, including an exclusive dungeon for Legion, a new chapter of the War on Terror expansion that is set in Nagrand, and a raid-style version of the raid dungeon, all of which can be attempted at level 80. In addition to the dungeon and raid sections, Nagrand also features a faction-based aspect, meaning players can visit their faction-based counterparts to obtain the requisite reputation to challenge them – all of these efforts will be at no additional cost.

THE LEGENDARY QUEST CONTINUES

Years after the events of the previous expansion, the Legion have breached the Nighthold and begun to explore the galaxy. In an effort to locate and rescue Nathaniel Garrosh, the heroes have managed to gather considerable resources, including the Orb of Deception, which promises to open a new chapter in the War on Terror. However, the Orb of Deception has a flaw – if the heroes are to discover the full extent of the Legion's reach, then vengeance will be too great a price to pay for victory.

THE LEGENDARY QUEST CONTINUES

Years have passed since the Nighthold's Guardians were last active, and the Legion have apparently reached the end of their destructive journey on Azeroth. With nothing to lose, the heroes have taken to colonizing the galaxy with a view to one day returning to reclaim our lost home.

PROFESSIONS

 * Players may discover 3 new recipes that can be combined to create legendary items that can be used to directly upgrade a legendary item from the previous version of the expansion.
 * Players may discover 3 new recipes that can be combined to create legendary items that can be used to directly upgrade a legendary item from the previous version of the expansion.

      SHADOW CHANGES
      
      Shadow priests had one large problem toward the end of Mists of Pandaria: single-target damage. Their AoE and multi-DoT damage was some of the best around, so they still ended up competitive on most fights. But, in any fight that was mostly single-target, they felt lacking. Additionally, one of the new stats we're adding in Warlords of Draenor, Multistrike, is almost exactly what their current Mastery, [Shadowy Recall], does for DoTs. So, we took these two problems and came up with a change that we think will solve both of them. The result is a new Mastery: Shadowy Recall, a new Mastery for Shadow Priests that primarily increases the single-target portion of their DoTs but also works well for multistrikes.
      
      
       *  [Silence] has been replaced with [Silence].
       *  [Silence] now costs 30 Energy in addition to its current effects.
       *  [Void Tendrils] now deal 15% less damage.
      
      
      Of course, in an ideal world, all three stats would go into zero when Void Tendrils or Void Ebbers are destroyed, leaving only 3 active stats. That's why we buffed both of these abilities, and why we removed the 3rd ability altogether. However, in practice, it's not that simple. Sometimes destroying a tank's primary target means that that target doesn't get affected by our defensive stats, and those that are not tanking generally do not benefit from that destruction. Therefore, we buffed them differently. This will allow more tanks to benefit from these stats, and still will, but will not defeat the point of destroying secondary targets.
      
      
       *  [Summon Darkglare] now lasts 8 seconds (was 5 seconds).
       *  [Darkglare]'s damage has been increased by 250%.
       *  [Shadowform] no longer removes movement-impairing effects.
       *  [Void Bolt] now deals 105% of weapon damage (was 75%).

WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON D.C. – Today, April 2, 2015, marks the one-year anniversary of the Burning Crusade. The Burning Crusade was a massive success, earning Blizzard Entertainment—and subsequently, World of Warcraft—over 10 million unique players. Following the success of the Burning Crusade, Blizzard decided to take a fresh look at their Path of Exile system. They decided to change up the Order Lock system in Hearthstone, and added a fresh, new feature, Random Encrypted Matter.

The Random Encrypted Matter system is what makes the upcoming [Grand Unified Planets] unique. Grand Unified Planets is what makes all future expansions free-for-all, with each expansion requiring a unique lock to be obtained. As such, this plan was very important to us. Therefore, we're changing the system to allow players the chance to unify their Order Locks in one place, at anytime.

INTRODUCING RAIDS
We wanted to present an updated, more fun way for raiding with friends new and old. That's why we're introducing Raid Finder, a new system that lets you queue for and join a raid of any size for any content type, at a moment's notice. Not on the same day, but at a moment's notice.

RAIDS
TRAVELING IS NOW A THING

With the launch of Battle for Azeroth, we set out to make gearing your class or spec a little easier. To that end, we've made it so you don't need to grind through item level 1-10 to get the occasional item that might drop. You can now do all of the hard, time-consuming, role-specific work yourself, instead of having a team of people tell you what to do.

We're also pleased to announce that all 9-slot raid bags have been reduced to 5-slot configurations, so you can now take advantage of the reduced pricing we've seen with this new system. 5-slot systems are available for those raiding with four or more slots, 4-slot systems are available for those raiding with three or more slots, and 1-10 slot raid bags are available for those raiding with all of the required slots.

One major difference between this new system and the old system is that we've made it so you don't need to grind through item levels 1-10 to get items that might drop from random (non-boss) encounters. The end result is that you won't necessarily be broke if you drop an item in 10-slot (or even 1-10) RAID Finder (or any other random drop), but you won't be broke if you drop that same item in a normal raid either.

RAID GUILDS

We've added the Riot Guard to the new Raid Finder (and the existing Raid Finder) as a means to reduce queue times. The Riot Guard can be found in the same raid frames as other raid-specific characters, but has a 100% chance to drop an item in Raid Finder difficulty (up from 50% chance).

STORY AND WORLD

Many changes have been made to the story behind the cataclysm world events: the invasion of Kalimdor, the rise of the Burning Legion, and the War Campaign. These world events have been overhauled to provide a smoother transition into the War Campaign.

NPC CHANGES

Many NPCs that are not supposed to be in the raid have been changed to appear in a raid, either by changing their color or their model. While this fixes an issue with previous patches, it also introduces an entirely new system of handling things in Raid Finder (which we call ‘Cruisin' the Truest) difficulty. This new system makes all NPCs relative no more 'forbidden fruit.'

This world event also saw the addition of a new mechanic:

* All nearby players become invisible when [Cruisin' the Truesteel] is activated.
 * The mechanic works exactly like a [Collectronic Module], except with a twist: when activated, it also causes the camera to be turned to that which drives the character’s thrusters, thus obscuring their actual location.

The hidden loot in this raid was that which dropped, not who dropped it. As such, it has been scaled back in value to be commensurate to the size of the reward.

PROFESSIONS

Many new recipes have been added to assist players in obtaining the resources they need to power their raid.


 * Many recipes in high demand by dungeon groups will now require significantly less [Collectronic Module] schematics to create.
 * A new high-end profession that only players of the appropriate class can acquire is now available.
 * Small but significant improvements have been made to many recipes in the high-end profession skill tree. Many of the recipes in this tree will be off-spec and thus unable to be applied to a non-
====================
Event Time: The first three boss encounters of the day are now available and battle for a chance at a rare gem that can grant a glimpse of victory!
Featuring a host of new additions, including a glimpse of victory for the Horde at the Battle of Dazar'alor, the Isle of Dread and the Dalaran Sewer, The Third War Campaign is open once again this year on November 14th.
ALL NEW FEATURE: ADVENTURE GUIDE
Adventure Guide NPCs have been added to a number of new encounters throughout the world. In addition, players can now navigate through these encounters on a map, enabling them to find and fight the appropriate creatures without constantly looking for markers.

In this new version, you'll find a new "marshal" (pronounced /ˈmɛrdʒl), a faction NPC who'll direct your party toward the Adventure Guide if you're in a group, and who'll offer whatever guidance you need during a particular encounter. Marshals are friendly toward NPCs, and will usually lead players to a location that's more conducive to their type of adventure.

INSPECT

A new inspect bar has been added to the world. You can use this new interface to inspect other players, trade goods, and look for additional rewards.

UNIQUE
A number of unique items have been added to the treasure lists for Brawler's Guild.

LEGENDARY ITEM ADJUSTMENTS:
DEATH KNIGHT
ALLIED RACES

FIGHTERS of both the blade and the shield are now considered to be of the same race, and will thus receive a reduction in rewards from the original quest chain.


The two-headed ogre mage, however, still cannot be paired with a pair of four-headed plate dragons.

ILLUMINATION

All new achievements and rewards have been added for the Illidan lore quest.

SKETTIS

The Skyguard, Sha’tari warriors specializing in their command of the skies above Shattrath, have acquired an ability that allows them to see the stars. Those who understand the language of the Skyguard will be able to learn the plot of this quest.

TRAVELING

A number of new flying exploits have been added, including a ride-able zeppelin, the Kodo Caravan, and the Kodo Transport.

USER INTERFACE

 * Quest Tracking has been added to the Inbox.
 * Dungeon Journal has been expanded with new information on all raid bosses.
 * Achievements which are earned while leveling can be tracked on the World Map.
 * Randomized Daily quests have been added to the Dungeon Journal. Randomized Daily quests will award different rewards based on the current level of the dungeon.
 * For additional notes on Lua and XML changes please visit the UI & Macros forum.

GRAPHICS

 * Improved water and lava rendering system (Video Options - Liquid Detail on the Graphics Panel)
 * Dynamic Sunshafts effect (Video Options - Sunshafts on the Graphics Panel)

ALPHA

ALPHA is a new additive shader technology that replaces OpenGL for rendering in D3D games. It adds an additional texture resolution, multiplies the shader's frequency by a fixed number, and provides better performance on many modern shaders.

NEW FEATURE: FINE PRINT

With this patch we introduce the new feature Fine Print. The FINE PRINT texture format has been improved to 1x per pixel, 4x for World of Warcraft patches, and will be the main interface for many new features in the future. Before we dive into details of how this new interface will work, however, a couple of notes.

Patch 7.0.3a has limited support for new graphic cards from the NVIDIA Corporation. Previous to this patch, all NVIDIA cards were not correctly patched to 7.0.3a.

We have not had any success with automating the hotfix to the issues with the Dragon Sleeves.

Currently, in order to comply with a new patch requirement of Dragon Sleeves 7.0.3a, all Dragon Sleeves will require a patch 7.0.3a hotfix.

HOW TO INSTALL

Once you have the client up and running, you will need to follow the on-screen instructions to install the client. If you are not already familiar with how to do that, please read How to Install the Clients .

      One of the most talked about changes in the WoW game has been the Alignment system. The entire game has been redesigned to be less intuitive, more accessible, and more intuitive. We've broken down the Alignment system into 4 different phases: Pre-Alignment, Alignment, Post-Alignment, and Flexibility.
      
      
      Before we talk about how this change affects you, let's first clarify what exactly this is. The Pre-Alignment phase allowed you to make tough calls about which expansion to support. We're pretty sure most players found that the Alignment they chose was no different than the previous version, but hey, it was a change!
      
      
      So, what does it do? It smooths out the initial announcement of an expansion by giving players a reason to want to support it. It also helps players avoid making the wrong choice between an expansion and a random pre-release build.
      
      
       * Pre-Alignment 
          * Alignment points now determine which pre-release content you get to in each patch. Points can be earned for Honorable Kills, which means "for which realm" the bonus content is applied.
          * Points can be earned for completing specific objectives, both inside and outside of the game.
          * Alignment points are no longer based on realm power or account bonuses. 
              * For Honorable Kills, characters earn extra points based on the modifiers of each bonus.
              * For example, a character who earns 2400 Alignment points for completing the objectives of "A Feast for the Seven" receives a 2400 Alignment bonus instead of a normal 2400.
             
             
          * After the official announcement of an expansion, updates on how the content will be received quickly follow.
          * Realm by Realm Testing 
               * All new PvP items can be on the PTR from the Fantasy layer.
               * Characters can test their wings on the Arathi Basin battlefield.
               * For additional notes on testing process changes, see the blog titled: Patch 6.0.2 Patch Notes: Testing Realm Issues.
             
             
          * Characters can join as individuals in a raid or split up into smaller groups for a limited time in order to test new content and meet the requirements of a new raid. 
               * For example, you can test with 10 other individuals or try to find 5 others to join together in a raid.
               * You can queue as an individual and then as a group, or you can test as a group and then as an individual.
              * You can be in a group and a queue and still access the same features, but you can only enter the queue and be in that group or queue for one hour.
              * The raid window will remain open while you are in a group or queue, so you can quickly pop out of the group or queue and quickly reopen the raid window to test your group or queue status.
             
             
          * A weekly cooldown will also be applied to keep you posted on when and how often to show up in Ashran.
         
         
      
      NEW FEATURE: FOLLOWERS
      
      New followers can be earned by following a particular player or following a specific pattern. Followers can be earned primarily through

FROST PRISON

Many races in the frozen wastes know of Frost Prison—its dark secret, where secrets of the Frost Legion are kept for the pitiable champions of the Horde and Alliance to read. But few know its true purpose: to be the vanguard of a massive invasion of the icy wastes against the denizens of Shattrath City.

Shadows of Elune

Elune's light is waning, and she will not stand idly by while the Horde and Alliance are forced to fight their own war. The two races who will assume the Lich King's place in the Lich King's Shadow gallery when the time comes will be few. The Scourge have spies amongst the Kirin Tor, and this information will play a major role in leading the Scourge into the invasion.

War Missions

While the War Missions in Warlords of Draenor are focused on the invasion of Draenor, players will occasionally stumble across a mission that could turn the tide of the war. This mission, which appears in your journal when you first embark on a War Mission, will be of particular interest to you.


The mission you discover will directly result in turning the tide of the war, by aiding your faction in the invasion of Draenor.

UNDOCUMENTED MISSION: UL'AMIR

 * During the invasion of Outland by forces of the Horde, a group of trolls goes by the nom de guerre UL'AMIR. The group is led by a mysterious figure known as the "Shadow Succubus," and is engaged in a fierce battle with the forces of the Horde and Alliance.

DARK FRONTS

 * Due to the constant presence of the Frostwolf clan throughout the years, all members of the Frostwolf clan are now considered honorable.

 * The Conquest reward for a win above the weekly cap now increases at a rate of 5 Conquest Points per week ending on the 5th week of Season 2, instead of increasing at a rate of 10 Conquest Points per week ending on the 22nd.
 * Weekly Conquest reward caps have been changed. To better balance the amount of Conquest Points awarded for a win, members of the team that currently has the highest weekly cap will receive the benefit of the cap increase at the expense of any previous week's reward.
 * Tiebreakers and Bonus Events
    * Winning a tiebreaker during the first week of Season 2 will award players with a weekly bonus of 200 Conquest Points, while the bonus for a win during the second week will award players with a weekly bonus of 150 Conquest Points.

January 22, 2019
For ages untold, Dazar'alor has stood at the center of the great and powerful Zandalari empire. Its guards have thwarted numerous attempts on King Rastakhan's life, and it has endured trials both ancient and new. But as war reaches the shores of Zuldazar, the Alliance embarks on a daring gambit to besiege the golden pyramid and sever the Zandalari's bond to the Horde.

December 10, 2018
The war raging across Azeroth between Alliance and Horde has intensified. As the Alliance lays plans to retake Darkshore and regain a foothold in Kalimdor, both factions have redoubled their attacks across the zone.

NEW RAID: THRONE OF THUNDER
BATTLEGROUND OF THUNDER

The devastating events of the War Campaign have spawned a new 3-boss raid, complete with new rewards. Those interested in the War Campaign can now undertake the dungeon from either Hardmode or Normalmode, and loot the secrets that will lead to victory.

NEW FEATURE: APEXIS CRYSTALS

These new crystals are positioned higher on the crystal tower than usual, meaning that they'll affect abilities like [Metamorphosis], [Frostfire Bolt], [Blizzard], [Frost Armor], [Ice Lance], and [Frost Armor].

NEW FREIGHTY QUEEN

A free-for-all for all-
====================
New high-level Artifact glyphs can be found in the Broken Isles and introduced at the Legion launch. The glyph involved is … well, you'll figure it out.

NEW HIGH-LEVEL ARMOR: ARMOR OF JUSTICE

 * In a world with a new breed of powerful heroes known as the Legion, Plate of Justice might just be the perfect addition to your collection.

BATTLE PETS: PETS OF WAR AND RESOLVE

Many special, unique, and fantastic new battle pets have been added to the Broken Isles. In this brave new pet regime, you'll no longer be able to trade in your current battle pet for a legendary pet.

FIGHT THE STUPID: THE BUG IS IN, TAKE THE F*CK OUT

 * Fight the Stupid: The bug that crashes the game when trying to open the loot window has been fixed. Apparently, players with Revive abilities were having trouble overwriting old loot.

RAID: THE FUCKING KEEP

Wrath of the Titans is upon us, and this time the Titans are not appeased. You'll head to the Dark Portal in Plane of Shadow to face the wrath of the Burning Legion.

RAID: HELLFIRE CITADEL

Raise your sword or shield, and prepare for an all-new encounter with Hellfire Citadel's fearsome warriors. In this new raid, your character will be assaulted by the very soul of the Illidari, starting the quest that begins your journey toward understanding the Broken Isles.

NEW RAID: CRUCIBLE OF THUNDER

 * In a world without electricity, a group of unlikely heroes stumble upon an ancient ritual that could unleash the might of the Legion. But this is just the beginning. Before long, they'll be faced with the fearsome task of defending their home from the Legion's reach… before leaping into the portal that leads to the surface.
