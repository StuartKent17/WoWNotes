World Of Warcraft:  [Forsaken Wastes]

 [Terminus Oculatus]
Chalice Of Fire
Blizzenblitz 


A short time ago we introduced you to the concept of a "turbo charge", whereby a player's powers and abilities temporarily increase in efficiency by applying a small amount of additional damage or healing to an already-existing effect on the target. Today we're introducing you to the concept of a "turbo-honor charge", whereby when demonstrating mastery of a role, your auto-attack hits an additional nearby target for a large damage bonus.

Together, these two changes represent the first step toward what we hope to see in World of Warcraft: instant, automatic, customizable, peer-to-peer damage and healing. While we still have lots of work to do in order to fully realize this vision, we can at least say that it's a start.

EDITOR'S NOTE: This article discusses an ongoing topic within the World of Warcraft development team. We'd like to hear your thoughts on the subject. Please send suggestions to the forum administrator.

From time to time, we’ll announce a number of things related to World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade. We’re excited to announce that we’re working on a new expansion for World of Warcraft, The Burning Crusade: Rise of Azshara. We’re also excited to announce that we’re working on a new expansion for StarCraft®: Legacy of the Void™.

We’re also happy to announce that we’re also working on a new expansion for Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, which we’re calling Hearthstone: The Burning Crusade.

In addition, we’re also excited to announce that we’re working on a new expansion for World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade: Rise of Azshara. The Burning Crusade will take place in the ruined world of Azeroth after the events of the Cataclysm. The Burning Legion is a demonic force that has arisen in the world of Azeroth, and it’s up to the heroes to stop it. The heroes have been battling the forces of the Burning Legion since the beginning of the war between the Horde and the Alliance, but the conflict is far from over.

The Burning Legion’s assault on Azeroth has set in motion a chain of events that will lead to the end of the world, and the arrival of the Burning Legion. This new expansion will be a brand-new story with an epic conclusion. The story begins with the events of the Battle of Dazar’alor, when the armies of both the Horde and the Alliance must take the fight to the heart of the Burning Legion’s power. As the heroes of both sides prepare for their ultimate battle, they will encounter the Legion’s most powerful champions, the Burning Legion’s greatest champions, and the mysterious and powerful draenei who stand in their way.

A new chapter opens in the Warcraft universe when the heroes of the Horde and the Alliance face the Burning Legion’s greatest champions, who have all fled to the world’s inner sanctums to face the Legion’s might. With the help of the draenei, the heroes of the Horde and the Alliance will be able to face the forces of the Legion’s war effort.

The story of the Burning Crusade begins with the events of the Battle of Dazar’alor. The battle between the Horde and the Alliance has erupted into a full-scale conflict that threatens the very existence of Azeroth. The orcs, orcs, and their blood elf allies have held the planet for nearly a thousand years, and now it is up to the heroes to stop the Burning Legion’s reign of terror.

The heroes of the Horde and the Alliance have begun a campaign to reclaim Azeroth’s once-forgotten treasures, but the ancient enemy of Azeroth is far from defeated. The forces of the heroes must now face the forces of the Burning Legion, who have been at the forefront of the assault against the world. In the face of the demonic forces that have begun to threaten the world, the heroes must once again face their greatest foes.

The heroes will face a series of new challenges as they try to reclaim Azeroth’s treasures, including the location of the first of the great two-pronged axe, which is located within the depths of the depths of the world, and the location of the second of the great two-pronged axe, which lies at the center of the world.








The expansion will introduce a new class, Warlock, to World of Warcraft, with new spells and abilities. Players will be able to choose from a wide array of Warlocks, including the fearsome Warlocks of the Burning Legion, the chaotic and deadly Shadow Priests, the mighty Feral Druids, and the formidable and deadly Nightborne. The Warlords of Draenor will join forces with other players and their pets, and will take on a variety of challenges and experiences.
