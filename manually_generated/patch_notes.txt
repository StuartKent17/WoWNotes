====================
This week marks the 10th anniversary of the Guild Awards. During that time, we've seen the awarding of Guild Awards become a formalized way to recognize outstanding guild achievements, and the Guild Awards themselves become objects of celebration instead of punishment.
       * Guild Awards are now presented in the form of Guild Challenges. Win or lose, you will receive a Guild Challenge for a random guild in Guild History.
       * Guild Challenges can be won via the guild experience bar or by simply accepting the announcement on Twitter that a guild has an award. Acceptance of Guild Challenges is not required, but it is recommended.
       * Win a Guild Challenge for an existing guild that hasn�t seen enough awards ceremonies this year.
       * After winning a Guild Challenge, players have a chance to win an item that will allow entry to a randomly selected guild that has a similar theme to the guild they are challenging.
       * Announcements from past guilds supporting the guild challenging theme will be viewable on the guild leader board.
       * Successfully completing guild challenges and winning the guild challenge will earn credit for a new reputation category.
       * Once a guild has been granted credit for a particular theme, players can accept the guild challenge in any of the guild's chat channels (use /to accept for a guild challenge, /to lose for a guild challenge, /for all others) to gain access to that guild's chat channel.
       * Once accepted, players in that guild will be able to access the assigned guild chat channel (as seen here) through either their guild interface or the chat interface (coming soon to all major guilds).
       * Guild Leaders can invite a GM or a raid group for a given dungeon instance. A GM can be selected by the guild master or the guild leader based on the available roll call slot.
       * Upon accepting a guild challenge, players will be asked to fill out a Request for Raid or Warning Sheet. Both these sheets can be viewed in the guild leader support forum.
       * Once a player has accepted a guild challenge, they will be asked to fill out a Request for Player Help. This form allows the GM or the raid group to access the player directly while the player is out of the guild or out of the area (ex: /to request a player for raid group).
       * Once a player has submitted a raid or group for a given dungeon, they will receive an acknowledgement response email from the guild via the Guild Portal.
       * All requests for assistance are logged and tracked on the account, so players can access help from the account controls if they are experiencing any issues.
       * The account controls for a given realm are located on the same tab as the rest of the world, so players can access the account controls there as well.
       * The request log is now divided into sections for each type of request, allowing easier sorting of requests.
       * Players can now use the �Talk to a GM� function to submit a request and receive a response.
       * A link to the account controls page now provides a confirmation dialogue to allow players to select the account control that they would like to use.
       * A link to the account settings page now provides confirmation dialogue to allow players to modify the game client settings.
       * Players can now lock out additional features by clicking on the �Lock Out� button on the account screen.
       * Added a new option to toggle floating combat text on and off.
      

      
      NEW FEATURE: REST STATE CHANGES
      
       * Players now have an additional layer of protection against being attacked while

 
   
 * Pets
   *  [Avoidance] (passive): Now reduces damage taken by 5% while dodgeable, but no
   longer reduces the amount of damage taken while dodgeable.
   *  [Cower]: Now reduces the amount of damage taken while dodgeable by 20%, but
   is no longer affected by Mastery.
   * Cower: Now reduces damage taken while dodgeable by 30% and increases damage
    taken by 10% while dodgeable by 60%.
   *  [Cower]: Duration is now 8 seconds, but can no longer be used in
    trades.      
       
       
        

       
        *  [Blessing of Sanctuary], [Blessing of Kings], [Blessing of Sacrifice], and [Blessing of
   Protection] have been replaced with new spells: [Blessing of Kings], [Blessing
   of Sacrifice], [Blessing of Wisdom], [Blessing of Kings], [Blessing of Wisdom],
   and [Blessing of Sacrifice].
   
   HEALING UPDATES

Recently, receiving a healing aura from a Paladin's healing aura
will now heal you for the amount that you intended to receive it from the
heart.
   
   
   Champions of Light (Artifact trait)
       * There is now a new [Divine Prowl] PvP ability available to all
                                                
                     
     Stoneforge Quartermaster Azrael will now properly
   resurrect you with the Stoneforge Quartermaster's energy.     
          
          
                BLOOD CHANGES
      
      Blood type was the determining factor on the decisions Blizzard made in
        the course of their recent Resilience work. In order to properly
        balance the number of health and survivability of their damage
        mitigation, we've taken steps to remove that factor from the game. We
        will be making a Major Resolve patch to address this in a major way,
        reducing the number of points spent on Resilience by the same amount and
        merging it with baseline Resilience. As such, the Blood deathrattle we
        are making now has a smaller number of points to compensate for the
        removal of Resilience. The scaling and diminishing returns of those
        changes will continue to be the focus of the discussion of scaling and diminishing
        returns for different stats.
      
      
       * Blood deathrattlers now start with a healthy amount of health, but will burn more
         health per blood point (while in [Resilience]) upon death. This will
         be different for each class, specialization, and tree.
         

            / [Rapture] can now be cast anywhere in the world
             and is a global cooldown.

         
BUG FIXES

 * Fixed an issue that caused certain Macs to become stuck.
 * Fixed an issue that caused some players in the East Coast to become
 
 
 

      
      
      In order to make room for more Haste effects to apply to [Focused Will], a priest's haste has been modified by the Multistrike stat. For example, a priest who had a base Haste of 4% using a 4-point talent (instead of a 3% Haste increase from a 3-point talent) would now receive a 4% increase to their base Haste amount instead of 3% for using that talent.
      
      
       *  [Guarded by the Light] now increases Stamina by 45% (up from 35%), and the amount healed by [Flash Heal] by 45% (up from 30%), but no longer increases healing done by [Heal].
       *  [Stance of the Wounded] has been removed.
       *  [Leap of Faith]'s mana cost has been reduced by 80%.
       *  [Spirit Shell] is now a level-25 talent, replacing [Spiritual Healing].
      
      
      We've also made a few other changes to the talents that bless specific spells. In particular, we've changed the way [Focused Will], [Divine Providence], [Guardian Spirit], and [Holy Light] are applied to the periodic healing effect of [Renew].
      
      
      
      
      
      WE ARE NOW A GROUP OF TALENTED GROUPS WHO PREACHES THE LAW OF NATURE AND VALOR AS WELL AS PVP.
      
       * We're looking for a group of players who are tough as nails and also some who may just be able to shed a few too many tears.
       * We're a group of players who follow the adventures of Queen Azshara. As such, we're a bit of a collection of professions.
       * Queen Azshara herself is a player-created encounter that can be found in icy Craggy Paths in Ashenvale. As such, players can make use of her unique abilities and play to win the encounter.
       * The best part? (Item #7692) is an item that just so happens to be on the same plane as the Wracked item that spawned him!
      
      
    * Also worth noting is the fact that the items that spawn under the appropriate class banner (Classes #11, Pets #11, etc.) now all share a single tabard slot.
    * Also worth noting is the fact that many of the items on this new tabard are of the Fetid variety. Fetid in appearance, functionally speaking.
    * Also of note is the fact that each class can now craft up to 4 item of the Fetid variety (Classes #11, Pets #11, etc.).
    
    
          
      
    * New Level-60 Ability: [Ritual of Summoning]
       * Summons a random raid or world raid boss.
       * Cooldown is 1 minute, duration is 1 minute.
       * Maelstrom Weapon emote now has a visual that identifies it as an Enrage ability.
       * Ability has a 3-minute cooldown.
      
      
      
      
           MAGE
      
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For mages, we focused thinning out the niche and abilities that weren't used often. We made sure to retain abilities for mages to function in off-spec roles, since that flexibility is a defining characteristic of the class.
      
      
       *  [Arcane Barrage] has been removed.
       *  [Arcane Concentration]: The damage reduction afforded by this talent now exists, but is unavailable to the Warrior.
       *  [Arctic Winds] is no longer available to the Mage.
       *  [Remove Magic] is now available to the Priest.
       *  [Remove Curse] is now available to the Warlock.
       *  [Shatter] is no longer available to the Warlock.
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
             TALENT SYSTEM
      
      Like priests, mages have a talent system. Talents are now earned by completing quests. Focused on clearcasting, the talent system provides a mechanism for rewarding specialization in PvP.
      
      
       *  [Clergy Training] is now available to players who have completed the class quest [70] Seeking Arcane Power.
       *  [Focused Prayers] has been removed and replaced with a new talent, [Evangelism]. 
          * Focused Prayers reduces the cost of [Devouring Plague], [Frost Fever], [Pestilence], and [Choking Fog] by 50% for 6 seconds each time it is cast.
         
         
       *  [Frost Presence] has been removed and replaced with a new talent, [Glacial Spike]. 
          *  [Ice Barrier]: Replaces [Ice Block]. Does not stack with other effects that increase the Priest's Defense.
          *  [Inner Focus]: Instead of redirecting all mana with a single use, this talent now increases the effect of all Mana Shield spells by 10/20/30% for 6 seconds each time it is used.
         


       * A new quest has been added to complete for players on the Isle of Thunder.
       * Players who complete the quest " [90] Thundering Point" will receive a
         rare [Thundering Point Cap] item.




      ROGUE
      ABILITIES
      
      A number of abilities were added for rogues to aid in their adventivist pursuits. In addition to the new abilities provided by the Assassin class, rogues now also receive a bonus to secondary stat bonuses (Critical Strike, Mastery, etc.) when [Assassination] is used in Stealth.
      
      
      *  [Blind] is now a passive ability. The damage and slow effects of Blind will not be applied to the rogue if they are attacked while Blinded.

   BATTLE FOR AZEROTH SEASON 2

-Between the events of the first and second season of Battle for Azeroth, the night elves have been attacked by an unknown, deadly force. The Warchief believes this attack was ordered by Wyrmrest Accord, and that the Nightfallen who perpetrated the attack is indeed the one responsible. The Warchief leads a strike team of twelve heroes, led by Warchief Kael'thas, on a daring escape from Orgrimmar. The Warchief and his men face an overwhelming number of Ogri'la, but they will soon run out of options. The Ogri’la they face will be no match for the Warchief’s strength and determination. Players will now be able to lead a strike team in combat, starting at level 100. The Ogri’la in the first season of Battle for Azeroth will be much tougher than they appear in the second.

-The second season of Battle for Azeroth will feature a new balance of druid talent trees. As part of this process, we have made several changes to druid talents.
    * The level cap has been increased to 100.
    * The Rejuvenation bar is now grayed out.
    * New Ability: Solarium Barrage (Level 100).
    * Casting a longer channeled spell (e.g. [Solaric Power]) will wake up your next sleeping target.
    * Healing targets over level 60 now receive twice the expected bonus to healing from [Healing Rain].
    *  [Feast of Souls] will no longer cancel upon taking damage.
    * Rage generated per melee swing reduced by 14%. This was to reduce the frequency of [Fatal Attractions] where this was not optimal.
    * Rage generated while sitting increased to 200% from 200%.
    * The [Gladiator's Slicer] auto-attack damage has been increased by 215%, but the reload time has been increased to 2.3 seconds (was 2.0 seconds).
    * Hunters will no longer miss with [Dismiss Pet] and [Dismiss] while using [Auto Shot].

The amount of newly allocated gold in the game should be fairly consistent between acts 6 and 11 of any given dungeon. However, in order to make even modest amounts of this new Conquest gear possible, we've raised its item level considerably. This means that players will generally see a larger selection of items in their inventories if they are geared toward Gold or Honorbound gear. In addition, existing items that upgrade in quality to higher-tier versions should be able to upgrade further, as we've done for other items in this series.
      
      
       * Any characters that completed the previous Acts of War for a random dungeon will receive a new title, "Co-Founder of Hyjal," which will entitle them to a new mount.
       * Players that are not already on the Co-Founder of Hyjal will be able to obtain it by speaking with Archmage Timear in the Timeless Isle or by speaking with Vashj in Undercity.
       * The title of "Co-Founder of Hyjal" is automatically granted to players who are already on the Isle of Hyjal.
       * Level 90 players that are not already on the Isle of Hyjal can access the Timeless Isle by speaking with Archmage Timear in the Timeless Isle.
       * Under the Timeless Isle, players can access the Timeless Isle by speaking with Vashj in Undercity.
       * Vashj also has a variety of other functions, including:
          * Vashj the Falling: Teleports players to Vashj the Falling's side of the island.
          * Vashj the Living: Removes players from combat.
          * Arosyn the Tape: Sorts the dungeon pieces in reverse order of their appearance on the platform they're on.
         
         






      DUNGEONS
      
       * Players now receive an automatic "Discover" alert when an area of the dungeon they have already discovered is presented to them.
       * An area of the dungeon that is not revealed via the Discover system will now require a 2-hour exploration period prior to being available for the player to discover.
       * Unlike other Raid Finder dungeons, players do not automatically discover dungeons on their first attempt. As such, players may find themselves at a stalemate when attempting to queue for a given dungeon.
       * Dungeon Finder: Tabs for each wing now allow a player to navigate to a random tab for a given dungeon.
       * The Random tab allows a random group of players to queue together.

GENERAL

 * Bonus Armor: The amount of bonus armor you receive when you're tanking a boss has been increased by 33%.
 * Chances are, your luck has run out and you will not be receiving a full 300% bonus to attack power for your efforts. To compensate, you will receive a smaller and smaller amount of bonus armor.
 * Cooldown: The amount of cooldown you must wait before a boss kill has been increased by 50%.
 * Dispel Resist: This ability now has a 9 second duration.


 *  [Lights, Camera, Bacon]: These mounts now have their own unique sound when engaged in combat.


 * Dungeons and Raids
    * Failing to complete a keystone in time no longer causes a crash.
    * Battle of Dazar'alor
       * A number of character behavioral issues affecting players while transformed into the opposite faction have been fixed. These include fixes to Paladins' [Divine Steed] and Shadow Priests' language after exiting [Voidform].
       * Opulence
          * Fixed a bug that caused the coin shower visual to sometimes persist longer than intended.
         



WARCRAFT: THE MOVIE: THE GAME: THE MOVIE

We've consulted with an engineer who “Blackout” anvils “cause he can.

PURCHASSE
FOR ALL RACES

Coming soon to a Nintendo eShop near you




ENGINEERING

 * New recipes are available from the Thrallmar Quartermaster, Ryan Stonebinder in Orgrimmar.
 * Engineers can now find and complete a new recipe to craft [Fused Wiring] that can be used to craft an [Ultimate Charger] for Engineers.
 * The [Mechanical Dragonling]'s speed has been increased, and it can now be pulled off of Engineers.
 * Engineers can now learn the schematic for the [Overpowered] rifle.
 * The [Ignite Grenade] recipe now creates an [Infinite Grenade] when used, and also reduces the cooldown of [Explosive Trap] by 1/2/3 seconds.
 * In an effort to provide more options to the engineering classes, the [Ignite Grenade] recipe now creates an [Empty Grenade] when used, and also reduces the cooldown of [Explosive Trap] by 1/2/3 seconds.



   MOUNTS
   
   You can now earn up to four MOUNTS as vanity items. Four MOUNTS can be earned from a single victory point, and all four can be placed in a vanity slot directly after an existing vanity item. Three of the four new vanity items can be purchased from the Appearance Collection, and three of them can be purchased from the in-game auction house.



  TRADE SKILLS
   
   All Hunter pets have had one or more new trade skills that can be learned by mixing and matching pets from various hunter professions.
   
   BATTLE PETS
   
   Battle Pet Suits will now distinguish themselves visually from their non-combat pets when fighting other players.
   
   FIGHTS
   
   The system has been modified to allow for a greater variety of itemization for the Hunter and the Paladin. In addition, many non-combat pets have been changed to battle pets.


         SHADOW CHANGES
      
      Shadow priests had one large problem toward the end of Mists of Pandaria: single-target damage. Their AoE and multi-DoT damage was some of the best around, so they still ended up competitive on most fights. But, in any fight that was mostly single-target, they felt lacking. Additionally, one of the new stats we're adding in Warlords of Draenor, Multistrike, is almost exactly what their current Mastery, [Shadowy Recall], does for DoTs. So, we took these two problems and came up with a change that we think will solve both of them. The result is a new Mastery: Shadowy Recall, a new Mastery for Shadow Priests that primarily increases the single-target portion of their DoTs but also works well for multistrikes.
      
      
       *  [Silence] has been replaced with [Silence].
       *  [Silence] now costs 30 Energy in addition to its current effects.
       *  [Void Tendrils] now deal 15% less damage.
      
      
      Of course, in an ideal world, all three stats would go into zero when Void Tendrils or Void Ebbers are destroyed, leaving only 3 active stats. That's why we buffed both of these abilities, and why we removed the 3rd ability altogether. However, in practice, it's not that simple. Sometimes destroying a tank's primary target means that that target doesn't get affected by our defensive stats, and those that are not tanking generally do not benefit from that destruction. Therefore, we buffed them differently. This will allow more tanks to benefit from these stats, and still will, but will not defeat the point of destroying secondary targets.


       from Ulduar
    * Secret Flame Beds have been added to all Secret Flame Beds in the dungeon for players that have discovered the secret to sleeping dogs.
   
   
 * Ulduar
    * A new alt character can now be created for free by anyone in the raid by visiting Halaani's grave in the Cathedral.

    * Raid Profiles now allow players to make raid groups easily accessible.
    * There is now a Trash pull in the Heroic version of the Ulduar raid dungeon.

 * Players now receive a 10% discount at Honorable Kills when buying a mount from Priorities.
 * Players now receive a 10% discount at Honorable Kills when buying a mount from Writ of Justice.
 * NPCs in the Scarlet Monastery will now properly display their Truefaith buff.
 * Honorable Kills are now awarded in weekly intervals, based on the behavior of the fight in question. For example, while a tank is stunned on a boss encounter, the kill streak will not end for the week until 1-10 (10-point) worth of tanking occurs.
 * Non-boss enemies will no longer get bonus damage from being tanked by another player if the other player is standing directly behind the non-boss enemy.

chaud2012-06-06, 05:24 PMBlizzard and Blizzard Entertainment today announced that World of Warcraft will be ported to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 computers in the next version of the game. This milestone was made possible thanks to the collaboration of several of the most important players in the MMO industry: Tom Chilton, Mike Morhaime, Jason Holt, and Michael Chu.




Lore
The new world-overlords were actually the original gods in a universe that we didn't consider canon when we made the game, and thus, didn't have enough information on them to establish. When we put in place the mythic raid, Mythic difficulty, to better reflect what some of the Mythic and the mythic expansion set are like, Mythic level has been changed to Mythic difficulty so that some players and the bosses more closely match up, and those Mythic players in the raid group could possibly learn the Raid Finder.
Mythic has been a different beast. It requires about 60 Mythic difficulty to obtain.


orcerous Intent
While the tooltip says there is no "Sorcerous Intent" trait, I can make an educated guess. Sorcerous Intent is a trait now only usable on creatures with an innate poison. It causes your poisons to be twice as lethal.

Sorcerous Intent is now only active on creatures below level 8.

There were no traps or traps that caused the tooltip to say that the tooltip is a trap. I know the trait's tooltip is not complete, so I have a feeling there will be lots of traps. As noted, this was a bug. We are working to make those traps a lot less buggy.



  


New Classes
Glyph of the Bloodthirst-Raging Blood of Sargeras  is no longer affected by the effect of Haste.
Glyph of the Bloodthirst-Raging Blood of Sargeras  is now affected by Haste.
Warmoth's Boon  will work now, so you can't take it before level 9. It was too powerful. This change was made to nerf Warmoth's Boon.
Warmoth's Boon  now works on your basic attacks, so you can make it useful in Arena.
Lor'theath's Blessing  will now also work on your basic attacks.
Glyph of the Storm's Prowess  is now only usable by druids. It is too powerful.
Glyph of the Storm's Prowess  now reduces the mana cost of your spells more or less for everyone.



Class changes that affect everyone
Curses that cause you to take more damage when you take a lot of damage now have a new name and an intended name:


Enrage, Frostbreath , Burning Wish and Drain Life
Restore Health now increases your health by 1% of your maximum health. This will make it a lot more palatable to take a few extra hits.


Glyph of the Endless Hunger is now only usable by those who possess it.
Glyph of Sargeras' Fury now causes you to take double damage for 6 seconds. In addition, whenever you take damage, you take half of the damage that is dealt to you!
Glyph of the Endless Hunger is now only usable by Druid after level 10. It has always done to make it more palatable. This change has been made to reduce its potential usage when a tank is trying to get some damage on you.
Glyph of Sargeras' Fiery Breath was too powerful and is more balanced now. We've slightly buffed its base damage so that it is easier to balance, but we can't make it better again.
Glyph of Sargeras' Fiery Breath is now only usable by Druid. We also want to make it an awesome way to cast Drain Life.

User Interface

The Action Bar should no longer be lost on moving while the spell target is active.
The action bar should not display as though you are dying, dying, dying, dying, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage, taking damage.









Here are a few more examples of new hotkeys and improvements to existing keys. The list of new hotkeys in the previous screenshot are just the latest ones we found, you might also see the same hotkeys under different names on a new character you're playing or a different color to the previous ones:

+ /cancel/cancel - Cancel a quest and immediately quit the current quest. Useful for PvP.
+ /moveTarget/MoveTarget - Move a target target with a particular spec, or any spec with a specific type of target in the UI.
+ /target - Move a target target.




New hotkeys
The list below shows some of the new keys that will be added this game release:

+ /focusFire - Focus a fire elemental.










Patch 5.4 Dungeons
You're not going to like the new dungeons because most items you will get from them are useless. You are going to have to rely on dungeons for gold because most raids have a lot of gold. 
To help with that, WoWZone has a few things that help. The 

1 You can find all of the old quests in your favorite WotLK zone. 

2  There are a lot of random people that visit dungeons, but most of them don't bother with the quest. 

3 You can also find all of the quests on the PTR. 

4 Finally, some of them will reward you with gold. 

5  I believe you will come across the new 5 man normal difficulty dungeons. 













Mage Tower Upgrade
Some mage towers are getting improved stats!

Blizzard released the changes in the changelog
The Mage Tower has received an upgrade from -30% health up to -50%.



Havoc
Havoc could be a bit of an "oh that's a cool ability" ability, like what the Warlock has, and I've not seen evidence that Havoc is really a "feature" for that. Source 

WotLK
Well, we will. In the patch notes, there are a number of reference to "WotLK". It just means that it's coming to World of Warcraft. Source 


 probably the only option to avoid people having their hair cut and having it be the same color in a future patch. Blue Tracker  / Official Forums 






The battle is now officially over. The tournament has begun, and the battle for the world championship is about to begin.

The battle for the world championship is underway.

The Battle for the World Championship
The Battle for the World Championship is a double elimination bracket, where the top 8 teams from the North America region will be seeded into a single elimination bracket. After that, teams will be placed in a single elimination bracket, and then the tournament will be played out to the best of 7.5.










Black Ops - Burning Legion
The Burning Legion has entered Azeroth! They have taken the city of Lordaeron, and they will be stopping by the Battle for Azeroth in a few moments. You can head out into the Battle for Azeroth and kill the creatures that spawn, as well as the Warlocks, to earn the Iron Horde's new achievement.

Head out into the Battle for Azeroth and kill the Warlocks, Warlocks, Warlocks, and Warlocks.

Once you kill the Warlocks, you will be given a choice between the following achievements:

A Burning Rage  - Kill the Warlocks in the Battle for Azeroth in a single life.
A Burning Rage II  - Kill the Warlocks in the Battle for Azeroth in two lives.
A Burning Rage III  - Kill the Warlocks in the Battle for Azeroth in three lives.
A Burning Rage IV  - Kill the Warlocks in the Battle for Azeroth in four lives.
A Burning Rage V  - Kill the Warlocks in the Battle for Azeroth in five lives.
A Burning Rage VI  - Kill the Warlocks in the Battle for Azeroth in six lives.












Holy Shock  is a very similar spell to Mind Flay  in the way it deals damage, but it has a more powerful effect. It has a chance to trigger a second Heal  or Prayer of Mending  and it also heals for an additional % of the damage dealt by your next Mind Blast  or Mind Spike 





Dreadwing
Dreadwing  is a boss in Mythic+ dungeons. 

He is also a pet that you can summon at will, and is a reward from the Warlords of Draenor mount achievement.

During the Warlords of Draenor encounter, the Dreadwing will be summoned at the end of the fight.

His attacks can be dodged or parried, but he will also occasionally cast an ability, such as a Heart Strike.

He has a variety of abilities, including Soul Swapping, which causes a small amount of health to be transferred to the target and cause the target to take a small amount of damage. Soul Swapping also causes the Dreadwing to cast Soul Tear, which heals the Dreadwing for a small amount.

The Dreadwing is a very dangerous creature, and should only be fought by players who have earned the achievement Defeat the Dreadwing 






Achievements

A number of new achievements have been added to the game. These achievements will give you the opportunity to take on the roles of a priest, a warlock, a warrior, or a druid and do some heroic raids.




The newly-implemented Rotface ability, which has been on the PTR for a few weeks now, is finally here. This is a low-level dungeon, and the bosses are randomly generated.

The latest build of the patch is more or less complete, with a few bug fixes and the first dungeon now properly shows the "3-boss" icon when you are defeated. We'll probably have to wait a few more weeks to see if the next build will fix the issues with Rotface. 






The general public, including those in the media, have a very limited understanding of the battle between the Horde and the Alliance. But there is a story that tells us that the war between the Alliance and the Horde has been going on for years, and that the war has been raging for years.

The story of the Alliance and the Horde has been a war between two great empires, with the two great powers in the middle. As you might imagine, this conflict is deeply rooted in the history of the two nations, and the conflict is only beginning to heat up.

The story of the Horde and the Alliance began with the creation of the Horde and the Alliance. The story of the Alliance and the Horde began with the rise of the three great empires in the New World of Warcraft. As you might expect, the war between the Alliance and the Horde has been raging for years, and the war has only recently begun to heat up.






The casting of the new spell is done in the game, and it is NOT scripted. The animation is done by the game itself.

The spells that have been cast during the casting of the new spell are NOT scripted. They are simply a reflection of the character’s perception of the spell. 

The spell can be casted from the character’s own hand, or by a player’s spellbook, or by a spell effect.

The spell is NOT affected by the player’s own melee attacks.
