It's no secret that we like having more variety in our itemization systems. After all, you never know what you might find in a mail slot. After all, you never know what you might find in a trading post. We've taken this same spirit into account when creating class item bonuses and stat buffs.

In order to make sure that we weren't leaving players behind in their build diversity, we decided to add a fourth buff to a specific spell: [Gladiator's Slicer].


====================
This week marks the 10th anniversary of the Guild Awards. During that time, we've seen the awarding of Guild Awards become a formalized way to recognize outstanding guild achievements, and the Guild Awards themselves become objects of celebration instead of punishment.
       * Guild Awards are now presented in the form of Guild Challenges. Win or lose, you will receive a Guild Challenge for a random guild in Guild History.
       * Guild Challenges can be won via the guild experience bar or by simply accepting the announcement on Twitter that a guild has an award. Acceptance of Guild Challenges is not required, but it is recommended.
       * Win a Guild Challenge for an existing guild that hasn’t seen enough awards ceremonies this year.
       * After winning a Guild Challenge, players have a chance to win an item that will allow entry to a randomly selected guild that has a similar theme to the guild they are challenging.
       * Announcements from past guilds supporting the guild challenging theme will be viewable on the guild leader board.
       * Successfully completing guild challenges and winning the guild challenge will earn credit for a new reputation category.
       * Once a guild has been granted credit for a particular theme, players can accept the guild challenge in any of the guild's chat channels (use /to accept for a guild challenge, /to lose for a guild challenge, /for all others) to gain access to that guild's chat channel.
       * Once accepted, players in that guild will be able to access the assigned guild chat channel (as seen here) through either their guild interface or the chat interface (coming soon to all major guilds).
       * Guild Leaders can invite a GM or a raid group for a given dungeon instance. A GM can be selected by the guild master or the guild leader based on the available roll call slot.
       * Upon accepting a guild challenge, players will be asked to fill out a Request for Raid or Warning Sheet. Both these sheets can be viewed in the guild leader support forum.
       * Once a player has accepted a guild challenge, they will be asked to fill out a Request for Player Help. This form allows the GM or the raid group to access the player directly while the player is out of the guild or out of the area (ex: /to request a player for raid group).
       * Once a player has submitted a raid or group for a given dungeon, they will receive an acknowledgement response email from the guild via the Guild Portal.
       * All requests for assistance are logged and tracked on the account, so players can access help from the account controls if they are experiencing any issues.
       * The account controls for a given realm are located on the same tab as the rest of the world, so players can access the account controls there as well.
       * The request log is now divided into sections for each type of request, allowing easier sorting of requests.
       * Players can now use the “Talk to a GM” function to submit a request and receive a response.
       * A link to the account controls page now provides a confirmation dialogue to allow players to select the account control that they would like to use.
       * A link to the account settings page now provides confirmation dialogue to allow players to modify the game client settings.
       * Players can now lock out additional features by clicking on the “Lock Out” button on the account screen.
       * Added a new option to toggle floating combat text on and off.
      
      NEW FEATURE: FACTION BANK
      
       * Once the player has established a reputation with at least one faction in Undercity, they will be able to open the account details of the other faction's bank to deposit funds and send/received items.
       * This new feature is available for players at Honored or Revered reputation levels, and is opt-in.
       * By using this feature, players can prove that they are a true supporter of a given faction.
      
      NEW FEATURE: REST STATE CHANGES
      
       * Players now have an additional layer of protection against being attacked while
       
       
 
   
 * Pets
   *  [Avoidance] (passive): Now reduces damage taken by 5% while dodgeable, but no
   longer reduces the amount of damage taken while dodgeable.
   *  [Cower]: Now reduces the amount of damage taken while dodgeable by 20%, but
   is no longer affected by Mastery.
   * Cower: Now reduces damage taken while dodgeable by 30% and increases damage
    taken by 10% while dodgeable by 60%.
   *  [Cower]: Duration is now 8 seconds, but can no longer be used in
    trades.      
       
       
        
   USER INTERFACE
   
    * Items that can be equipped are now sorted according to class in the inventory
      options. All item choice options are available in the Options menu.
    * As a side effect of this change, players will no longer be able to
      disconnect depending on the quality of the Battleground they are in.  
       
       
        *  [Blessing of Sanctuary], [Blessing of Kings], [Blessing of Sacrifice], and [Blessing of
   Protection] have been replaced with new spells: [Blessing of Kings], [Blessing
   of Sacrifice], [Blessing of Wisdom], [Blessing of Kings], [Blessing of Wisdom],
   and [Blessing of Sacrifice].
   
   HEALING UPDATES

Recently, receiving a healing aura from a Paladin's healing aura
will now heal you for the amount that you intended to receive it from the
heart.
   
   
   Champions of Light (Artifact trait)
       * There is now a new [Divine Prowl] PvP ability available to all
                                                
                     
     Stoneforge Quartermaster Azrael will now properly
   resurrect you with the Stoneforge Quartermaster's energy.     
          
          
                BLOOD CHANGES
      
      Blood type was the determining factor on the decisions Blizzard made in
        the course of their recent Resilience work. In order to properly
        balance the number of health and survivability of their damage
        mitigation, we've taken steps to remove that factor from the game. We
        will be making a Major Resolve patch to address this in a major way,
        reducing the number of points spent on Resilience by the same amount and
        merging it with baseline Resilience. As such, the Blood deathrattle we
        are making now has a smaller number of points to compensate for the
        removal of Resilience. The scaling and diminishing returns of those
        changes will continue to be the focus of the discussion of scaling and diminishing
        returns for different stats.
      
      
       * Blood deathrattlers now start with a healthy amount of health, but will burn more
         health per blood point (while in [Resilience]) upon death. This will
         be different for each class, specialization, and tree.
         

            / [Rapture] can now be cast anywhere in the world
             and is a global cooldown.

         
BUG FIXES

 * Fixed an issue that caused certain Macs to become stuck.
 * Fixed an issue that caused some players in the East Coast to become
 
 
 
 
       PRIEST
      
      We've updated the wording of several abilities to clarify their function and intended behavior. To date, twenty-three abilities have been changed from passive to active abilities, and three of those have been multi-passive.
      
      
      In order to make room for more Haste effects to apply to [Focused Will], a priest's haste has been modified by the Multistrike stat. For example, a priest who had a base Haste of 4% using a 4-point talent (instead of a 3% Haste increase from a 3-point talent) would now receive a 4% increase to their base Haste amount instead of 3% for using that talent.
      
      
       *  [Guarded by the Light] now increases Stamina by 45% (up from 35%), and the amount healed by [Flash Heal] by 45% (up from 30%), but no longer increases healing done by [Heal].
       *  [Stance of the Wounded] has been removed.
       *  [Leap of Faith]'s mana cost has been reduced by 80%.
       *  [Spirit Shell] is now a level-25 talent, replacing [Spiritual Healing].
      
      
      We've also made a few other changes to the talents that bless specific spells. In particular, we've changed the way [Focused Will], [Divine Providence], [Guardian Spirit], and [Holy Light] are applied to the periodic healing effect of [Renew].
      
      
      
      
      
      WE ARE NOW A GROUP OF TALENTED GROUPS WHO PREACHES THE LAW OF NATURE AND VALOR AS WELL AS PVP.
      
       * We're looking for a group of players who are tough as nails and also some who may just be able to shed a few too many tears.
       * We're a group of players who follow the adventures of Queen Azshara. As such, we're a bit of a collection of professions.
       * Queen Azshara herself is a player-created encounter that can be found in icy Craggy Paths in Ashenvale. As such, players can make use of her unique abilities and play to win the encounter.
       * The best part? (Item #7692) is an item that just so happens to be on the same plane as the Wracked item that spawned him!
      
      
    * Also worth noting is the fact that the items that spawn under the appropriate class banner (Classes #11, Pets #11, etc.) now all share a single tabard slot.
    * Also worth noting is the fact that many of the items on this new tabard are of the Fetid variety. Fetid in appearance, functionally speaking.
    * Also of note is the fact that each class can now craft up to 4 item of the Fetid variety (Classes #11, Pets #11, etc.).
    
    
          
      
    * New Level-60 Ability: [Ritual of Summoning]
       * Summons a random raid or world raid boss.
       * Cooldown is 1 minute, duration is 1 minute.
       * Maelstrom Weapon emote now has a visual that identifies it as an Enrage ability.
       * Ability has a 3-minute cooldown.
      
      
      
      
           MAGE
      
      ABILITY PRUNING
      
      See the ability pruning section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For mages, we focused thinning out the niche and abilities that weren't used often. We made sure to retain abilities for mages to function in off-spec roles, since that flexibility is a defining characteristic of the class.
      
      
       *  [Arcane Barrage] has been removed.
       *  [Arcane Concentration]: The damage reduction afforded by this talent now exists, but is unavailable to the Warrior.
       *  [Arctic Winds] is no longer available to the Mage.
       *  [Remove Magic] is now available to the Priest.
       *  [Remove Curse] is now available to the Warlock.
       *  [Shatter] is no longer available to the Warlock.
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
             TALENT SYSTEM
      
      Like priests, mages have a talent system. Talents are now earned by completing quests. Focused on clearcasting, the talent system provides a mechanism for rewarding specialization in PvP.
      
      
       *  [Clergy Training] is now available to players who have completed the class quest [70] Seeking Arcane Power.
       *  [Focused Prayers] has been removed and replaced with a new talent, [Evangelism]. 
          * Focused Prayers reduces the cost of [Devouring Plague], [Frost Fever], [Pestilence], and [Choking Fog] by 50% for 6 seconds each time it is cast.
         
         
       *  [Frost Presence] has been removed and replaced with a new talent, [Glacial Spike]. 
          *  [Ice Barrier]: Replaces [Ice Block]. Does not stack with other effects that increase the Priest's Defense.
          *  [Inner Focus]: Instead of redirecting all mana with a single use, this talent now increases the effect of all Mana Shield spells by 10/20/30% for 6 seconds each time it is used.
         







      ROGUE
      ABILITIES
      
      A number of abilities were added for rogues to aid in their adventivist pursuits. In addition to the new abilities provided by the Assassin class, rogues now also receive a bonus to secondary stat bonuses (Critical Strike, Mastery, etc.) when [Assassination] is used in Stealth.
      
      
      *  [Blind] is now a passive ability. The damage and slow effects of Blind will not be applied to the rogue if they are attacked while Blinded.
