Nether Tempest is the one talent you need to get started with. It's not a core talent, but it's a good one.

Let's start with a little background.

What is Nether Tempest?
It's a new talent available in Cataclysm, it's available to all characters on your account, and it's a proc.

What does it do?
It's a new talent that increases the critical strike chance of Nether Tempest by 15% for 10 seconds. This is increased to 50% for 10 seconds after Nether Tempest has been cast.

When does it proc?
The proc rate depends on whether the target is in a Nether Tempest, in a Nether Tempest, or in a Nether Tempest.

How does it work?
The effect is triggered when the target has Nether Tempest on them. It's a global effect. You can't have Nether Tempest on yourself.

What is the benefit of having Nether Tempest on a target?
It's a good idea to have Nether Tempest on a target, especially when you have a Nether Tempest on a friend. It's not a good idea to have Nether Tempest on your friend's character.

What do you mean by that?
It's a global effect, it's a proc, it's a global, it's a global. You can't have Nether Tempest on yourself.

I'm not trying to be rude, but I'll just say this, Nether Tempest is a nice little buff to help you survive a boss fight.

What is the problem with having Nether Tempest on a target?
You can't have Nether Tempest on your own character, or you won't be able to use Nether Tempest.

Why not have it on your own character?
It's a nice little buff to help you survive a boss fight. It's not a good idea to have Nether Tempest on your own character.

It's a nice little buff to help you survive a boss fight. It's not a good idea to have Nether Tempest on your own character.

We can't have Nether Tempest on your own character because that's not cool enough.
We've never said that Nether Tempest is cool enough. We think we have enough of a reason to have it on our own character.

Q. Will there be another level of rewards to earn in order to achieve the goals above?
A. Most likely, yes. The goal will be to earn both an Honor rating as well as a Bronze medal. We want players to feel amazing about the achievement and it's not going to feel like we're giving them a reason to do more content.

Q. How many new PvP zones can you tell us of?
A. There are currently 12 PvE zones in the game.

Q. You've said before that "We don't think we've done anything wrong in the past." How is the game designed to allow players to customize their own experience?
A. We don't have a large amount of story in the game, and our story always begins and end within the MMO.


So, before everything happens in this episode, here's what your Alliance is looking for in this upcoming fight:
Your Alliance is asking for something from us.
An Alliance Hero.
You are a member of the Alliance.
You will need a Hero's Circle to do it.
You will need a Hero of the Black Temple to carry out the mission for you.
You will need Hero of Azshara to assist you in this fight.
You have reached this point of combat with a Hero you have never fought before. You are ready to stand up against the other members of the Circle.
You have been killed and there is no one else there to save you.

Q. It’s said that the PvP in World of Warcraft is just a way to provide some fun for people who enjoy PvP. For many players, it seems as though the gameplay is more rewarding when PvP is fun: It gives players a chance to kill and loot others to achieve victory. Is there any truth to that? What makes this PvP different







to me like a bunch of kids on Halloween, with nothing but a bottle of pumpkin spice, like "I have to keep my powers." I can’t imagine them doing the opposite, though I do wish they never made these things. We just don’t want to see them used for anything else besides to create some kind of Halloween costume.
All right, good point! I am just saying that the ability for me to be in the party of the night is a big thing in my mind.

How would you describe the playerbase? What do you think the community wants to see? Is this a problem in the design?
I have been playing WoW since 2004 and I have no idea what you have seen yet, so I would say that the community is kind of a blank slate.

I have been a professional game designer and I can tell you that I have never been in a group that had all the abilities they are currently seeing offered. The "game design" is often a joke, and players have a certain amount of empathy toward it, but rarely do they actually test it out. These are usually the players that do not play an MMORPG, and they do not actually play the game they play.

How much can you give us a good idea of what people want today? How much of the game is you?
I can say in my opinion the community values the game at a level they are likely to accept more and more, even though it is a new thing. This is my impression, and I know it is a fair opinion, but we also know a lot of others have to agree as well.

How do you see the world of games as you see it today?
I think we will see more and more players who want more, just like we see more and more people who want fewer and fewer things than now. That isn't an unreasonable expectation by any stretch.

What do you think should be removed from MMO design? I understand where we are coming from when we say "it's a good idea to be more about this or that" but I think that is only a symptom of that issue. You can always come back and say "This is a good idea, why not a new feature". I think it can't be that easy to come up with a new or even a better game.

I think it was good that Blizzard's approach was to not remove the old MMO from the market. If you don't like it, we don't get that, but if you are the only one who does and are still coming here , we don't get that either. I think the community is more likely to have a good view of the game instead of looking for the next best thing.
If we have too many changes to consider and a new player is going to be in, we have too many changes to consider.

What else is working in your opinion as a fan.
I think the current design is not working well right now. It's frustrating when it feels like the player isn’t going to be a player at all. You might see the game as a new and relatively unfamiliar player, which is a great design, and the most compelling reason we make MMOs, right?

If you want to talk about changing mechanics, they might be one of the best things in the game to do. You can make the player feel like what they are doing is interesting, but there should only be very good reasons to do something that isn’t a new feature. We have a long tradition of making new features and changing them based on player feedback. This is why we don't want to see a game where players can either take the experience and get to know the mechanics or just say to the devs to just ignore them, but it’s okay. Some ideas are always better and some ideas are always just more fun.

You do agree that players aren’t going to keep coming back to old games to play?
I'm not sure if they want to. The old MMO may not work for you, but maybe they are tired of it and are willing to give in. If this happens you should consider whether there is a better new MMO out there somewhere else. That is often the message I hear, so it’s a good idea to have some kind of community feedback.

What is your view on the state of World of Warcraft and MMO Design? Do you think that some of the features and concepts are not that great and that MMO design isn’t getting to a point where the players are able to enjoy it?
I think MMO Design is getting so far off track. I don't think it's fair to say MMO Design has become less. I don't want to hear you saying that MMO Design doesn’t work, but if you say that it doesn’t work and that new ideas are bad ideas, you are simply not thinking.





You guys have pretty much always had a "skill is hard" mantra. Are there ever more than 2 professions which are difficult to have/have?
Actually yes. I mean, it used to be "I can only get on one beast" and "I cant get on two mounts" but it just got to be very obvious as the 2nd specialization. It's kinda a double-edged sword. I really don't think we've found a perfect balance yet. I don't say that it's one of those rare cases but we do think it might be the case.



Q. Are you aware that players want to be able to do things other than be solo players or guilds for longer hours? If so, what have you done to provide these more options? How do you feel about this feature being more available?
A. This one is easy -- we have added multiple options for players to choose to be more or less on their own and not have to depend on the system as a whole for the duration of their raid. On a personal note, the fact that an encounter you can do for up to 3 days that everyone wants to do, is much more enjoyable, than say a raid where you can only do that to 30% is a huge improvement.

Q. What does your team think about the addition of the new raid options? Are they helpful for new player experience or at least for raiders who have never done dungeons before?
A. This is our hope -- as with all the new content that the team has been working on, we hope to let players have a great time doing what they want without the fear or the expectation that you will be able to do things that other players will get bored of and won't be able to.

Q. Some of your fans still have the need to complete content faster and faster. You've taken a strong stance against speedruns as well. How do you think speedruns have impacted the experience of the game?
A. Speedruns have always made the experience of the game and so it's good for many players as well, though it does make for a very bad experience for those who like slow, quick, or quick wins. We think some of the current design space would benefit from being able to offer a different type of experience, but there would have to be additional systems for achieving the same ends.

Q. Players like the idea of having to do something new while leveling. Do you plan to make new content faster for them and not provide old content faster?
A. While no one likes new content, we do want players to have a lot of the time of doing an old content to come back. To that end however, we also do want the new content to be in the same place as the old content.
