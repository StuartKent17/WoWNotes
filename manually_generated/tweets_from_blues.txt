What's the plan to fix this? I feel like every time I look at the new models they're like a new one
We like the new models, but they just don't fit the game. WarcraftDevs 

Why do the Druids get a nerf in the expansion? I love the flavor.
The flavor is great. It's just that it's just not in the game. WarcraftDevs 

How much work do you guys do to balance the new trees? I'm confused on how it'll be balanced.
It's a huge challenge. We need a lot of help. WarcraftDevs 

Why did the Balance changes take so long to make? It was a major nerf.
It was a major nerf. WarcraftDevs 

Why did the Balance changes take so long to make? It was a major nerf.
It was a major nerf. WarcraftDevs 

why is the Feral Druid nerfed in the expansion? I love it.
It's just a nerf. It's not a nerf, it's a nerf. WarcraftDevs 

Why do we get so many new classes in the expansion? I love the new models.
It's just a nerf. It's not a nerf, it's a nerf. WarcraftDevs 

Why are you removing the Druid talent tree? Its a great talent.
Because we think it's too hard to balance. WarcraftDevs 

Why are we removing the Druid talent tree? Its a great talent.
It's not a nerf, it's a nerf. WarcraftDevs 

Can we get any more details on the new leveling system?
It's a leveling system. It'll be much easier to work with. WarcraftDevs 

Will the new leveling system work on player level 100+ or will it be mandatory?
Both. WarcraftDevs 

With the new leveling system, what will we be able to earn?
You'll be able to earn a level 100+ character for free. WarcraftDevs 

Why is the leveling system being removed from the game?
Because we don't think it's a good way for the game to have to constantly adjust and change to keep pace with player activity. WarcraftDevs   





Classes
Well we're doing a lot of things wrong. Maybe we can fix it, maybe we can't fix it.
I think it's important to keep in mind that we're trying to fix it, but it's hard to do that in a way that doesn't make things worse. WarcraftDevs 

Character / Items
What's the point of the crafting system? I'd hate to be a slave to it.

Healing
Don't overthink it. I'm not going to do the exact opposite. I just think it would be a mistake to have no mana regen or any regen. We're there to balance around. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
We're always interested to hear feedback about PvP. It's the reason why we don't have a lot of it in the game. We have a lot of ideas we are working on but we don't have anything ready to share just yet. WarcraftDevs

How do you feel about the Pandemic mechanic in WoW? I'm curious if the people who love it don't think it's a good idea or something that could be changed?
It's a fun mechanic. It's a mechanic that I am very fond of. WarcraftDevs 

Guilds
I'd love to see more examples of guilds that are raiding and the guilds that aren't raiding.
We love raiding and we like raids. It's fun for us. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
In the last couple weeks, a lot of people have been asking us to change the PvP system. It's a big undertaking, so we're still figuring out how to make it work. WarcraftDevs 

Warlords of Draenor
What's the current plan? I've seen a lot of people say it would be fun to raid with but I think it would be a little boring without the warlords.
We are doing the same thing. We are going to make a raid tier. It's a great idea. WarcraftDevs 

Misc
What is the current plan for the PvE department? I'm just curious if the PvP department has any plans to change that?
We are going to have a PvP tier. It's a great idea. WarcraftDevs 

Any chance of adding in a new profession like alchemy or smithing?
No, but we have a lot of ideas for things that we would like to do. WarcraftDevs 

PvP
Why is it that in WoW you guys like to play PvP but don't like to PvP? I am surprised to hear that you guys aren't into it.
We don't think it's a problem for PvP, but we are concerned about the PvP system in PvP. WarcraftDevs 

Is the current PvP system in WoW intended to be an option for all classes or is there some sort of limit?
The PvP system is meant to be a choice. It's not meant to be a mandatory option. WarcraftDevs 

What's the current plan for the PvP department? I am curious if it's a new option for everyone or is there some sort of limit?
The PvP system is meant to be a choice. It's not meant to be a mandatory option. WarcraftDevs 

Misc
I have a question about how many people are able to play the beta?
We're going to keep the beta open for everyone. WarcraftDevs 

Guilds
What about guilds that only raid and don't raid?
We do want to keep guilds that raid. WarcraftDevs 

Will the current guild system be able to be changed in the future?
No, but we are looking into options. WarcraftDevs 

Do you have any plans to add in the ability to raid as a tank in the future? I have a couple friends that are tanking, but I don't think they want to be.
No. WarcraftDevs 

Is there any chance we can see the new raid tier for all raid tiers in the future?
Yes. WarcraftDevs 

Lore
I have a question about the lore behind the current night elves. I'm really curious about what is the story behind the night elves.
The night elves are a part of the Horde. WarcraftDevs

Any chance of adding in the ability to swap class changes between races?
It would be great to do. WarcraftDevs 

Will the new Frost and Unholy DKs be able to swap class changes?

Healers can't heal at the moment, but are going to keep an eye on the situation. Source 

LFR/Mythic/Mythic/Mythic/Mythic/Mythic
I've seen a lot of players on the forums go on a rant about the healing mechanics. I'm not sure I understand the point of the comment, but I'm also not sure what the intent of the comment was. Source 

Champion's Call
I'm not sure how the mechanic works, but it's an interesting idea. Source 

How about I heal a raid and I give the healers a chance to heal a random player?
You could probably do that. Source 

What if I heal a raid and the healers have to swap out?
That's a nice mechanic. It's a little hard to get your hands on a nice mechanic. Source 

Why is a heal that is a healer always going to be better than a heal that is a rogue?
We like to give classes a lot of variety, but it's difficult to do that with the way the mechanics work. Source 

If healers were balanced like tanks, would all healers be better than rogues?
That's a very interesting concept. It's something we're going to keep an eye on. Source 

The problem is that healers don't get to choose their spec and don't have any other options.
We're trying to find ways to make healers more viable. Source 

How do you feel a tank is going to play in an 8/8 healer rotation? It seems to me they're more focused on tanks.
We think tanks can be a little different in a lot of ways. Source 

A lot of healers think they're the only ones who can heal. They're wrong. They're not the only ones.
We don't think they're the only ones. We think you can do a lot of different things in a tank. Source 

I'm curious what would happen if healers were a 4/4 healer rotation.
I think it would be interesting. It's an interesting idea. Source 

Can you explain how to fix the healing in the encounter? It seems to me the tank just doesn't do enough damage.
The problem is that healers don't get to choose their spec and don't have any other options. Source 

Would a rogue tank be a better tank?
You could argue that there are other tanks that do a lot of damage, but there are also other tanks that are really good at tanking. Source 

I'm curious if you think druids can do a lot of tanking in a raid.
They can. I think there are a lot of druids that want to do more damage in a raid. Source 

I've heard the tanking meta is getting out of control. I'm thinking of changing it.
It's hard to change it. There's a lot of changes to be made, but that's a long process. Source 

You don't think the tanking meta is a problem? If you're a healer, how can we make it less so?
I think it's a problem. I think there are a lot of healers that would like to do more damage in a raid. Source 

Is it the case that you're trying to keep healers as unique as possible in WoW?
I think there's a lot of players that want to do more damage in a raid, and that's cool. Source 

What about melee DPS? What about Protection DPS?
I think it's a challenge for us to keep tanking cool. We want to make sure there are options. Source 

So I'm thinking of maybe making the tanking talent more interesting in the future?
That's a great idea. I think it would be a lot of fun to do that. Source 

Can you talk a little bit about the way healing is going to be handled in the next major content patch?
I think we have some work to do. The raid buff system is going to be a big part of that. Source 

It sounds like the healers are going to be really important to the future of WoW.
I think the players who are interested in raiding want to be able to raid. I think that's a good thing. Source 

I've been playing a warrior for about 3 years. I think you're a good example.
I think the current healing system is a little weak. It's hard for us to get that balance right. Source 

Can you tell us a little bit about how the new one works? Will it be similar to the current system?
It'll be a lot of different systems. It's not the same system. Source

I'm not sure why you think it's the 'right' thing to do in PvP, but I am very interested in your thoughts on this one.
It's not a bug, it's just something we have to take into account when designing abilities for PvP. Celestalon 

any thoughts on having the new PvP gear cost the same as the old PvP gear? 
It's a trade-off, but it's something we think the community would be interested in. Celestalon 

Can you explain how you guys feel that PvP gear is 'worth it' to a non-player?
I think the way PvP gear is valued is a big part of why we think PvP is such a fun game. Celestalon 

Is it the same for PvE and PvP gear?
It's worth it to PvE gear. Celestalon 

Any plans to introduce any kind of PvP gear rewards to the new PvP gear?
We're interested in the idea, but it's not something we're sure we'd like to do. Celestalon 

What about PvP gear for PvE gear? It's a different thing for PvP gear.
We don't think PvP gear should be worth the same as PvP gear. Celestalon 

Any thoughts on keeping the PvP gear for PvP gear? It's a different thing for PvE gear.
We think PvP gear should be worth the same as PvE gear. Celestalon 

What about PvP gear for PvP gear? It's a different thing for PvP gear.
We think PvP gear should be worth the same as PvP gear. Celestalon 

Why can't we just remove the PvP gear from the PvP gear? I like PvP gear.
We think PvP gear is a good way to reward players who are active in PvP. Celestalon 

I hate PvP gear. It's not that I dislike PvP, but I just hate the way it's being used to justify a system that's supposed to be designed to be fun.
I hate the way PvP gear is being used to justify a system that's supposed to be fun. Celestalon 

When you guys get your gear nerfed, it will be a lot harder for everyone to get it back to normal.
I'd be very surprised if it's an issue. We're trying to make sure we're not over-nerfing. Celestalon 

What about PvP gear for PvP gear? It's a different thing for PvP gear.
It's a good thing to get PvP gear for PvE gear, but we don't think it's a good thing to get PvP gear for PvP gear. Celestalon 

Would you guys like to see PvP gear be equalized or make it a non-factor?
We'd like to make PvP gear equal for PvP and PvE. Celestalon 

PvP gear is a little outdated. Why not make it equal for PvE gear?
It's a good thing to have in PvP gear. It's a bad thing to have in PvE gear. Celestalon 

I have a problem with PvP gear. It's a lot of work to get it right.
I don't think PvP gear is the problem. It's the players who are putting the effort in. Celestalon 

Will the PvP gear ever be equal for PvE gear?
Yes. Celestalon 

How will PvP gear be affected by the nerf? It was always equal in PvP.
We don't think PvP gear is the problem. It's the players who are putting the effort in. Celest

It's an interesting conversation, but it's hard to know how much it has to do with how you're trying to work as a team, and how much it has to do with how the game is.
I think it's a great conversation and I think the team is trying to find that balance. Celestalon 

As you have noted, the healers in the raid are doing too much healing, and the healing in the raid is too low. Is there anything that can be done to get the raid back to being close to the ideal?
We're trying to find that balance. It�s hard to tell what the ideal is. We�re not perfect, but I think we have the ability to find that balance. Celestalon 

It seems to me that the nerf to healing in 5.4 is a deliberate one, to make the raid feel more punishing.
The raid nerf was part of the tuning process. Celestalon 


why not nerf Feral Shaman's taming in 10% dps to compensate for the lack of taming talent?
We don't think it's a big deal. We think it's a really fun ability. Source 

Are we going to see a new talent for Shapeshift in WoD?
That's a cool idea. We just need to figure out how to make it fit. Source 


Why is it that hunters are still able to do all their damage while tanking?
Because they're a lot more fun in PvP. Source 


What's the difference between the 2 new Blackout Kick, it's still a stupid ability
It's a dumb ability. We're trying to get to the point where we don't need it. WarcraftDevs 

Can you give us a hint as to when we can expect to see the new Shaman spell, Wild Mushroom?
It's in the game files. WarcraftDevs 

Tanks in PvP
We are trying to bring tanks into PvP. This includes:

Tanking in PvP
Tanks in PvP

Will the Vampiric Touch nerf be in a similar place as it is in PvP?
Yes. WarcraftDevs 




Gnome Tweets
If gnomes were introduced in the old days and never played WoW, the result would be the troll. Celestalon 

[...] It is not necessary to have a good player game with a good server. You are doing a more valuable job at the same time. Celestalon 
[...] I find it more important than ever for me to manage my own game. I would also strongly suggest that you are responsible for your own game and not the other way. Celestalon 

The old days were all about the raid team!
We don't make MMOs to make your life easier, our game was designed by people. You could take the time to read the original beta notes to see what the changes were, but you probably wouldn't be in a lot of trouble. Celestalon 

Lore
I still like the lore, but the real question is, why not go back and add more lore into the game?
It's not really a good use of my time. It would help immensely. And yeah, most of us like lore when we read it. Celestalon 

Can you explain why you want to keep Lore "borrowed" so much?
"We love it," I said "Because players love a little bit of lore that has been brought up in the past." That seems pretty reasonable to me, is it not an issue that it does not carry itself, or will it? Celestalon 

Why would you want to keep Lore? Why not just make more lore out of it?
It is one of the main reasons I have gotten into WoW. I play like a troll. I like to be a little mischievous. Celestalon 

I really liked the Lore in Cataclysm, but now I hate the feeling of nostalgia.
The main reason I still play WoW is it has been a great experience but is the same reason I love my roleplaying games, I do the same thing from time to time, when I feel they are appropriate. 

Will you return to the lore from the old days, or be more explicit in how you want to play the lore?
Both.
