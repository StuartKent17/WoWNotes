      INVENTORY IMPROVEMENTS
      
      Over the years, we've added over 50 new recipes to the inventories of the various factions. Unfortunately, many of these new recipes were in places we hadn't previously checked. After much internal deliberation, we've decided to make these new recipes available to everyone. If you've discovered a new recipe, you can pick it up from the inventories of one of the factions in one of the following ways:
      
      
       * By visiting one of the four gateways provided by the various Iron Horde factions (à la [80] Path to Power).
       * By speaking with an NPC in one of the many capital cities (à la [Paradise] or Bank of the Historian).
       * By visiting one of the many NPCs that give quests (à la the "NPCs in the City").
       * By using the Quest Tracker located in the bottom right corner of the mini-map (à la [Find A Grave]).
       * By using the Quick Join system, which is located in the bottom left corner of the mini-map, players can be automatically entered into group chats.
       
       
             NEW QUEST HUB
      
       * A new quest hub has been added to the Stair of Destiny located in the eastern Barrens. You'll be able to queue for Warlords content by visiting the new quest hub.
       * A Warlords quest hub has been added to the Stair of Destiny located in the Eastern Plaguelands.
       * An Inn has been added to the Stair of Destiny for players that are still unable to gain access to the Stormwind or Orgrimmar via the instance portal.
       * All available dungeons and raids are now available via the "D" key. Please note that all dungeons and raids are not available via this channel; all such dungeons and raids will be re-opened with a live server one day after release.
       * Loot from the loading screens of Deadmines, Mistsong, and Terokkar Forest has been moved to the Loot Tab.
       * An "Ammo Slot" has been added to the top of the right-click menu. Ammo will no longer automatically reload into this slot. You can activate this slot by clicking the Ammo Slot icon next to the right side of the action bar.
       * Quest rewards in Alterac Valley for each faction now have a new, unique icon. Quest rewards from earlier Warlords content are still available via this tab.
       * Loot from the loading screens of all raid encounters now has an icon. Previously, only available from raid bosses were hidden in plain sight.
       * A new loading screen has been added to the loading screens of Tears of a Jedi Knight, Wretched Skiver, and The Missing Rogue quest.
       * An "Ammo Slot" has been added to the top
       
       
 Mark of Arthas, a rare quality invitation, has been added to existing Mark of Arthas instances.
DUNGEONS
NEW WORLD BOSSES

Now that Arthas and his men have breached the Dark Portal, the Lich King's forces have
turned the dangerous dungeon into a veritable war zone. With the help of the demon hunters of
Arathi Highlands, the Alliance and Horde have begun scouting the Kun-Lai
and have begun sending reinforcements.




CITIES AND FACTIONS
NEW HIGHEST DUNGEON RAIDING IN THE MACAU


Players who join the Highmant or Highmountain West factions to fight on behalf of Tauren or Horde
will receive a new raid structure: the Highmant, held by the Tauren and Horde.
This raid structure will allow players to form a powerful
monk bond with an NPC ally, and work together to overthrow the current
current ruler of Tauren or Horde. These raids will have weekly and daily bonuses and
tips, and are intended for a variety of raid composition.


The Highmant will be a hub of Tol Barad and Orgrimmar, the capital city of
the Alliance. The Highmountain West faction will extend the Reach and the Eastern Plaguelands
of the Horde in order to provide a foothold for the new raid structure.
